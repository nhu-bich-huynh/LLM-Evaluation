"Therefore, I would ask the Commission this: will it hold its grudge, despite the crisis in the motor industry, or will it change course in light of this crisis?"
"(NL) Madam President, it is telling that the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry is here but not the Commissioner for Competition."
"I have major reservations about helping out the car industry."
"Whilst the problems are undeniably very serious, why support the car industry and not other sectors?"
"The problems have possibly been exacerbated, but certainly not caused, by the credit crunch, and state aid should not be a reward for bad behaviour."
"Although the EU Treaty allows for rescue aid, we should not use tax money - which, after all, is paid for by the public - to keep ailing industries afloat."
"Neither should we forget that huge amounts of money have already gone into the rescue of car manufacturers in recent years - not always successfully, I should add."
"While we have a short-term responsibility for jobs that are on the line, we also have a long-term responsibility to leave behind a healthy economy, a healthy environment, and also healthy state finances for future generations."
"I find it a bit unfair that there has been no money for care, education, child care or the environment for years, and that we are now being asked to pump billions into the car industry to save it from disaster."
"If aid is given, there should be stringent conditions for what the car industry must do in return in the form of restructuring, and this should apply only to future-oriented, environmentally friendly and innovative activities; for, indeed, whilst state aid may be able to rescue companies, it can also ruin other companies as a result of distortions of competition."
"(FR) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this has already been said several times."
"The automotive industry, directly or indirectly, accounts for 12 million jobs within the European Union."
"That represents 10% of European GDP."
"The automotive industry is today facing a serious crisis: the European market has fallen by around 15%."
"This decline could reach 17% to 20% for the final quarters of 2008."
"Manufacturers' results are falling."
"In this context, the lack of funds is the primary danger facing this industry."
"Consequently, the manufacturers are cutting production and trying to reduce structural costs."
"Jobs become the first victims of the crisis."
"As you said, Mr President, faced with this crisis, what is needed is a coordinated response from Europe and the Member States, especially those directly concerned."
"The financial support of the EIB that is planned is necessary."
"Of course, I endorse your proposals."
"Firstly, we must support investment, particularly for the design and development of clean vehicles and the development of hybrid and electric vehicles."
"We must also support the market through financial incentives to renew those cars on the road."
"As the Commissioner said, old cars account for a significant part of the pollution generated by cars as a whole."
"However, we must also set up a stable and ambitious but realistic regulatory framework."
"The objectives for reducing CO2 emissions must be upheld, manufacturers have devoted - and are still devoting - large amounts to this, but realism must plead in favour of restraint in the fines imposed for failing to achieve the objectives."
"Excessive fines would eliminate general manufacturers."
"Let us not forget that the automotive industry is the industry hit by the toughest ecological requirements."
"Finally, in the current circumstances, it would be detrimental to the manufacturers to undermine the protection covering external bodywork parts."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think this debate we are having on one of the most critical sectors in the European economy is timely."
"The world economy is getting worse and worse and the already negative context for the car industry in Italy and in Europe is also deteriorating."
"The minister referred to the data earlier; there has been a marked fall in sales of 5% in 2008."
"Italy has seen a fall of over 18% in October alone, which is the worst figure in over ten years in the sector."
"This is thus a crisis which is affecting all the most important European markets, but I would like to stress that it is not just the car production sector that is feeling the effects of the crisis, but the whole supply chain, with a particularly detrimental impact on firms specialising in producing components for cars."
"As has been said, the crisis is hitting the whole sector, and merely by way of example I will mention the situation in Italy on the Tuscan coast where, in recent months, following relocation processes, recourse has been had on a massive scale to the wages guarantee fund, imposed on hundreds of workers, and to the dismissal of employees working on temporary contracts."
"One example, among many, gives us an idea of how very serious the situation is, and that is the Delfi group, whose workers have been relying on the wages guarantee fund for two and a half years."
"Urgent steps are needed to redeploy them, starting with the efforts initiated by local government bodies."
"It is now clear, however, that there is a partial impotence on the part of national, regional and local institutions, and hence a need for strong commitment and action by Europe, including confronting the multinationals on the problems of relocations and thus the need to adopt, Europe-wide, measures designed to contain this crisis in order to avoid the impact in social and employment terms."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis is teaching us that we need to go back to the real economy and thus we need to help the European manufacturing industry to recover, particularly at a time when the US, led by Barack Obama, is preparing to change economic relations worldwide to some degree."
"There should be no talk of State aid, but we ought to strengthen our manufacturing industry in three areas: recycling, which should be understood in the same way across Europe, the repositioning of production to focus on innovative sectors and the provision of information to consumers and significant action within the World Trade Organisation to rebalance customs tariff barriers, most of all in relations between the European Union and the Far East."
"Additionally, we must not forget investment in research in the sector and also in large-scale infrastructure, both tangible and intangible."
"We must play a fair game within the world."
"Today, the rules are changing, and we need to use the conclusions of the G20 to go back to an equal departure point."
"(SV) Madam President, jobs are what is important around Europe now."
"What we are seeing within the motor industry is an industrial challenge that is also characteristic of other parts of the European economy."
"What must not be allowed to happen now is for us to have a situation whereby state aid undermines employment in companies in one country but boosts it in another."
"We cannot have state aid that is to the detriment of the industry within one area and to its benefit in another area, because that would lead to unemployment and a loss of jobs that would proceed across Europe step by step."
"We must not have state aid that makes things more difficult for vibrant companies and keeps afloat companies that can no longer survive alone."
"The problem in the motor industry is a long-term one that we have seen more clearly in this financial crisis, but where we have, for a long time, seen large-scale losses and weakening demand around the world, as well as overcapacity."
"What is important now, first and foremost, is to ensure that demand exists in Europe."
"This means tax cuts in order to make it possible for there to be demand from European households for the products that are produced here."
"It means ensuring that European industry is able, in area after area, to be a leader in terms of technology and development, as well as within the environmental and energy sectors too."
"That is where public efforts should be focused."
"Yet it also means clearing the way for the European motor industry to be a global player."
"This means ensuring that we can have open free trade in which the European motor industry has access to world markets."
"It is therefore important to remember that those who stand in the way of free trade and progress in the Doha Round today are, in actual fact, hindering the opportunities for the European motor industry to grow in the large markets of the future."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, faced with the extremely serious crisis that is affecting the car sector from the US to our continent, Europe has a very clear choice: either to remain inactive and observe this collapse in demand and production, the effects of which we cannot even calculate today, in the name of an abstract consistency with a theoretical model of market liberalism, with total respect for competition, as some voices have urged here today, or to take on its responsibilities to tackle the situation properly."
"We have opted for the second choice and we call upon the Commission and the Council to show decisiveness and determination."
"We welcomed what Commissioner Verheugen said and we hope that none of his colleagues hold him back too much in this determination."
"This is an exceptional situation and thus exceptional responses are required."
"On the other hand, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has shown us some actions by political and economic authorities who have made choices in terms of conduct and investment of public resources which, up until a few months ago, would have been unthinkable."
"Our action should, however - and I am just finishing - be selective, combine strategy with urgency, and should encourage, both through more attractive loans and support for demand, a selective repositioning towards more environmentally sustainable production."
"Madam President, in my view, Europe's car industry has shown remarkable resilience in the past few years, despite some extremely tough economic conditions and a veritable deluge of EU legislation."
"Our car manufacturers lead the world for environmental awareness, technical standards and innovation."
"It is a record that deserves to be supported and not undermined."
"I am particularly proud of the UK car industry and, if I may, would like to make a plug for my local Nissan company - the most productive car plant in Europe - which is located in my region in North-East England."
"Nobody would dispute the importance of environmental protection, but I am extremely concerned that, in our rush to prove our green credentials, we are sometimes in danger of destroying a very important and successful industry."
"Already we are seeing a massive fall in sales in the UK."
"Sales last month were down 23%."
"Rather than imposing a very rigid and inflexible timetable for change in the industry, we should be seeking to support the industry and give it the incentive to make the changes that are necessary to bring about their future."
"If the car industry has our political support - and our political support for the supplier and component industries too - we can help them to get through this difficult period."
"I hope that the Commission will be extremely vigilant with regard to Member States stretching the limits on state aid to car manufacturers."
"In Britain, we have a very long and a very unsuccessful history of state support for the auto industry."
"We managed to get out of that in the 1980s."
"I hope we will not go back there again because, if we pour public money into the car industry, what about the building industry, the construction industry and the food industry?"
"All industries are suffering and we must be extremely careful with the hard-pressed taxpayer's funds to ensure that we do not throw too much more of it into the car industry."
"This did not work in the past and will not work in the future."
"I hope the Commission will be extremely vigilant in keeping an eye on errant Member States that might be tempted down this unsuccessful road."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as has been said before, the car industry is a vital sector; indeed, it is a key sector for the European economy, providing, as it does, direct or indirect employment to 12 million people."
"This is enormous."
"I therefore believe that cheap loans for this key sector are more than justified, but this fresh money should obviously be put into new, environmentally friendly technologies."
"We can expect the European car manufacturers to join forces to an even greater extent when it comes to developing these new technologies, for example, to create affordable, high-performance batteries for electrical cars."
"We should recognise, moreover, that Europe itself has also made its share of mistakes."
"We have possibly invested too heavily in hydrogen, while we now need economical, electrical hybrid engines in the very short term."
"This is why we should, perhaps, adjust our priorities and projects, particularly in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development."
"It should be our ambition, and indeed why not, to have all new cars in Europe run on electricity, hybrid or not, by 2020."
"Why should this not be possible?"
"In order to achieve this, we need a prompt switch-over, which means that we must also invest in training the workers involved."
"Commissioner, we are counting on your agreeing that aid for training workers is a future-oriented and justified investment and that it is considered as such."
"Moreover, various manufacturers, including Ford in Genk and Opel in Antwerp, are already investing and making huge efforts, including on behalf of vulnerable groups of the labour market."
"It is, to my mind, justified to further encourage and reward policy of this kind."
"Finally, the CO2 legislation which we shall be approving in the next few weeks is the perfect opportunity to set our sights high."
"Crises invariably create opportunities."
"We now have to make a combined effort to create these next-generation cars."
"If we persevere now, then the European Union will dominate this market for decades to come, hence this appeal to the European manufacturers to abandon the trenches and go on the offensive."
"(FR) Madam President, what should be our strategy to overcome this crisis?"
"Right now, the facts are before us."
"The crisis is affecting all manufacturers and there is a knock-on effect hitting the 12 million European citizens who work in the automotive industry."
"We must think, first and foremost, of these workers and their families and we must make it our priority to protect them by answering this troubling question: what is the strategy needed to overcome this crisis?"
"A fast and effective united and structured industrial policy for the medium and long term, a 'new car deal', a coordinated response by Member States and the Union that will be equal to the situation."
"I hear, in this Parliament, the old dogmatic views of outdated liberalism resurfacing: no help, no subsidies, competition, nothing but competition."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for regulation, for public action."
"We therefore need a new car deal, an ambitious and intelligent plan for the automotive industry, first of all to save jobs and develop employment in Europe, with support for training."
"Then, to speed up the technological change of these enterprises to clean and intelligent vehicles, with the resolve to revive demand, by simplifying the renewal of old cars on the road, which are generators of pollution, through the creation of a European environmental bonus."
"In short, Europe must act and must not fail to respond."
"It must act and not be silent and take no action."
"We must act and act intelligently to support this transformation."
"(RO) We are living in a world where we have gone from getting around using one horse per person to getting around with tens or hundreds of horse power."
"4- and 5-seater cars are carrying just one person more than 75% of the time."
"They have been using 7.5 litres of fuel per 100 kilometres over 100 years.."
"The major problems facing mankind are problems relating to behaviour and pollution."
"We therefore need to think about and use cars differently."
"They need to be much smaller, quite safe, green, using a few litres per 100 kilometres and at prices which will allow human behaviour to be controlled in the future."
"(NL) Madam President, with all due criticism of the car industry and of the way the Commission has operated, we have no choice but to devote attention to the car industry because, like housing construction, it is facing a dramatic decline."
"All the alarm bells are ringing, so we must act on time, in the short term and in a targeted manner."
"I should like to stress three things: this should involve not only the major car manufacturers, but also suppliers and financing companies."
"The restructuring exercise should focus on cleaner, more economical cars, and certain aspects will need to be coordinated at European level."
"We must discourage Member States from flying solo, which could exacerbate the problems in neighbouring countries."
"This is particularly important to suppliers, because they work across borders."
"They operate within the internal market and should be able to enjoy the measures to the same extent, and not just at national level."
"This level playing field should be closely monitored by the European Commission."
"As such, I support the role which the Directorate-General for Competition has been assigned in this connection."
"(FR) Madam President, having paid to save the banks, we now have to save the automobile industry and once again, of course, with public funds."
"For more than ten years, however, we have been alerting the automobile industry of the consequences of CO2 emissions on public health."
"For more than ten years, we have been calling for the industry to build clean cars."
"For more than ten years, it has turned a deaf ear and has resisted with the powerful automobile lobby."
"It has been holding back any development."
"Recently, Commissioner, and you are in a position to know this, in this Parliament it opposed 'CARS 21' in order not to reduce emissions below 130 grams."
"Yet, after making considerable profits, which were not reinvested in industrial restructuring, the financial crisis has become a good excuse to ask for public aid and sack workers left, right and centre."
"Are consumers going to be fooled yet again?"
"In fact, consumers are going to have to pay so that they can obtain a clean car on the market, with no guarantee that it will be cheaper, just as in the present situation."
"It is therefore elsewhere that the automobile industry must be steered to avoid future bankruptcies because we must prepare for the post-car era."
"(DE) Madam President, first of all, we would observe that the markets in Europe that have been less subject to collapse have a clear regulatory environment in respect of legislation on the taxation of CO2 and a clear regulatory environment in respect of what is expected of car makers."
"Mr Jouyet, if your Presidency were to succeed in obliging the Member States to create clear regulatory environments as quickly as possible, even the consumer would regain confidence."
"That would be the best possible aid for the motor industry."
"There is something else we should do."
"We should not, at this point, be talking about subsidies amounting to billions whilst, at the same time, threatening the motor industry with fines amounting to billions if targets are not met."
"That makes no sense."
"It provides a massive amount of uncertainty and makes vehicles more expensive for consumers."
"We need to proceed differently, put a vision in place and announce that, by the end of the 2020s, 20, 25 or 30% of cars should be emission-free."
"That would spark innovation and bring it to the fore, whilst also providing clarity to consumers about the future strategy of the motor industry in Europe."
"(ES) Madam President, in the current crisis situation, the laudable efforts of the French Presidency and the Industry Commissioner, Mr Verheugen, should be congratulated."
"However, we need more, and urgently."
"We also need to hear the Industry and Competition Commissioners speaking in harmony."
"The car industry, which means manufacturers, support industry, distributors and finance companies, needs an urgent and audacious multifaceted aid plan."
"People will not understand modesty and reticence when decisions are made about the aid needed to support the car industry, given its direct, mass and high-quality employment, particularly in comparison to the diligence shown in helping the financial sector, in which the most serious errors have been judged with benevolence."
"The Opel workers at Figueruelas in Zaragoza, who have assisted and supported the future of their company in Spain and Germany, will not understand, nor will the government of Aragón or the Spanish government which are utilising all their investment resources and hoping for cooperation and leadership from the European Union."
"We need a rapid and audacious plan which will quickly help to replace the European car fleet with safer and cleaner vehicles."
"We need a European 'Plan Renove' or renewal scheme, as from December, which will encourage everything from direct investment to consumption."
"European car manufacturers, and also the support industry, distributors and finance companies, also need aid and guarantees."
"A quick, straightforward and logical agreement on the vehicles and emissions issue would also be helpful."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Juncker, President of the Eurogroup and Prime Minister of Luxembourg, has stated that we need a European strategy to save the car industry in response to the rescue plan announced by the United States."
"I am fully in agreement with what has been said and I hope that it will happen."
"At the next meeting of ministers of finance of the Member States, the European Investment Bank will propose an increase in loan volumes of 20 and 30% in 2009 and 2010, amounting to EUR 10-15 billion per year for the car industry, and this decision is extremely timely."
"Some Member States have already taken independent action: the German government, for example, submitted early in the month an aid plan targeting the economy, with the idea of generating new investment amounting to EUR 50 billion over the next year."
"Among the key sectors involved is the car industry."
"I hope that the European Commission will do the same, acting as a body."
"Aid to the sector should be invested within the European Union, and therefore should go to firms that are not relocating their production operations."
"Every decision to grant aid to firms is extremely welcome, given the circumstances, and its main goal should be to shore up employment and stimulate investment within Europe."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I actually agree with the comments made by Mrs Harms."
"The support that is needed for the car industry indeed represents failing industrial policy."
"For years, there has been talk about the need to prepare the car industry for the 21st century, which ultimately did not happen."
"Again and again, the car industry has turned a deaf ear to the appeals for cleaner and more economical cars."
"Ultimately, we have nothing to show for it."
"The car industry has done nothing in the way of innovation to produce cars with less CO2 emissions, and still there is the lobby to ease the CO2 requirements on the car industry, which is a crying shame."
"The question is: where do we go from here?"
"I think that we can continue to support the car industry, but that this must be coupled with very strict requirements, and that real support should be given only to electrical cars, an entire programme to make the electrification of the car industry possible and, of course, to the retraining of workers."
"After all, it is very important that the workers in the car industry should have a future."
"They should never be forgotten."
"Madam President, I would like to thank all the speakers."
"It is a very rich debate on an important matter and I share, like the Presidency, the feeling that has been expressed by the majority of you, namely that it is absolutely vital that we assume full responsibility to face up to this exceptional situation that is hitting a key industry: the figures are, as you pointed out, 12 million jobs in the European Union and an industry hit by the financial crisis, due to the level of consumer credit which is the hallmark of this industry."
"Moreover, it is an industry that has to face up to unparalleled ecological challenges."
"Falling behind schedule is one thing, not making up the lost time is another, just when we are also committed to adopting the energy and climate change package, which is one of the great challenges the European Union has to face."
"This is, therefore, an exceptional situation and the European response, for the Presidency, must be equal to these challenges."
"This response must take into account three factors."
"Firstly, what our third-country partners are doing."
"We must retain the competitiveness of this European industry."
"Secondly, we must retain the major objectives of the European Union: the Commission's proposals must promote the achievement of the energy and climate change package objectives with which you are familiar."
"Concerning vehicle CO2 emissions, I believe we are close to an agreement and that it is within reach in the context of the procedures involving your Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Thirdly, we must also respect the integrity of the internal market."
"Transparency and equal treatment and coordination are essential but this does not in any way preclude, when there are circumstances such as the ones we are experiencing at present, temporary targeted support, determined and granted on the basis of commitments also undertaken by the automobile industry."
"I note the lines of action proposed by Commissioner Verheugen which I consider to be good initiatives and which the Presidency supports, either through loans from the European Investment Bank for the most significant ecological investments, or through tax incentives to make the demand for cars more compatible with environmental requirements, to renew cars on the road that are ageing and therefore move further away from the environmental requirements, to reduce the cost of motor vehicles, which also seems to be an important objective, and to move more in the direction of vehicles that are more economical."
"Finally, I consider that when facing crisis situations, developing public guarantees is also important in this sector."
"I also think that we need to have incentives to develop training and, in certain cases, retraining, because in the coming weeks and in the first few months of 2009, we can, unfortunately, expect to see an even more difficult situation."
"Everything proposed by Commissioner Verheugen seems to me to be heading in the right direction and we shall support him."
"It is now a question of time, we must act fast and I also approve the idea expressed by Mr Goebbels of a stable and offensive European framework so as to retain the competitiveness of this vital industry."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is a shame that Mrs Harms is no longer present."
"After such an unorthodox attack - one which was pushing the limits of defamation - it would have been right to have allowed me the opportunity to answer her."
"I will now do so in writing."
"However, on behalf of the Commission, I reject in the most definite possible terms Mrs Harms's claims in both style and substance."
"(Applause)"
"That is unacceptable."
"On the matter itself, the European motor industry is not on a medical drip."
"Some of the interventions gave the impression that what we are dealing with here is a sector that is either dependent on or is calling for subsidies."
"No subsidies are paid to the European motor industry, nor has it asked for any."
"Our entire industrial policy is, of course, based on the idea that we want to be independent of subsidies."
"The only instrument available is low-interest credit from the European Investment Bank."
"Let me make it clear to everyone, however, exactly what that means - these credits are at interest rates that are perhaps around 1% below standard market rates."
"This is necessary in order to be able to finance the investments which, for example, you, as the European legislator, demand from the car makers, namely investments in modern, environmentally friendly technologies."
"That is why the European Investment Bank does this, and not only for the European motor industry."
"The impression has been given in this Chamber that the motor industry is the only European sector able to make use of this credit facility from the European Investment Bank."
"No, that is not the case."
"It crosses all sectors and is thus not at all specific to the motor industry."
"I would ask you all urgently to avoid giving out the impression in this House that the European motor industry is a destitute sector on a state-supplied drip."
"The industry is not on a drip, nor does it need to be, because in its technical position and its competitiveness, it is quite clearly the best-performing motor industry in the world."
"I am absolutely convinced that it will continue to be so."
"We have been working for years - with the industry and with science - on developing the modern technologies of the future."
"In the context of the Seventh Framework Programme, we are spending a lot of money on this, and have been for a number of years."
"We are working intensively to ensure that the framework conditions for this industry are stable."
"It was the first industrial sector for which we developed a sectoral policy of this nature at all, and the reason for this was precisely the fact that we saw future problems facing this sector in good time."
"On the case of Opel, I would like to reiterate: it is an absolutely exceptional, extraordinary situation that has nothing to do with the business policy of the company itself."
"This is exclusively the consequence of problems that arose in the United States of America which have an impact on Europe and for which we need to find an answer."
"One final point - Mr Groote spoke about a subject of special interest to him, namely the 'Volkswagen Law'."
"I am not of the belief that it would be a good idea to launch a European initiative with the aim of setting up similar statutory regulations for all European car makers."
"Hardly anyone else would agree with this idea, either."
"To my knowledge, Mr Groote, the Commission has not changed its view on this matter."
"Decisions can be expected soon, however."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"The world's car industry has got into difficulties, though that is not true for all plants."
"Porsche has found a new way of making money, and that is to take up options to buy shares in Volkswagen."
"That, however, is not a solution to VW's problems or those of other car factories."
"The bank crisis has brought with it a car crisis: in a deflating economy, people cannot afford to buy new cars or the fuel to put in them."
"The European Investment Bank wants to rescue the car industry in the name of the EU, but we need to think again about whether the world is going to need all the capacity that is used today for producing cars."
"If EIB loans went towards new energy and environmental technology, that would meet the world's real needs at the present time more successfully."
"The loose money which consumers used to buy new cars in recent years has gone, and it is not coming back."
"The car manufacturing industry is one of the driving forces of the European economy."
"Approximately 300 000 cars and 300 000 goods and passenger vehicles are produced in Europe every year."
"Road transport is responsible for 72% of all emissions generated by transport, but the time has now come for us to reaffirm the importance of the car manufacturing industry from an economic and social perspective."
"The financial crises and economic recession are having a severe impact on the car industry, which guarantees, both directly and indirectly, more than 15 million jobs."
"2012 will be a crucial year for Europe's car manufacturing industry as new requirements will be introduced with regard to fuel quality, pollutant emission restrictions, type certification and the safety of road users."
"In order to make our road traffic greener, the Union intends to introduce bonuses for greener vehicles and penalise those which cause more pollution."
"The 'Climate Change' package will therefore become one of the means aimed at boosting demand for greener, safer vehicles."
"Social Europe is based on economic development and, in an equal measure, on social values."
"The European car industry must be supported to respond to the new challenges so that existing jobs can be preserved and it can remain competitive."

"Formal sitting - Sir Jonathan Sacks"
"(DE) Chief Rabbi Sacks, Lady Sacks, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and pleasure to welcome the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, and his wife, to the European Parliament in Strasbourg at this formal session as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue 2008."
"A very warm welcome to the European Parliament, Sir Jonathan!"
"(Applause)"
"As our first guest in this year of intercultural dialogue, the Grand Mufti of Syria, Sheikh Ahmad Badr Al-Din Hassoun, made a speech in our plenary session."
"As the year went on, we also had the opportunity to listen to an address by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I. With your speech today, Chief Rabbi, we will have heard from representatives of Judaism, Christianity and Islam."
"Each of these religions has produced its own special contribution to shaping what today's European society has become and what distinguishes it."
"The same is true of humanism and enlightenment."
"Even if we live in secular societies in which there is a clear separation of church and state, it is fitting to duly recognise the positive role that organised religion plays in our societies."
"This relates not only to the physical contribution to areas such as training, health and social services, but also to the same extent to the development of our ethical consciousness and to the shaping of our values."
"The European Union is a community of values and the most fundamental of these is the inherent dignity of every human being."
"Chief Rabbi, you are well known as a great author and professor, an unsurpassable man of learning and one of the world's leading representatives of the Jewish faith."
"You have often written and spoken about the danger that a rejuvenation of anti-Semitism poses to our societies."
"Last week, at the European Parliament in Brussels, we held a very special commemoration, which we arranged jointly with the European Jewish Congress, in order to remember the 70th anniversary of the Night of Broken Glass."
"On that occasion, I pointed out that we in the European Union bear a responsibility and a duty to resist, absolutely without exception and without appeasement, all forms of extremism, racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism and to defend democracy, the protection of human rights and human dignity across the globe."
"Chief Rabbi, in your book The Dignity of Difference - and on this point I will close - which was written a year after the terrible events of 11 September 2001, you tackled one of the most fundamental questions of our day, namely: can we all live together in peace and, if so, how?"
"It is now with great pleasure and honour that I ask the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth to address us."
"(Applause)"
"Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth. - Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, I thank you for the privilege of addressing you today, and I thank you even more for undertaking this vital initiative of intercultural dialogue."
"I salute you all, but in particular your visionary, wise and deeply humane President, Hans-Gert Pöttering."
"May I - in what I hope will be today my only breach of the separation between church and state, religion and politics - give my prayer and my blessing that God will bless all of you and all you do. Thank you."
"I speak as a Jew from within the oldest continuous cultural presence in Europe."
"I want to begin by reminding us that European civilisation was born 2 000 years ago in a dialogue, a dialogue between the two greatest cultures of antiquity: Ancient Greece and Biblical Israel - Athens and Jerusalem."
"They were brought together by Christianity, whose religion came from Israel but whose sacred texts were written in Greek, and that was the founding dialogue of Europe."
"And some of the greatest moments in European history in the intervening 2 000 years were the result of dialogue."
"I will mention just three."
"The first took place between the 10th and 13th centuries in al-Andalus, in the great cultural movement initiated by the Umayyads in Spain."
"It began with an Islamic dialogue on the part of thinkers like Averroës with the philosophical heritage of Plato and Aristotle."
"The Islamic dialogue inspired Jewish thinkers like Moses Maimonides, and the Jewish dialogue inspired Christian thinkers, most famously Aquinas."
"The second great moment of intercultural dialogue took place at the beginning of the Italian Renaissance when a young Christian intellectual, Pico della Mirandola, travelled to Padua, where he met a Jewish scholar, Rabbi Elijah Delmedigo, who taught him the Hebrew Bible, the Talmud and Kabbalah in their original languages."
"Out of that dialogue came the most famous statement of Renaissance values: Pico's Oration on Human Dignity."
"The third and most poignant of them all has been the dialogue between Christians and Jews after the Holocaust, inspired by Martin Buber's philosophy of dialogue and by Vatican II and Nostra Aetate."
"The result has been that, after almost 2 000 years of estrangement and tragedy, today Jews and Christians meet in mutual respect as friends."
"But I want to say more than this."
"As I read the Hebrew Bible, I hear from the very beginning God's call to dialogue."
"I want to draw attention to two passages."
"I am not quite sure how this will go down in translation, so I hope anyone who is listening to me in translation will get it."
"I want to draw attention to two passages in the opening chapters of the Bible whose meaning has been lost in translation for 2 000 years."
"The first occurs when God sees the first man isolated and alone and He creates woman."
"And man, seeing woman for the first time, utters the first poem in the Bible: 'Now I have found bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh."
"She shall be called Aisha, woman, for she was taken from Aish, man'."
"Now this sounds like a very simple poem."
"It even sounds rather condescending, as if the man was the first creation and women were a mere afterthought."
"However, the real meaning lies in the fact that biblical Hebrew has two words for man, not one."
"One is Adam, and the other is Aish."
"This verse that I just quoted to you is the first time the word 'Aish' appears in the Bible."
"Listen again."
"'She shall be called Aisha, because she was taken from Aish'."
"In other words, the man has to pronounce the name of his wife before he even knows his own name."
"I have to say 'you' before I can say 'I'."
"I have to acknowledge the other, before I can truly understand myself."
"(Loud applause)"
"That is the first point the Bible makes: identity is dialogical."
"The second occurs soon after, in the first great tragedy that overcomes the first human children Cain and Abel."
"We expect brotherly love."
"Instead there is sibling rivalry and then murder, fratricide."
"And at the heart of this story in Genesis, Chapter IV, is a verse that is impossible to translate and in every English Bible I have ever read the verse is not translated, it is paraphrased."
"I am going to translate it literally and you will see why no one translates it that way."
"Literally the Hebrew means as follows: 'And Cain said to Abel, and it came to pass when they were out in the field that Cain rose up against Abel and killed him.'"
"You can see immediately why it cannot be translated because it says 'and Cain said' but it does not say what he said."
"The sentence is ungrammatical."
"The syntax is fractured."
"And the question is, why?"
"The answer is clear: the Bible is signalling in the most dramatic way, in a broken sentence, how the conversation broke down."
"The dialogue failed."
"And what do we read immediately afterwards?"
"'And Cain rose up against his brother and killed him'."
"Or to put it simply: where words end, violence begins."
"Dialogue is the only way to defeat the worst angels of our nature."
"(Loud applause)"
"Dialogue therefore testifies to the double aspect of all human relationships, whether they are between individuals or between countries or cultures or creeds."
"Our commonalities, on the one hand, and our differences on the other."
"What we hold in common and what is uniquely ours."
"Let me put it as simply as I can."
"If we were completely different, we could not communicate, but if we were totally the same, we would have nothing to say."
"(Applause)"
"And that is all I have to say about dialogue, and yet I want to add that dialogue may not be quite enough."
"You see, between the late 18th century and 1933, there was dialogue between Jews and Germans, just as there was dialogue and even friendship between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda, or between Serbs and Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo."
"Dialogue brings us together, but it cannot always keep us together when other forces are driving us apart."
"Therefore, I want to add one other word, which played a significant part in healing fragmented societies."
"The word is 'covenant'."
"It played a major role in European politics in the 16th and 17th centuries in Switzerland, in Holland, in Scotland and in England."
"Covenant has been part of American culture from the very beginning to today, from the Mayflower Compact in 1620, to John Winthrop's speech aboard the Arabella in 1631, all the way through to the present."
"I do not know what Barack Obama will say when he makes his inaugural speech but he will either mention or allude to the concept of covenant."
"Covenant is, of course, a key word of the Hebrew Bible for a simple reason: biblical Israel was formed out of 12 different tribes, each of which had insisted on retaining its distinct identity."
"What is a covenant?"
"A covenant is not a contract."
"A contract is made for a limited period, for a specific purpose, between two or more parties, each seeking their own benefit."
"A covenant is made open-endedly by two or more parties who come together in a bond of loyalty and trust to achieve together what none can achieve alone."
"A contract is like a deal; a covenant is like a marriage."
"Contracts belong to the market and to the state, to economics and politics, both of which are arenas of competition."
"Covenants belong to families, communities, charities, which are arenas of cooperation."
"A contract is between me and you - separate selves - but a covenant is about us - collective belonging."
"A contract is about interests; a covenant is about identity."
"And hence the vital distinction, not made clearly enough in European politics, between a social contract and a social covenant: a social contract creates a state; a social covenant creates a society."
"(Applause)"
"You can have a society without a state - that has happened at times in history - but can you have a state without a society, without anything to hold people together?"
"I do not know."
"You can hold people together in many different ways: by force, by fear, by suppressing cultural difference, by expecting everyone to conform."
"But when you choose to respect the integrity of many cultures, when you honour what I call - as the President reminded us - the dignity of difference, when you honour that, then to create a society you need a covenant."
"Covenant restores the language of cooperation to a world of competition."
"It focuses on responsibilities, not just on rights."
"Rights are essential, but rights create conflicts that rights cannot resolve: the right to life against the right to choose; my right to freedom against your right to respect."
"Rights without responsibilities are the subprime mortgages of the moral world."
"(Loud applause)"
"What covenant does is to get us to think about reciprocity."
"Covenant says to each of us: we must respect others if we expect others to respect us; we must honour the freedom of others if they are to honour ours."
"Europe needs a new covenant and the time to begin it is now."
"(Applause)"
"Now, in the midst of financial crisis and economic recession, because in bad times people are aware that we all share a fate."
"The Prophet Isaiah foresaw a day when the lion and the lamb would live together."
"It has not happened yet."
"Although there was a zoo where a lion and a lamb lived together in the same cage and a visitor asked the zookeeper: 'How do you manage that?'."
"The zookeeper said: 'Easy, you just need a new lamb every day!'."
"(Laughter)"
"But there was a time when the lion and the lamb did live together."
"Where was that?"
"In Noah's Ark."
"And why was that?"
"It was not because they had reached Utopia but because they knew that otherwise they would both drown."
"Friends, last Thursday - six days ago - the Archbishop of Canterbury and I led a mission of the leaders of all the faiths in Britain, leaders of the Muslim community, the Hindus, the Sikhs, the Buddhists, the Jains, the Zoroastrians and the Baha'i, and together we travelled and spent a day in Auschwitz."
"There we wept together, and there we prayed together, knowing what happens when we fail to honour the humanity of those not like us."
"God has given us many languages and many cultures, but only one world in which to live together, and it is getting smaller every day."
"May we, the countries and the cultures of Europe, in all our glorious diversity, together write a new European covenant of hope."
"(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation.)"
"Sir Jonathan, on behalf of the European Parliament, I am honoured to thank you for your important message."
"I would like to thank you for your great contribution to the intercultural dialogue."
"You spoke about the mutual respect and acknowledgement of others."
"I think this is what we have learnt from our European history."
"You said that what unites us is much more than that which divides us."
"This is the principle - and you finished with this - of our European engagement for a strong, democratic European Union which is based on the dignity of each human being."
"Sir Jonathan, thank you for your great message."
"All the best to you, the religion you represent and the peaceful living together of all religions on our continent and in the world. Thank you, Sir Jonathan."

"Voting time (continuation)"
"We now continue with the vote."
"(For the results and other details on the vote: see Minutes.)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Kauppi for her report on the electronic company register, which I fully support."
"It is a brilliant idea and an excellent report, and Parliament stands united in support of its implementation."
"I hope we will have electronic company registers in the Member States as soon as possible, as well as a Europe-wide electronic platform that contains all information companies are required to disclose."
"The proposals, if implemented, would mean less bureaucracy, more transparency, a diminished administrative burden, lower costs for companies and, as a result, enhanced competitiveness of European companies."
"(LT) I voted for the report on the Regulation of European Statistics prepared by Andreas Schwab."
"The reason I voted for it is the fact that the content of the new regulation is really important, significantly improving the existing regulation."
"I have in mind the definition of the European Statistical System, its place in Community law."
"The regulation also sets out the functions of national statistics institutions in the European Statistical System in solving matters of statistical confidentiality and statistical quality."
"This is undoubtedly a step forward compared to the current situation and the regulation now in force."
"In fact, the European Commission's proposal to split the European Statistical System Committee into two parts seems controversial to me and the rapporteur's position of not separating functions seems more acceptable and worth supporting."
"However, I trust that, in future, if the European Parliament, Council and Commission work together, we will overcome these disagreements."
"(DE) Mr President, I have an explanation of vote to make on the report in respect of modulation."
"In the most recent agricultural reform, it was decided that farmers would have planning certainty until 2013."
"For that reason, I was opposed to implementing modulation on a scale that would result in farmers losing larger amounts."
"I am pleased with the result and would like to thank all my fellow Members who voted in favour of raising the allowance from EUR 5 000 to EUR 10 000, meaning that less modulation funding is taken away from small businesses."
"If we, in politics, talk of planning certainty, this is something we should also grant to the farmers."
"I am therefore pleased about the result of today's report on modulation and hope that the Council accepts our results."
"(PL) Mr President, today's vote ended almost twelve months of work on the preparation of our opinion on the operation of the common agricultural policy."
"It is important for the changes we have made to contribute to simplifying this policy."
"At the same time, we should retain its Community nature and ensure equal conditions of competition."
"I hope that EU agriculture ministers will read the opinion and accept our proposals."
"What I have in mind in particular are proposals dealing with the simplification of cross-compliance requirements, including postponement until 2013 of the implementation of requirements relating to the area of animal welfare, area C, by new Member States."
"Regrettably, many solutions have been designed in a way which does not take into account the situation or the model of agriculture existing in new Member States."
"We are now starting to discuss the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013 and to review the financial perspective."
"Much work remains ahead of us."
"(GA) Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation of the very positive vote that took place here today in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, and I would also like to welcome the policies that were presented, such as providing fruit and vegetables to schools."
"However, in relation to the policy itself, I would like to draw attention once more to the obligatory modulation recommended by the Commission and to state that I am totally against it."
"The policy must be flexible and the Member States must be permitted to raise or lower that modulation as they wish."
"In my opinion, the EUR 5 000 threshold is too low."
"It should be raised to EUR 10 000 to protect and support farmers on low incomes that are suffering already - I do not think money should be taken from them for obligatory modulation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just wanted to speak to state publicly the reasons for my final vote against the Santos report 0401 and 02."
"The report is merely dependent on the health check on the common agricultural policy, which takes no account of the changed world conditions."
"We are discussing the details without seeing the main problem."
"The CAP that we are using the health check to verify was created to reduce agricultural production in order to promote environmental protection, because those were the conditions under which it was established."
"Today, we all know that the economic conditions have changed drastically, but the CAP remains more or less the same and all we are discussing is whether the first or the second option is better, whether we need less or more, this or that measure, when they have now become inadequate to meet the challenges of the future."
"I cannot accept this endless dealing with small, specific interests, ignoring the general good."
"I am convinced that the prime victim of this lack of courage is agriculture itself."
"In order to provoke dialogue and a debate, I voted against this report;"
"I am leaving on my website the technical details that cannot be included in a one-minute speech, and my specific reasons will be published there."
"(FR) Mr President, the Hungarian Members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament voted in favour of the reports by Mr Capoulas Santos because these reports are much more positive for new Member States, and for Hungary as well."
"Compulsory modulation and gradual modulation are less brutal than in the Commission's proposal."
"I regret there was not a vote in favour of the ALDE amendment regarding compulsory modulation."
"It is regrettable but, in spite of that, it is a good report."
"With regard to the second report, Amendment 67 was proposed by the Socialist Group."
"With reference to the intervention system, it is very important not to intervene on the basis of tendering procedures."
"Maintaining the current system is very positive."
"This is why we voted in favour."
"Mr President, I compliment Mr Capoulas Santos on his very complex work."
"The Fine Gael delegation supported these reports with caveats."
"On the issue of milk quotas, we voted for greater flexibility and a higher percentage increase in quotas, giving farmers the opportunity to produce milk should they wish."
"We regret that this was not the view of the plenary and that we are now back with the Commission's proposal."
"Secondly, on modulation, we are concerned about the transferring of funds from pillar 1 to pillar 2 because it takes income from farmers to be used in schemes which require cofinancing by Member States, and this is something that may not be guaranteed into the future."
"The raising of the franchise to EUR 10 000, on which Parliament has voted in favour, is welcome."
"I would like to clarify that our vote on Recital 6 - Amendments 190 and 226 - should read '+' (in favour)."
"I hope that the Council will assist the ailing sheep sector in its deliberations of tomorrow and today."
"(BG) I would like to draw your attention to proposed amendment 54 tabled by Mr Deß and a group of other MEPs."
"If this amendment was adopted, it would result in an appalling double standard between the old and the new Member States, because by increasing the quota, the new Member States would need to increase it only if the financial year allowed it."
"I see that Mr Deß is still in the auditorium - so perhaps he would be able to explain to me whether the financial year allows the quota for the new Member States to be increased."
"Thankfully, this amendment was not adopted but rejected by this House, which has allowed me to vote for the entire report, and I am very happy that Parliament has not allowed two categories of Member State to be created in respect of increased milk quotas."
"(DE) Mr President, the report on the milk quota argues for milk quotas to be raised."
"Along with all my CSU colleagues, I voted against all the amendments in which quota increases are called for."
"The milk quota due to apply until 31 March 2015 is designed to stabilise European milk markets."
"There is currently a surplus on European milk markets."
"This has put serious pressure on milk prices."
"Any further increase in the quota will intensify the fall in prices faced by milk producers."
"Many farmers' livelihoods would then be in jeopardy."
"We do not need an increase in the quota but rather a system that reacts flexibly to the situation in the market."
"If, however, a majority here in Parliament and in the Council decides to phase out milk quotas by 2015, a milk fund will be necessary in order to ensure the continued survival of milk production in the disadvantaged areas and grassland areas in future."
"Mr President, if I were to set out to design the most expensive, wasteful, corrupt, immoral, bureaucratic system of farm support that I could, I am not sure that I would have come up with anything as ingenious as the common agricultural policy, a system that penalises us, as taxpayers, to subsidise the production of food for which there is no market and then penalises us again, as consumers, to sustain prices for it."
"It often penalises us a third time, as taxpayers, to destroy the food which could not be sold."
"In the meantime, it causes environmental destruction because output-based subsidies encourage the felling of hedgerows and the use of pesticides and unfriendly fertilisers and, of course, causes terrible starvation in Africa."
"This is particularly harmful, I have to say, for a country such as yours and mine, which is a food importer with a relatively efficient agrarian sector, and which is therefore penalised both positively and negatively, paying more into the system and getting less out of it than other EU Member States."
"Almost anything we did would be better than the common agricultural policy, be it direct support or any other system."
"And in case you thought I had forgotten to say it, it is high time we put the Lisbon Treaty to a referendum."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"(DE) Mr President, I have voted in favour of the Capoulas Santos report and of Amendment 186, which recommends a franchise of EUR 10 000 for the modulation."
"This concerns small-scale agriculture in Europe."
"The modulation process must be applied in moderation."
"Small farms in Europe need the support of the EU, so that they can continue to exist within the EU's wage structure."
"We want healthy food to be produced in Europe and to be available at reasonable prices."
"We also want the countryside to be managed."
"If we really do want all of this, then we must give our farmers support, so that we can continue to produce healthy food in future in Europe, which is an area with one of the most favourable climates in the world."
"This is why I have voted in favour of the Capoulas Santos report."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the report prepared by Capoulas Santos on the European rural development fund."
"We created this programme just two years ago and it actually came into operation just last year."
"The applicants have begun to draw up their projects and to learn the rules of the fund."
"Now, after just one year, we are changing these rules."
"I cannot support such a step, because it will bring only losses and delays in financing projects needed by rural areas."
"Such a frequent change of rules cannot bring any benefit and therefore I have voted against it."
"(PL) Mr President, this is a very important subject."
"Assessment of the common agricultural policy shows that it will make sense in the future if it is based on fair principles."
"The common agricultural policy should, above all, ensure food security for Europe, self-sufficiency and production of food for export, economic security for farming families, profitability of agricultural production, equal subsidies for farmers from old and new Member States, safety of the environment, preservation of biodiversity, putting a stop to the cultivation and farming of genetically modified organisms throughout the whole of the European Union, developing rural areas, ensuring the advancement of the most deprived regions, protection of cultural heritage and preservation of traditional culture, and equal access for inhabitants of rural areas to education, culture and technical developments."
"These goals can be achieved only if we learn the right lessons from our existing experience and reach for courageous solutions."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. -?"
"(LT) The European Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 recognises the necessity to improve the quality, ability to compare and accessibility of data on health conditions and disorders linked to the environment by using the Community statistical programme."
"I believe that this is a very important regulation."
"We must know our society's perception of health, its susceptibility to different illnesses."
"This regulation establishes a joint system for organising Community statistics on society's health and workers' health and safety."
"It is very important that the data is collected in the European Union on citizens' perception of health, physical and mental activities and disability, about cases of illnesses which are increasing or decreasing, about injuries, damage done by alcohol and drugs, lifestyle and the accessibility of health care institutions."
"Statistics will have to include information essential for Community actions in the area of society's health, aimed at supporting national strategies which are developing high quality and stable health care accessible to all."
"This regulation establishes a common framework for a systematic production of Community statistics in public health and health and safety at work."
"At the moment, statistical information on public health and health and safety at work is collected mainly on a voluntary basis."
"The adoption of this regulation will formalise the current 'gentlemen's agreement' and guarantee the continuity of data collection as well as the quality and comparability of data."
"At first reading in 2007, the European Parliament adopted 12 amendments to the Commission proposal."
"Most of the amendments dealt with horizontal issues, like the inclusion of gender and age in the breakdown variables and the use of additional and complementary financing provided by certain Community programmes in the two areas covered by the regulation."
"Some amendments were adopted to the annexes dealing exclusively either with public health or health and safety at work, such as the collection of data on protection against pandemics and transmissible diseases."
"In subsequent negotiations with the Slovenian Presidency, almost all amendments adopted by the European Parliament were agreed to be incorporated in the common position."
"The Council also made some other changes to the text but, in broad terms, these changes were acceptable."
"This regulation establishes a common framework for a systematic production of Community statistics in public health and health and safety at work."
"The statistics should take the form of a harmonised and common data set and should be produced by Eurostat together with the national statistical institutes and other national authorities responsible for the provision of official statistics."
"At the moment, statistical information on public health and health and safety at work is collected mainly on a voluntary basis."
"I agree with the proposed regulation because it aims to consolidate the progress made in regular data collection in the two areas in question, by formalising the current informal agreement between the Member States, guaranteeing the continuity of data collection and establishing a regulatory framework for improving the quality and comparability of data through common methodologies."
"It will certainly ensure greater clarity in terms of planning, sustainability and stability of European requirements for statistics on public health and health and safety at work."
"in writing. - At present there are no harmonised standards with regard to Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work."
"The harmonisation of such statistics will hugely improve comparability and enhance policy development."
"The common position on the whole accepts the amendments forwarded by this House at first reading and accordingly I was able to support the Scheele report."
"The stress of modern working life with its new types of employment contracts, job uncertainty and poor work-life balance is leaving its mark."
"Statistics show that mental health problems are currently one of the main causes of an early exit from working life."
"Job uncertainty is, of course, accompanied by an increase in cases of bullying."
"Health problems, such as back pain, are also constantly growing."
"In addition, in recent years, the number of cases in which employees have been dismissed while on sick leave or following an accident at work has risen."
"We have many problems that we need to confront and we need statistical data in order to keep up with the latest developments."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of the Scheele report."
"It is obvious that we need Community statistics for public health and for health and safety at work in order to provide support for the strategies which are aimed at developing high-quality medical care, which is viable and accessible to all."
"Health and safety at work is an area which promotes the protection of workers' lives, integrity and health, and creates working conditions which will ensure their physical, psychological and social well-being."
"In order to do this, we need a coherent, sustained programme which will protect employees against the risks of accidents and work-related illnesses."
"I support this draft resolution because, at the moment, we do not have a harmonised and common data set capable of proving the quality and comparability of information from the statistical systems in each country."
"Community statistics on health should be adapted to the progress made and results achieved from the Community measures implemented in the area of public health."
"In today's vote, I voted to accept the recommendation on the Council's common position on the acceptance of the Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council concerning Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work."
"It is my view that our health promotion strategy should place a special emphasis on disease prevention and early diagnosis."
"This strategy will be effective if we provide people with appropriate health care and treatment facilities, and if we reduce differences in access to health care between European Union Member States."
"We will not be able to develop a joint health care strategy if the appropriate statistical institutions do not have the relevant data."
"Consequently, adopting the regulation will represent a step towards better coordination of Community action on health care statistics."
"Collecting information on pandemics and infectious diseases will undoubtedly contribute to their improved control."
"It should also be noted that at present, public health and health care statistics are collected only on a voluntary basis."
"This being the case, the regulation aims to formalise existing solutions and to ensure continuity of data collection."
"The unanimous vote of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety points to the importance and rightness of the report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Kauppi report."
"Companies throughout Europe should be able to operate in an environment free from excessive burdens."
"Nevertheless, Member States must be allowed to formulate their own requirements and the principle of subsidiarity should be respected."
"I am satisfied that the Kauppi report strikes the correct balance."
"I voted in favour of accepting the report on the Parliament and Council Directive concerning information disclosure and translation requirements, intended to reduce excessive administrative burden imposed on certain types of companies."
"The proposal has as its objective the elimination from national law of all additional information disclosure requirements which increase business costs."
"Under existing regulations, information must be entered in the commercial registers of Member States and published in national official gazettes."
"At present, at a time when commercial registers publish information on the Internet, publication in official gazettes does not, in most cases, create added value, simply exposing companies to high costs."
"The proposed changes give Member States flexibility in setting additional information disclosure requirements and ensure that companies will be relieved of additional, frequently unnecessary, payments."
"The task of statistics is to provide objective and quantitative data, which can be referred to in processes involving the formation of public opinion and decision making."
"EU and Member State statistics are a direct supporting measure when making political and administrative decisions."
"Hence, when harmonising EU statistical systems, we must take their importance into account."
"The scientific independence of statistical research in Europe must be ensured."
"In addition, the regulations should not contradict the principle of subsidiarity."
"I support the Commission's proposal on the Regulation on European Statistics, which is a legal basis for collecting statistical data at a European level and which reconsiders the legal system in force, according to which the organisation of statistics at a European level is regulated."
"Voting against a report that initially appears to be technical, since it relates to the generating of Community statistics, may appear absurd."
"Indeed it is not without interest to have such data to help in making decisions."
"However, in spite of the declared intentions, this new regulation leads to the generation of new convoluted statistics, an increase in the statistical burden on national institutes and businesses, whether in terms of red tape or financial costs, contrary to the commitments made on several occasions to simplify and reduce this load."
"Moreover, the Europe of Brussels shows on a daily basis what it thinks of the figures that it is supposed to use."
"I shall only take two examples."
"Firstly, the limited proposals to support the real economy, which is entering into recession, support which, in any case, will be subjected to the dogmatic primacy of sacrosanct competition, global free trade and the 'stupid' Stability and Growth Pact."
"Secondly, the denial of the inflation suffered by households since the introduction of euro coins and notes."
"The price for certain basic commodities has in fact doubled, or even tripled, in 6 years, while the ECB focuses on global and misleading aggregates, and calls for wage moderation."
"in writing. - The collection of data plays a vital role in policy development and decision making."
"The Commission's proposal in this area will give a firm legal status to data collection and I voted in favour of Mr Schwab's report."
"On the basis of the report by the Portuguese Member, Luis Manuel Capoulas Santos, I voted in favour of the legislative resolution amending the proposal for a Council regulation establishing common rules for direct support schemes in favour of farmers within the context of the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes in favour of farmers."
"To exclude any threat to supplies, in the context of balanced and sustainable land management, it is essential to affirm the concept of food safety."
"I welcome and support the requests to simplify the procedures."
"I support the Community's crisis management instruments."
"This vote confirms a favourable change in how agriculture is taken into account in Community policies."
"However, the problem of the future of farming has not been solved: this will be the electoral debate in 2009 and in the political negotiations that will open immediately following the elections."
"I confirm that I voted for the Capoulas Santos report, but I would like to point to two aspects that may become untenable for farmers in my country."
"The first relates to milk quotas: the one per cent rise, the product of the compromise reached, is really too small a step and is not enough to satisfy the farmers' legitimate demands."
"The other unsatisfactory area is the funding for tobacco."
"Although I am going against my political group's position here, I am firmly convinced that the aid ought to be extended."
"A cut in subsidies would, in reality, do nothing to combat smoking, but would have a negative impact on the protection of jobs in a sector with over 500 000 workers in the 27 Member States."
"I hope for an improvement in the proposal during the course of the steps that will follow today's adoption"
"in writing. - (NL) The CAP 'health check' is an extensive and important area."
"Whether we like it or not, we indicate the course which agricultural policy should take after 2013."
"Allow me to mention two aspects in this respect."
"Decoupled support allows for more market-oriented, and therefore more competitive and more innovative agriculture, but we should not veer the other way to a fully liberalised agricultural market."
"We should not throw away the umbrella the minute the sun appears."
"Intervention mechanisms, insurance cover and so on should be organised in such a way as not to distort the market, and should, at the same time, be a real safety net."
"The proposals to channel considerable amounts to the second pillar via modulation do not receive my support."
"It appears that the funds in the first pillar are spent more wisely than the rural development funds."
"Moreover, I foresee all kinds of cofinancing problems in relation to a level playing field."
"The June Movement has voted against Amendment 208 in the report, as the outbreak of infectious animal diseases is due to insufficient veterinary separation of the animals."
"The problems arise in connection with the commercial utilisation of animals."
"It is therefore farmers and their industry that bear the responsibility and the risk associated with the proper handling of the animals to avoid disease."
"A draft law on a common economic allocation of costs is a bad idea since, at the end of the day, it will mean that citizens will pay for something they are not responsible for."
"The aim of reforming CAP should be to improve policy so that rural life throughout Europe would be more sustainable on a social, economic and environmental level."
"The 'health check' measure is a mixture that contains some improvements but which fails in other ways to deal with the challenges ahead of us."
"Rural life, and farming in particular, is facing many threats at the present time."
"Young farmers have to leave the land while, at the same time, large landowners are remunerated for leaving valuable agricultural land uncultivated."
"Biodiversity is under threat as well."
"I agree that it should be possible to use the reserve funds for new farmers and for young farmers, and for categories in the areas under greatest disadvantage, such as sheep - which have an important role as regards the preservation of biodiversity."
"I also support the application for payments to farmers to be brought forward earlier in the year so that farmers would have increased stability."
"Our rural communities require stability to enable them to plan for the future."
"in writing. - While I supported the Santos report on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, I am not in favour of the amendment that passed on increasing modulation."
"It will result in extra funds being transferred from pillar 1 to pillar 2 taking income directly from farmers (particularly small farmers) in countries such as Ireland."
"Funds will go to schemes which require cofinancing by Member States - a source of funding that is uncertain and cannot be relied on."
"I chose to vote against the report as it was clearly a step in the wrong direction from the Commission's proposal in a number of areas."
"One example is the watering down of the changes to direct aid for rural development."
"The majority agreed to reduce direct aid by only 6% for 2009 and 2010."
"The Commission had proposed to reduce aid by 7% in 2009 and 9% in 2010."
"Personally, I would have liked to have seen greater cuts still."
"In addition, it raised the threshold at which direct aid is to be switched to rural development aid."
"Under the original proposal, this switchover would have applied to subsidies from EUR 5 000 per annum and upwards."
"The majority has now voted to increase that threshold to EUR 10 000."
"This has the consequence of reducing the proportion of passive agricultural aid converted into active aid for rural development."
"The money would be better spent on starting up businesses in rural areas rather than producing crops that already reap a good profit."
"Despite improvements made to this report, to which we contributed, not least with the adoption of our proposal to increase the modulation exemption from EUR 5 000 to EUR 10 000, in order to promote greater social justice in the payment of aid to farmers, we regret that other proposals were rejected, even though some received more than 200 votes in favour, such as support for sugar production in the Azores."
"We also regret that the proposal of simplified aid for farmers receiving sums of up to EUR 1 000 was not adopted, despite having received 175 votes in favour."
"This would have been a way of combating the lack of social sensitivity of the Commission proposal, by simplifying the process and cutting red tape, which was actually used as a pretext by the European Commission to propose that aid of less than EUR 250 per year should be ended."
"This may harm around 90 000 small Portuguese farmers."
"As a result, despite our final vote against the report, we continue to defend our proposals as we consider that these are the best way to support Portuguese farmers and our family-based agriculture."
"in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party had a number of serious concerns regarding this report that will perpetuate and increase distortions within the European Union and on a global level regarding agricultural production."
"In view of today's vote where a series of amendments were carried to reinforce and worsen this situation, I was unable, on balance, to vote in favour of either the amended proposal or the draft legislative resolution despite the fact that the report has other detailed elements I support."
"Despite agreeing with the need to revise the support schemes for farmers, I consider that the Commission's proposals go well beyond what is needed, thereby seriously impacting on the income of farmers who are the guardians of the European rural landscape and of crucial importance to our food sovereignty."
"In many ways, the Capoulas Santos report improves the Commission proposal, particularly by giving greater flexibility to Member States in terms of setting minimum thresholds for payments."
"I therefore voted in favour of the threshold of EUR 10 000/year for the application of modulation, which will favour many small and medium-sized farmers, and the non-application of higher modulation rates to cooperatives and other legal entities made up of several farmers who, taken in isolation, do not receive more than EUR 100 000, in order to avoid unfairly penalising farmers."
"Although the report is not ideal - for example it does not allow the redistributive effect of additional modulation - I am pleased with the final result of the vote in plenary which is why I voted in favour of the legislative resolution."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as usual, has chosen a different route from that chosen by the Commission."
"Instead of reforming the common agricultural policy, the committee wants to increase the subsidies and ensure that taxpayers increase their economic stakes."
"The June List absolutely wants to abolish the export refund on agricultural products and has voted in favour of those proposals that recommended this."
"We believe that the EU is doing great harm abroad by dumping agricultural products in poor countries without paying any attention to the social consequences."
"The June List wants to abolish the common agricultural policy and we would observe that it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU's agricultural policy."
"Otherwise, the EU would fall into the trap of protectionism and of heavy subsidies to all the various groups within the agricultural industry."
"Before the great budgetary turning point of 2013, which may signal the end of the CAP through creeping re-nationalisation, Member States are trying to reach agreement on a new reform of the CAP, subsequent to the covert one in 2003."
"The declared objective of the Commission is to adapt even further to the market by reducing direct subsidies for environmental and rural development policies."
"The reform, unfortunately, is not equal to the challenges facing Europe in the agricultural sphere: feeding nine billion people in 2050, occupying limited agricultural areas, the dependence on prices linked to speculation on agricultural raw materials, and so on."
"In this fluctuating and uncertain context, we must defend the exception made for agriculture at the WTO insofar as agriculture and the food processing industry are not businesses like any others, but non-transferable production resulting from the know-how and genius of generations of farmers."
"And what if the health check on the CAP were only the first step towards the complete liberalisation of the CAP, with no regulation and no safety net?"
"We must be vigilant and denounce any liberal drift on this issue, which does not mean failing to act."
"I am not happy with the result of the compromise of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but I am reasonably satisfied."
"We have been able to avert the most serious damage which would have been caused to our farmers as a result of the disastrous proposals put forward by the EU Commission, by ensuring that the direct payments are not reduced by 13% between 2009 and 2013."
"These direct payments, which are essential to our farmers, should only be reduced by 1% in 2009 and 2010 and 2% in 2011 and 2012 at the most."
"If this money finds its way into the milk fund, as we have proposed, for example, in order to pay grass premiums to milk producers, the cut in direct income will be less painful."
"The milk price is falling again, but not the production costs."
"For example, the price of fertiliser has risen by 40%."
"Unfortunately, the Commissioner is once again up in arms against the milk fund."
"Even if we do not cut these direct payments to farmers, which amount to up to EUR 5 000 or even up to EUR 10 000 per year, as is being demanded in the amendments which go beyond the compromise proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this will not have a major impact on farmers in Luxembourg, because only farms managed on a part-time basis fall below the EUR 10 000 threshold."
"The priority must be to keep the cuts as small as possible, otherwise there will be no future for full-time farmers in Luxembourg, which is unacceptable."
"in writing. - I support a 2% increase in milk quotas over four years as I believe the 2% will give the smoothest landing ahead of the abolition of the milk quota system in 2015."
"I voted against the report by Capoulas Santos on the new support scheme for farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy, because I consider that the sustainability of agriculture cannot be safeguarded at European level."
"The agricultural sector does indeed need to be financed in order to safeguard the sustainability of the sector and food security in Europe."
"However, financing should be provided from the Community budget and should not penalise small and medium-scale producers by adopting, for example, minimum aid limits."
"On the contrary, the criterion of personal work should be of prime importance for the payment of support and an upper limit on support per holding should be set."
"However, the crisis management system proposed by the Commission falls short."
"It would make more sense to create a public safety fund which is based on Community financing and which is designed to prevent crises and plant diseases and guarantee a minimum income for farmers."
"Finally, the report contains no proposal for setting up mechanisms to address climate change, which is directly affecting European farmers."
"in writing. - Conservative MEPs voted against this report as it is a step in the wrong direction."
"We consider it to be essential that the decoupling process initiated in the 2003 Reform be extended to all sectors so as to allow farmers to produce what the market demands and achieve a genuine level playing field."
"This report resists decoupling and even tries to reverse decisions already taken, notably the inclusion of the tobacco regime in the Single Farm Payment."
"The report would see production-linked tobacco subsidies extended until 2012 and clearly we cannot accept this."
"The report also allows too much flexibility in the use of Article 68 which we fear will distort the market, will allow coupled payments in through the back door and may be challenged at the WTO."
"Finally, the exemption of the first EUR 10 000 from modulation, combined with a very low level of compulsory EU modulation, will simply not generate sufficient revenue for a strong rural development policy and will hit UK farmers disproportionately."
"The debate on the common agricultural policy (CAP) health check offered an excellent opportunity to launch an in-depth discussion of its reform, which must take place in 2013."
"To successfully achieve this, we need to proceed with caution, placing the emphasis on both competitiveness and also on the environmental and social dimensions, rural development and food security."
"The agreement reached between the main political groups, which was really down to the determination of the rapporteur, Mr Capoulas Santos, already provides some solutions and approaches which it is hoped that the Council will take on board."
"Although this is not currently an area of codecision, Parliament has worked in this spirit and this fact should be utilised by the governments."
"I voted in favour of the package because of the importance of the result achieved in terms of the Community contribution to insurance premiums and the retention of lower subsidies which are extremely important in countries such as Portugal."
"This is also the case with the balanced solution for modulation in rural development support."
"In the case of milk quotas, regrettably we have not achieved a balance avoiding potential harm to producers in regions such as the north and centre of Portugal and the Azores."
"I am voting in favour of the rejection of this report and in favour of the report being referred back to the committee since it has further weakened the reforms put forward by the Commission, which were already too small in scale and too slow."
"The enormous amount of aid the EU gives to its domestic agriculture is immoral and directly harmful."
"This aid is to the detriment of global competition, which we know is a precondition for prosperity, it justifies the reforms that are required in the agricultural sector and it reduces the choice available to us, the consumers."
"The proposal that the Commission has produced is important for further measures of liberalisation in line with the reforms of 2003."
"I cannot, therefore, vote in favour of those of Mr Santos's reports that would, to a large extent, mean the watering down of the Commission's proposal."
"in writing. - Today, an important vote was held."
"It was important for all farmers in the European Union."
"However, there are farmers who are not as strong as others because they have not had time to adapt to the agricultural structures of the European Union yet."
"They used all the capacities they had to build up sustainable agricultural enterprises after they got the chance to do so after 1989."
"These farmers are not the big producers that we know from France and Germany; they are still small."
"But they are extraordinarily important for my country, Poland."
"We need them if we are to have a rural area where people want to live and work in future."
"And therefore they need our special support."
"So I voted today to help small producers, i.e. in Poland, to show that they can count on our and on my support today and in the future."
"I voted in favour of the report on support schemes for farmers as part of the CAP."
"I support the common agricultural policy."
"The European Union needs to support farmers by granting direct payments and developing the rural infrastructure."
"The EU has to invest in agriculture, especially with a global food crisis looming."
"I supported Amendment 23 which recognises the need to support the sheep sector at Community level, which is in serious decline."
"I also feel that Member States should be authorised to use, as a supplement, 5% of their ceilings to support farmers or groups of producers in the form of financial contributions to expenses related to insurance premiums."
"Particular attention must be given to small farmers, which is why I supported Amendment 211, which introduces a derogation from the additional reduction in direct payments in the case of cooperatives or groups of farmers paid directly and which centralises grants for distribution to their members."
"I voted in favour of Amendments 114 and 118 which allow Member States to use up to 15% of their national ceilings to grant support to farmers to compensate for the specific disadvantages affecting those in the dairy sector, as well as producers of beef and veal, sheep meat and goat meat."
"The regulations for the application of the CAP 'health check' are a decisive step in the control of agricultural production by monopoly business groups, in the aim of increasing their profits."
"At the same time, they are paving the way for an all-out attack in 2013 on small- and medium-sized enterprises, which have already been weakened."
"Big business is exerting pressure for greater and faster reform of the CAP and for it to be adapted to the rules of the WTO, so that the multinationals can garner even more land, consolidate their sovereignty in the production and marketing of food and strengthen their position in international competition."
"The consequences of the CAP are already visible to small- and medium-scale farmers, especially following the decoupling of aid from production in the 2003 reform: the abandonment of farms, the decline in the rural population, grubbing up, the abandonment of the countryside and adverse environmental effects."
"They are also visible to workers, who face the unbearable cost of higher prices for foodstuffs and increased risks to public health arising from dangerous substances and dubious raw materials and production methods."
"We are radically opposed to the proposed regulations, which reveal the anti-rural character of the CAP."
"We call on small- and medium-scale farmers to join with the workers in the common fight against the anti-rural policy of the EU and capital."
"(Written explanation cut short in application of Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I voted today against the report on the Council Regulation amending the common agricultural policy."
"It is my view that the Regulation fails to meet the expectations of many producer groups and to reduce the gulf between farmers in the old and the new European Union states."
"I greatly deplore the fact that most MEPs do not perceive the problems facing European and Polish agriculture, which does require changes."
"However, I find the trend of the changes proposed by the European Commission impossible to accept."
"in writing. - With regard to the Santos report on the CAP Health Check, I need to clarify that, while I voted for the report, there is one aspect of the CAP, namely subsidies to grow tobacco, that I cannot support, nor have I ever supported."
"Tobacco is the most heavily subsidised crop per hectare in the EU."
"Since the early 1990s, the EU has spent about EUR 1 000 million annually on subsidies to tobacco growers."
"Despite the effort to reduce these subsidies, tobacco subsidies are still given out to tobacco farmers by the hundreds of millions (EUR 963 million in 2002)."
"This is by far the highest support, compared to other agricultural sectors, creating distorted incentives and high levels of inefficiency."
"It has been costly, the policy has not worked from a trade point of view, and it has been bad for the EU's reputation, exposing an awkward ambivalence in the EU's health goals."
"Subsidies should be removed completely from tobacco (but not from tobacco farmers) and switched to support healthy agriculture much quicker than is currently planned."
"The Commission's proposal to phase out milk quotas has been watered down by means of a requirement for a review as soon as 2010."
"What is more, the majority pushed through the establishment of a special milk fund."
"I believe that this report could have been better if we had managed to get a number of amendments aimed at greater market adaptation, such as a greater increase in the milk quotas, adopted."
"Unfortunately, none of these amendments were adopted, and I therefore voted against the report."
"We regret that our proposals were rejected."
"These argued for a different common agricultural policy based on providing support to producing farmers, in order to combat instability in productive sectors due to price variations, and on market regulation mechanisms guaranteeing a dignified income for small and medium-sized farmers, in order to prevent the decline in the rural world and the desertification of many regions."
"We also regret that our proposal which aimed to guarantee financing by the European Union of public insurance in the Member States was rejected."
"The aim was to guarantee farmers a minimum income in certain circumstances such as public disasters like droughts, storms, hail, forest fires or epizootic diseases."
"We reject the announcement of the end of the milk quota system, the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy and the continued injustices in the allocation of aid."
"The insistence on defending the European Commission's proposals, even with certain amendments, does not provide a firm enough basis to demand a different position from the Council."
"In its proposal, the European Commission is taking several important steps in the right direction in terms of creating a more competitive agricultural sector through further decoupling of aid and the abolition of compulsory set-aside, export subsidies, milk quotas, production aid and market support."
"The proposal also means a transfer of money from direct aid for agricultural production to rural development, with the focus on the four prioritised areas of climate change, renewable energy, water management and biodiversity."
"Since the European Parliament wanted to see fewer reforms and a slower pace of change, we chose to support the Commission's original proposal and to vote against Parliament's changes."
"Despite agreeing that the modifications recommended by the Commission to the common agricultural policy are necessary, I feel that, with regard to milk quotas, the Commission proposal is very harmful to less competitive European regions which are heavily dependent on the milk sector."
"I therefore feel that the dismantling of milk quotas through Regulation (EC) No 248/2008 should not have been started and that this dismantling should not continue as proposed by the Commission and accepted by the rapporteur."
"The Capoulas Santos report contains one positive element in that it calls for the preparation of a report in 2010 to analyse the state of the milk market."
"As a result, I did not vote against this report because I support the changes to sugar refining in the Azores which will allow this activity to continue in a region without any major economic alternatives."
"In today's vote on the health check for the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), I voted against the report on the milk sector."
"I am of the opinion that there should be no further increases in the quota without a market analysis."
"I believe that Parliament's demand to raise the quota by 1% in five stages, as proposed by the Commission, will send out completely the wrong signal."
"However, I very much welcome the fact that Parliament has spoken out once again in favour of the milk fund."
"The funds which will be saved from the agricultural budget and, in particular, in the milk sector, will be an efficient way of relieving the burden on this sector and of restructuring it."
"In addition, I support the call to the Commission, Parliament and the Council to produce a report on the milk market by 31 December 2010 which will form the basis for the discussion on further measures for controlling milk quotas."
"I also welcome the fact that the franchise for the modulation has been raised from EUR 5 000 to EUR 10 000 per year."
"This means that Parliament is in favour of giving further support to small farms, the majority of which can be found in our areas of Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria."
"in writing. - Conservative MEPs supported amendments allowing for milk quota increases of at least 2% per year before the abolition of the quota regime in 2015 as a means of preparing the ground for a liberalised, market-orientated dairy sector."
"We did not support those amendments which aimed to constrain quota increases."
"Ultimately, no significant amendments were adopted in either sense, which means the Commission proposal stood effectively un-amended."
"While the 1% annual increases proposed by the Commission are preferable to no increase, we still consider this to be too timid a step."
"We also reject the report's reluctance to do away with certain coupled payments and market support measures."
"As a result, we voted against the report overall."
"I voted in favour of the report on amending the 'Regulation on modifications to the common agricultural policy'."
"I supported Amendment 4 which allows dairy quotas to be increased by 2% for 2008-2009 and by 1% for the marketing years 2009-2010 and 2010-2011."
"This will provide the elements required for a suitable evaluation of the market situation in the milk sector."
"I also supported the fact that in cases where the situation in the milk market for the relevant marketing year will allow this, increases in milk quotas will be possible for the 12 new Member States."
"Against this background, we need to guarantee that the decision to amend the milk quota is taken in good time, before the start of the marketing year in question (1 April of the relevant year)."
"The payments from the European Agricultural Fund are intended to provide support for farmers, in order to ensure that the countryside remains in a good agricultural and environmental condition."
"While strict regulations apply to foods produced in the EU, goods are being imported at give-away prices which are not subject to these regulations."
"In addition, the milk quotas have been increased and will come to an end altogether in 2015, which will lead to falling milk prices and will leave small farmers in dire straits."
"Finally, the supermarket chains, such as Hofer, receive EU subsidies and further increase the pressure on domestic farmers, for example, by using milk as a loss leader."
"The ones who suffer the most are small farmers in rural areas who are dependent on milk production, but who do not have the opportunity to produce milk on a large scale."
"Consumers have to pay the increased prices for milk and food, but none of this extra money feeds back to the small producers."
"However, when prices fall, it is the farmers who feel the effects."
"This must change, otherwise we will be dependent on food imports because of the huge number of farmers leaving the land."
"Our farmers rely on subsidies and this is why I have voted in favour of the Capoulas Santos report."
"I voted in favour of the report on support for rural development given from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)."
"I voted in favour of Amendment 24 which specifies the start-up aid for young farmers amounting to EUR 75 000."
"This may be granted in the form of a single premium, the amount of which will not exceed EUR 50 000, or of an interest subsidy, the capitalised value of which will not exceed EUR 50 000."
"Where the two forms of aid are combined, the total amount will not be able to exceed EUR 75 000."
"I also voted in favour of Amendment 12 which, in order to ensure adequate funding for rural development programmes, maintains that greater flexibility should be introduced to enable the use, within the same Member State, of unspent resources from the Structural Funds for this purpose."
"Of course, it is important that different areas of policy are coordinated with one another, but this should not only be restricted to funding."
"In the EU, you have the feeling that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing."
"We promote the transport of goods all over Europe and then we promote environmental protection measures in order to combat the negative effects of the transport."
"Another example is the support for tobacco production being put in place at the same time as measures to reduce tobacco consumption."
"The same principle applies to rural areas."
"On the one hand, there are additional subsidy funds and, on the other hand, as a result of the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty and the boundless enthusiasm for privatisation, the infrastructure outside the main centres of population is being dismantled and rural areas are becoming increasingly cut off."
"If the post office in Austria is privatised as expected, within a decade, the post offices outside the cities will be at least 20 kilometres apart."
"Rural areas are increasingly becoming the place where the elderly live."
"The removal of this important point of contact for older people will lead to them becoming more and more isolated, not only elderly people, but also the socially disadvantaged and people with impaired mobility are particularly affected by the infrastructure cuts."
"I have voted in favour of this report in the hope that it will form the basis for better coordinated strategies in future and will counteract these negative developments."
"I voted in favour of Mr Capoulas Santos's report."
"One of the reasons why I voted in favour is because, in a particular way, during periods of crisis, agriculture is one of the areas which need to be given special attention."
"In periods like this, consumption generally decreases."
"This is why investment in agriculture needs to be aimed at reducing operating costs, but without affecting the quality of agricultural produce."
"I also feel that during the forthcoming period, we should reconsider and determine the real value of agricultural produce. This is because, otherwise, more and more farmers are going to give up farming land in conditions where they will no longer be able to sell their produce at a realistic price."
"There are frequently cases where the cost of agricultural production does not even cover the investment."
"On the other hand, let us not forget that in the agricultural sector, we need to identify and use alternative fuels, a strategic area for the whole world."
"This report is relevant based on the issues which it raises."
"Agriculture needs to feature among the EU's priorities."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"

"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment - Single application procedure for residence and work"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"by Mrs E. Klamt, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment - C6-0011/2008 -;"
"by Mr P. Gaubert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State - C6-0470/2007 -."
"The House services tell me that Mrs Klamt's father has died and she is therefore not present."
"Naturally, we send our condolences to Mrs Klamt and thank Mr Weber for assuming the responsibility of acting as rapporteur in this debate."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, the reason why I am speaking today has already been mentioned."
"This is because Mrs Klamt has had a close family bereavement."
"We would like to convey our condolences to her."
"I would like to start by expressing my gratitude on behalf of the rapporteur for the excellent cooperation in this area."
"As you know, the report has been produced in close cooperation between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of the European Parliament, as part of the process for increasing collaboration."
"For this reason, I would like to thank the fellow Members who were involved and also the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The rapporteur would also like to thank in particular the French Presidency, with which she has had close contact over recent months."
"However, as a Member of the European Parliament, I would like to emphasise once again that it would have been better if the agreement at the level of the ambassadors had taken place after the deliberations in the European Parliament."
"This would have been a pleasing indication of the close cooperation."
"To come to the point, we are in competition with countries throughout the world for highly qualified workers."
"With a proportion of 1.72% of the total workforce, the European Union is far behind all its competitors."
"Australia, Canada, the United States and even Switzerland have a higher proportion of highly qualified workers in their workforces."
"In the competition for the best and cleverest brains, we in the European Union are starting from an unfavourable position."
"We all know that this question plays a decisive role in our future and in the ability of our national economies to introduce innovation."
"Using eight compromise amendments, Ewa Klamt was able to come to an agreement with the other groups in the Parliament on the essential criteria."
"The report by Ewa Klamt, which was agreed on by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, contains the main criteria for the admission of highly qualified workers from third countries."
"The first aspect is the definition of 'highly qualified workers' and here it is a question of the wages that are paid."
"The scope of the directive includes, on the one hand, people who have a higher education qualification and, on the other, people who have comparable professional experience covering a period of at least five years."
"The Commission had initially proposed three years' professional experience."
"The European Parliament has also gone one step further on the salary criterion."
"The lower salary limit should be 1.7 times the average gross annual wage."
"The Council has chosen a factor of 1.5."
"I would therefore like to emphasise that the European Parliament is calling for a higher-level definition of 'highly qualified workers'."
"The next issue is the question of the brain drain, which is an important consideration."
"How should we approach this challenge?"
"We should not be recruiting highly qualified workers from third countries where they are desperately needed."
"An application for a Blue Card can be rejected if the brain drain is a genuine problem."
"However, we must also be honest with ourselves."
"Although we take the issue of the brain drain seriously, we are competing on a worldwide market and therefore, a time limit on the Blue Card is necessary."
"Of course, administrative factors are not the only ones which play an important part in attracting highly qualified workers to Europe."
"Cultural issues, such as openness to immigration and attracting the best people, are also important."
"However, we must not disregard the added value which the Blue Card can bring to Europe."
"For the first time, we have succeeded in creating a standardised admission system covering the whole of Europe."
"This represents genuine added value."
"Tomorrow's vote is also important for us because we have introduced a special amendment which emphasises Community preference."
"This means that when European workers who are qualified for a specific job are available, they must be given priority over issuing a Blue Card."
"We should also emphasise that we were all agreed, and we should make sure that the home countries are informed of this, that although we have standardised the procedure, we do not want to lay down any European quotas."
"In other words, we do not want to specify what the levels of immigration should be."
"This must, and should, remain under national control."
"On behalf of the rapporteur, I would once again like to thank everyone involved."
"I hope that the result tomorrow will be as good as the result we have already achieved in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am particularly happy that our legislative debate today is dealing with legal immigration as this enables us to take part in a debate here that is not focusing on or is no longer focusing on the criminalisation of illegal immigration, but which highlights, rightly, the positive aspects and considerable contribution of legal immigration to our European businesses."
"It is important, in the current demographic context, to remind Europeans of the significant contribution of immigration to the economic prosperity and development of the European Union."
"The latest demographic forecasts in our possession reveal major risks concerning the viability of the pension, health and social security schemes."
"Faced with these situations, the European Union has made a clear choice: to promote a common immigration policy encouraging legal, economic immigration, managed efficiently in line with national market requirements."
"Therefore, we are debating today two far-reaching, pragmatic legislative texts, which are meant to meet the labour requirements clearly defined by our Member States."
"By adopting these two texts simultaneously, the European Parliament is sending a clear message of openness, that we must seize upon fully to explain to public opinion, to our fellow citizens, and to third countries the positive things we are doing in terms of immigration."
"We need not be ashamed of our choices in this matter and we have no need for lessons on this point from third-country leaders who are unable to conduct the appropriate policies to avoid their populations risking their lives to seek better conditions in Europe."
"To focus on the directive on the single procedure, for which I am the rapporteur, firstly, the proposal creates a one-stop shop system for third-country nationals who want to reside in a Member State country in order to work there."
"It provides for a single application procedure that is simpler, shorter and faster, both for the employer and for the migrant, the objective being to reduce the bureaucratic procedures and simplify the administrative actions."
"This procedure and single permit will also facilitate permit validity checks, both for the administration and for employers."
"Secondly, the draft directive will ensure equal treatment for all third-country nationals in a certain number of areas."
"Recognising the fundamental social and economic rights of immigrants legally present within the territory of the European Union and of new arrivals will help improve their integration and will therefore lead to better social cohesion."
"Equal treatment concerns working conditions, health, safety in the workplace, education, vocational training, recognition of qualifications, social security, including health care, the export of pensions paid, access to goods and services and fiscal advantages."
"Realistic restrictions are indeed planned, but we shall ensure they are not greater than what is planned in the Blue Card."
"The interests of immigrants must be taken into account and their rights must be protected."
"In fact, the figures reveal that the unemployment rate amongst immigrants is higher than that of European Union citizens, that they are often in insecure employment and that mastering the language of the host country remains a significant barrier."
"The two texts proposed by the Commission, and I take this opportunity to applaud their common sense, correspond to our idea of immigration policy: a reasonably firm and humane policy."
"I would also like to thank the Council and the French Presidency for the exceptional and fairly swift efforts made to pave the way for the rapid adoption of these two perfectly complementary texts."
"Mr President, rapporteurs, Manfred Weber and Patrick Gaubert, honourable Members, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Barrot, Mr Weber, please pass on our condolences and all our sympathy to Mrs Klamt who obviously cannot be with us."
"Almost four years ago, in January 2005, the European Commission announced an important debate on the prospects of a proactive European policy on economic migration."
"It was noted that the resistance and reservations were still numerous and extensive efforts were still needed to reach a consensus on this point. Patrick Gaubert pointed this out."
"He also reiterated how striking it was to note how opinion has changed since that date."
"Economic migrations have become the first pillar of the common immigration policy, that Member States have chosen to adopt by approving the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council of 16 October."
"The European Parliament will vote today in plenary on the first two Community texts that set up common tools on economic migration."
"The first, the Blue Card, allows access throughout Europe to highly qualified workers and will guarantee a set of rights and administrative facilities."
"The second, the single permit, which merges a residence permit and a work permit, will significantly reduce the administrative difficulties for all persons coming to work legally in the European Union and will guarantee them a set of rights throughout the Union."
"These two texts demonstrate that the Union is truly committed to promoting legal migration, as the rapporteurs have pointed out, that it wants to make the lives of third-country nationals legally resident on our territory easier, in short that it is not the 'Fortress Europe' that some people would like to see."
"I, too, would like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the rapporteurs on these two proposals."
"Their work has opened the way for very active cooperation - and I am delighted to emphasise this - between the Council and the European Parliament throughout the work."
"First of all, I shall deal with the Blue Card issue."
"Less than a year after the presentation of the Commission's proposal, the Council managed to provide a general approach."
"This was no easy task given the unanimity rule."
"The Council took into account, thanks to the excellent cooperation we have had with Mrs Klamt, numerous areas of discussion from the European Parliament, be it the definition of the card beneficiaries, its delivery conditions, the attention paid to the ethical recruitment method and the possibilities for circular migration, as well as the elimination of discrimination based on age or the necessary flexibility regarding card validity."
"There is one point on which the positions of the European Parliament and the Council differ considerably and that is the wage criterion question."
"The Council accepted a lower threshold, with further possible derogations for sectors experiencing shortages, which opens up the advantages of the Blue Card to more people."
"Given the proposals that have been made, I hope that the European Parliament will be able to accept the position of the Council and thereby broaden the scope of this Blue Card."
"This work promises success that will send a triple message to our fellow European citizens, a message about the determination of Europe to organise the possibilities for legal migration, especially for professional purposes."
"It is really the first text in the context of this specific objective."
"It is also a message about the responsiveness of European integration, with this symbol that the European Blue Card will become, offering real mobility within Europe for highly qualified third-country nationals and members of their families, in accordance with the powers of each Member State, for the Member States will, of course, retain control of their labour markets."
"The third message relates to the importance that the Union attaches to enhancing the draw on skills and talents in a world that is now globalised, in accordance with the efforts undertaken to stimulate Europe's competitiveness within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In this way, the European Union reconciles its wish to increase its attractiveness with its faithfulness to commitments to promote the development of the poorest countries."
"The Council ensured that a whole series of proposals, aimed at preventing and restricting the brain drain, was included in the directive."
"I should like to state this solemnly here and I shall, of course, return to this in response to the different speeches that I am sure you will make, because I am aware of your entirely legitimate attachment to effective and equal cooperation with countries of origin, in particular African countries."
"I now turn to the directive establishing a single permit, which merges the residence permit and the work permit."
"This is also an important text which makes economic migrations considerably easier, in a context that is legal, transparent, responsive and predictable, while reducing administrative procedures which, too often, hamper the migrations that are necessary to the economic and demographic balance of the Union."
"Above all, this text creates a common set of rights for all third-country workers who work and reside legally in the European Union."
"The initial reception given to this directive did not make it possible to envisage substantial progress in the near future."
"The work carried out on the Blue Card has, nonetheless, little by little enabled the ground to be cleared in this difficult matter."
"The Presidency has spared no efforts in making as much progress as possible in finalising this proposal, and has naturally taken the utmost account of the positions of this House."
"Work on this text has been stepped up and we are confident that the main elements will be established by the end of December."
"The proposal will be examined for the first time by the ministers during the 'Justice and Home Affairs' Council session on 27 and 28 November."
"Quite clearly, a strong signal from the European Parliament regarding the appropriateness and added value of this text will enhance the movement that is starting to take shape and which can pave the way for the final adoption of this directive which, clearly, simplifies migrants' lives."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs Klamt - and I wish to echo the expression of sympathy that Mr Jouyet addressed to her - and, of course, Patrick Gaubert."
"Their reports are of high quality and I thank the two rapporteurs from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Jeleva and Mr Masiel."
"I also thank Manfred Weber, who stood in for Mrs Klamt."
"The two proposed directives are the first in a series announced by the Commission in 2005 in its action plan on legal migration."
"They are important not just for the migrants themselves but also for our Member States and their companies."
"To echo the words of Patrick Gaubert and the speech you have just made, Mr Jouyet, they show the true importance of this pact on immigration and asylum, which the French Presidency saw through to completion, and they prove that this pact is, in fact, balanced and also demonstrates the desire of Europeans to open up to these migratory flows which may be particularly useful and prove to be very positive for the future of our European society."
"These two texts, therefore, allow us to show the face of an open European Union, welcoming the citizens of third countries, who may thus legally take up residence and work at whatever level at which they are qualified, and, needless to say, in full enjoyment of their rights."
"They also prove the European Union's ability to agree on common economic immigration instruments and thus find an appropriate balance between the expectations of a society, the rights of migrants and the needs of their country of origin."
"I will begin with the horizontal instrument, the Directive on the single permit and the rights of migrant workers."
"I am pleased that the broad outlines of the Commission's original proposal have been confirmed, especially in relation to the single procedure, the single permit for citizens of third countries admitted as workers, and the common set of rights for all, for all migrants working legally, whatever the initial reason for their stay."
"It is absolutely fundamental to ensure that all citizens of third countries who are working legally should enjoy the same minimum set of rights in all Member States."
"This, it seems to me, is in line with all the great European principles relating to fundamental rights."
"Also Mr Gaubert, your report suggests new or additional features that the Commission can support."
"I wish to mention three amendments in particular: the amendment to grant a temporary residence permit where there is a delay in the administration's consideration of a request for renewal, the amendments strengthening the procedural rights and, finally, the amendments which provide for the option of applying for the single permit when already residing legally in a Member State."
"The Commission understands and also shares the European Parliament's desire to eliminate any restriction in the article providing for equality of treatment and, turning to the Presidency, I obviously hope that, as far as possible, the Council will prove open to all of these amendments."
"I now come to the proposed 'European Blue Card' in Mrs Klamt's report, of which Mr Weber reminded us."
"The aim of the European Blue Card is to make the Union more attractive, to increase its ability to attract highly qualified workers from third countries, so that legal immigration can help to strengthen the competitiveness of our economy, as a complement to the Lisbon Strategy."
"The report set before your House supports the Commission on the need and urgency of introducing this common system in Europe."
"The Commission willingly subscribes to the report's conclusions, therefore, but with some reservations."
"Firstly, the Commission is certainly favourable to the amendments which make the system more attractive, for example, those aimed at removing any restriction on equality of treatment and access to the labour market after two years as a holder of a Blue Card."
"Secondly, the inclusion of refugees in the category of legal residents able to benefit from this system."
"This facility was missing from the initial proposal but we find it valuable from every aspect, be it political, humanitarian or economic."
"Finally, the retention of the criterion on professional experience in certain professions."
"In the new technologies sector, in particular, a person's experience and capabilities are more valuable than any diplomas."
"In contrast, the Commission cannot accept the amendment limiting the provision of the Blue Card just to citizens of countries with which the Union has signed agreements."
"True, this amendment is aimed at reducing the negative effects on developing countries, but the Commission believes that this would lead to an excessively restricted application of the directive."
"In addition, this would risk discrimination against highly qualified migrants who could then use the national systems, over which neither the Commission, nor your Parliament, exercises any control."
"Similarly, you can see my reservations about making the derogation of the right to circular migration an option."
"Frankly, this is more of a disagreement than a reservation."
"The option of returning to the country of origin for two years without losing long-term resident status is essential if we wish to allow exchanges of staff between universities and hospitals, for example, or even to encourage the diasporas to make a commitment to developing their countries of origin."
"This would restrict circular migration which we increasingly want to see developing."
"Finally, I will say a few words about the obvious need to take account of the state of the labour market."
"As Manfred Weber reminded us, we have a Europe whose labour markets are separated and it is up to each State to determine how many immigrants could be allowed in."
"Obviously, we must also not forget that, in the labour market field, there is the duty to allow in all the European citizens of the other Member States."
"To conclude, I turn to the Presidency, to Mr Jean-Pierre Jouyet, and hope that, as far as possible, the ministers meeting in the Council next week can take as much as possible from the amendments of the European Parliament which, certainly, provide added value, and I hope that, before the end of the year, we can show that this Europe, far from turning in on itself, wishes to open up to these migratory flows, in the knowledge that we increasingly wish to move towards concerted management of migratory flows with the countries of immigration."
"(Applause)"
"?"
"With the Blue Card proposal, it is hoped that the qualified workforce will be attracted to the EU and be given conditions to come temporarily but, at the same time, to remain long term."
"The proposal states that no brain drain will occur, but rather a brain return - circulation."
"This is hardly likely."
"How does the proposal appear in the context of the development cooperation policies?"
"With the introduction of the Blue Card, developing countries will lose specialists, in whose training the EU also participated, particularly from the most sensitive areas - education and health."
"The shortage of those specialists, perhaps, will have to be filled by volunteers from our countries."
"Furthermore, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark are not participating in the Blue Card with its ethics of not inviting specialists from sensitive sectors in developing countries."
"In this case, initiatives to support developing countries seem false."
"Apparently, the interests of business still prevail."
"In reality, the Blue Card may cause developing countries great intellectual damage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, the Directive on the admission of skilled third-country nationals to the EU is the first valuable step towards a common European Union immigration policy."
"It is the first serious attempt to restrict illegal immigration and promote legal immigration in Europe."
"In preparing the Blue Card scheme, we were torn between the fear of its abuse by third country nationals and the hope that the new arrivals will meet the needs of our labour markets and contribute to the development of our economy."
"The Blue Card is intended to become Europe's calling card, making it an attractive place to work and live for the skilled workers needed by our small and medium-sized enterprises."
"From the point of view of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which I represent today, it was important to ensure that workers from outside the European Union are not treated less well than our own citizens."
"For this reason, we needed to make provision for equal pay for equal work, ensure that families could be united and provide access to basic social benefits, so as to achieve rapid and complete integration of the arrivals."
"In conclusion, may I thank the shadow rapporteurs for their assistance and inform the French Presidency that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs worked fast to assist it in the achievement of its goals before the end of its term of office."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (BG) I would like to congratulate Mr Gaubert on his report on the Council Directive on a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of the European Union."
"I was draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs regarding this directive."
"As an MEP for Bulgaria, one of the ten Member States which have been subjected to transitional periods, I am strongly opposed to restrictions on free access to the labour market for a considerable part of the European workforce."
"For this reason, I welcome the efforts by European institutions to secure equal treatment for everybody who resides and legally works in the European Union."
"The purpose of this directive is to act as a horizontal tool, bearing in mind that particular directives are already in effect or are to be adopted."
"I have in mind the Directives on seasonal workers, workers who are long-term residents and 'EU Blue Cards' which we are discussing today."
"While formulating our stance, I had the support of colleagues from our parliamentary commission and believe that the texts we have proposed set the rights of third-country workers in a balanced way."
"I would like to mention here the right to education, the recognition of degrees and certificates, working conditions, access to social security, tax rebates and others."
"This directive provides a minimum, general selection of rights to third-country workers in relation to work."
"Consequently, the rights given to them should therefore not exceed the rights guaranteed under particular directives."
"Namely, it is for this reason that the European Commission's proposal envisages particular conditions for exercising these rights."
"In the final version of the stance, which was put to the vote by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, these conditions are, however, lacking."
"This has put us in a situation where there are blatant discrepancies such as with the 'EU Blue Card' as well as with that guaranteed under other particular directives, including the Directive concerning third-country nationals who are long-term residents of the EU."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this time of financial and economic crisis, it is necessary that we be realistic."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I appeal to you that we take a responsible outlook and vote for a logically sound and consistent document."
"Thank you very much, Mr President, for the floor."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of the present migration directive package, today Parliament is debating and tomorrow it will adopt important and long-term reports."
"Currently, there are 27 different systems within the European Union for regulating the status of third-country nationals."
"The two new directives guarantee a simpler procedure for highly qualified workers, and include the possibility for a simpler system of entry and residence."
"We can see that these two directives can introduce an effective compromise system in place of today's fragmented regulations."
"The rapporteurs for the European People's Party have done serious and important work in this regard."
"The report on the employment of highly qualified workers, which has come to be known as the 'Blue Card' report, is a good, balanced report."
"Rapporteur Ewa Klamt deserves special praise."
"We likewise congratulate Mr Gaubert for his report."
"At the same time, the People's Party is committed to making sure that the clause regarding preferential treatment for EU nationals is an important part of the Directive."
"I therefore wish to draw the attention of those fellow Members who object to the principle of preferential treatment and who propose amendments seeking to remove the establishment of this principle from the report to the fact that, as a Hungarian citizen and in the name of the citizens of all the new Member States, I consider it unacceptable not to establish firmly the principle that workers from Member States are given preference over workers from third countries."
"This approach is particularly unacceptable and reflective of hypocrisy when we, as nationals of the new Member States are still - to this day and for who knows how much longer - discriminated against in numerous old Member States when it comes to access to the labour market."
"It is shameful that Europe speaks of our Union in such a way that it still treats the citizens of the new Member States as second-class citizens in this regard. Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I would ask that my initial words are not taken into account by the infernal time machine as they are intended to add to the message of condolence conveyed by this House to Mrs Klamt and, in particular, to congratulate the rapporteurs."
"I will now start."
"I congratulate the rapporteurs because, with these two proposals, we are taking a qualitative step towards a common immigration policy and we are promoting legal migration which is a key element of our global approach."
"The common set of rights and the single residence and work permit for legal migrants must be extended to the highest possible number of workers."
"As a result, we socialists ask that no category of workers is excluded."
"The 'Blue Card' offers an opportunity for migrants to settle with their families and work in our countries."
"It opens a single door to 27 labour markets."
"However, it cannot be solely highly qualified workers who enter through this door."
"Commissioner, we therefore expect the Commission to shortly present its proposals on other labour categories."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must avoid a brain drain."
"This Blue Card must not become a passport encouraging vital human resources to leave developing countries."
"For every qualified professional who comes to Europe, the PSE Group wants us to fund the training of a new professional in the country of origin."
"Finally, Europe must be an attractive destination, not only for talent coming from outside the Union, but also for our own European talent."
"In 2007, nearly 300 000 highly qualified Europeans left to work outside the Union."
"We must do everything we can to keep them in the European house."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it seems as though Conservatives and Socialists are hand in glove with each other on the Blue Card, leaving my group lost in amazement, to be honest."
"For a while now, the EU has been trying to come up with a comprehensive package on migration, including measures to tackle illegal migration as well as measures to push Europe's forward-looking strategy on legal migration."
"You might remember the very emotional debate on the Return Directive."
"At the time, the ALDE Group said that the return policy could not be looked upon in an isolated way: it should be seen as an integral part - a necessary part - of a total package for migration, which is still very true."
"Today, we finally have the chance to give a strong message on the need for better opportunities for legal migration, to address the demands of businesses in urgent need of qualified workers."
"The fact that we could not expect too much from the EPP on legal migration is unfortunate but could, in a way, be foreseen."
"The fact that the PSE is, broadly speaking, happily in line with the EPP on the Blue Card amendments makes my hair stand on end."
"Following the vote in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the scheme has been watered down significantly."
"Far too many restrictions have been introduced, which do not help in any way when trying to make the EU more attractive to highly qualified workers."
"It must be clear that the intention of the Blue Card is to increase the competitiveness of the EU economy."
"The Blue Card proposal is not an easy attempt to take the best and leave the rest, thereby creating a brain drain from developing countries."
"The current trend is that the vast majority of the highly qualified workers emigrate to the US, Canada or Australia instead of the EU."
"If we want to reverse this trend, we have to be ambitious."
"This House is about to adopt a report that would weaken an already very modest Commission proposal even further."
"To be clear, the ALDE Group is a very strong supporter of the Blue Card."
"However, we feel that the current text does not bring about the much-needed change for legal migration but that it confirms Member States' protectionist practices instead."
"We all know that the Council has been excellent in making ambitious statements, but we also know that, too often, effective decision making is constrained by the inability of the Member States to really work together in their mutual interest, and that effective decision making in this field is being undermined by a very emotional and muddled debate on legal migration, owing to a lack of focus."
"The Tampere Programme, the Hague Programme, the French immigration pact, the Stockholm Programme coming up - at the end of the day, it all comes down to the transposition of these basic commitments into concrete and effective measures."
"If we want the EU to benefit from the proposed scheme, we have to be ambitious and therefore I hope you will vote accordingly tomorrow."
"Mr President, the available data alerts us to the fact that the European Union is not a location commonly chosen by skilled third-country workers, unlike countries such as the United States, Canada or Australia."
"For instance, only 5.5% of skilled migrants from the Maghreb countries come to the EU, whereas United States and Canada accept approximately 54%."
"This is due to the huge differentiation of the migrant reception systems in the EU, which greatly hampers movement between countries."
"Only six Member States have special skilled migrant employment programmes."
"It is therefore vital to introduce a more coherent approach by Member States to the European migration policy, incorporating integration and political issues."
"We must standardise regulations, so as to be able to control migrant flows both into and inside Europe, and thus give skilled migrants a better chance."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their positive approach on these partial - but very long-awaited - more positive measures on migration and the position of third-country nationals within the European Union."
"I welcome, too, the Commission's more positive view of certain of Parliament's amendments."
"The starting point for my group, the Greens, has been to have rights which are as equivalent as possible to those of EU nationals - a common set of rights - and for the system to be as open and as welcoming as possible."
"I thoroughly agree with Members who have said that it is a scandal that EU nationals are not, at present, treated on an equal basis, but I would urge Members not to share the cautious approach of our Member States in giving our own nationals equal treatment by penalising third-country nationals."
"There is absolutely no doubt that the EU has a need for workers at a variety of skill levels."
"We want people who want to come to use and develop their skills from a wide variety of countries - India, New Zealand, Ghana, China, wherever - and that is why we will not be supporting Amendment 84, nor indeed Amendment 24, which talks about granting Blue Cards only to those highly qualified migrants from countries with which we have previously concluded partnerships."
"I am not sure what the United States would say about that."
"It is true that we need to be careful regarding certain sectors in the world's poorest countries, but we also need to be careful that these are not the only people who cannot develop their skills in the European Union."
"We also need to take care that we are not using this particular proposal in order to write a general development policy."
"This is a global proposal."
"It covers all potential countries in the world."
"Yes, we also need to maximise the skills in our own Member States, and that is why we support the amendment recalling, for example, the anti-discrimination legislation, which we also hope will be ambitious in its next stage."
"So we will support all amendments which safeguard the rights of individuals and we will vote against those which try to delete those rights."
"We welcome the efforts to simplify procedures, but we too regret that Parliament has not been more ambitious, especially on the Blue Card, and that it has, in fact, put further hurdles in the way."
"So it is unlikely that we will be supporting that proposal as it is, although we certainly support the idea in principle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I would also like to express my condolences to Mrs Klamt."
"I would like to immediately examine the substance of today's debate, since the European Union is continuing to adopt a schizophrenic policy with regard to immigration."
"This is happening in the Member States' policies: they have signed the pact on immigration and asylum, which expressly states that zero immigration is harmful and unrealistic for the European Union, but then we discover that my country's minister of home affairs is advocating the closure of the borders for the next two years."
"Community policy on immigration continues to be schizophrenic."
"Mr Gaubert is right in saying that we are facing a demographic crisis in Europe and that we need more immigration."
"The Commission has explained it to us: we need 50 million immigrants by 2060, but we are doing nothing to encourage them to come, and instead we have made it a priority to harmonise the return policy."
"Today, we are debating a single residence and work permit exclusively for those who are already in European Union territory and we are creating the Blue Card for highly qualified workers, which will have an impact of only between 1.5% and 3% on the immigration rate in Europe, and thus will play a minimal role as compared to our real requirements for workers in Europe."
"Currently, there are approximately 6 million unauthorised workers in the European Union who have already been absorbed into the labour market and who are kept in unauthorised positions because, clearly, such a situation is convenient in keeping down labour costs and cutting down on social welfare protection."
"We think that we ought to start with a regularisation programme for these workers who have already been absorbed into the labour market: we think that the Blue Card is a mistake, in making a selection upstream of immigration; we think that the definition of highly qualified workers is too restrictive and we think that Community preference is a form of outright discrimination."
"We believe that there ought to be a complete change in direction for immigration policy."
"We know how to read the fact that the Blue Card is the first signal in opening up legal immigration channels, but this is not enough to ensure that our group will vote in favour."
"Mr President, Member States should continue to decide for themselves about the right of entry of migrants to their territories, and as long as there are people without jobs in our Member States, I continue to be doubtful as to the need for stimulating legal immigration."
"The Commission proposal, contrary to what is being suggested, does not bring a simple procedure any closer."
"Alongside the Commission proposal, national regulations remain in force for migrants with sound qualifications, and additional requirements are possible."
"What value then does a European regulation add?"
"This does not answer the question of educational establishments and industry."
"They want an unambiguous system for workers and students from outside the European Union, and this is set to create additional red tape, while less was promised."
"I should like to call for a system whereby immigration policy is left with the Member States."
"In that way, every Member State can have its own clear set of procedures."
"In an EU context, we can then agree on whether people are allowed to travel freely and to move to other countries."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Commissioner, I thank you most sincerely."
"Through your points of view, you have just provided me with the arguments for my next electoral campaigns, relative to this question of immigration, since you yourselves speak of - and I quote - 'an open European Union, opening up to migratory flows, the advantages of the Blue Card opened up to as many people as possible, attracting skills, not hindering immigration'."
"See nothing, hear nothing, know nothing - that could be the motto of the European institutions regarding the immigration question, while the people of Europe have been suffering daily for 20 years in relation to this question, with all the social and economic consequences in terms of identity, security, job insecurity, poverty and unemployment."
"I hear references to the rights of immigrants, but who mentions the social rights of the workers?"
"Who speaks of those who, in their millions and tens of millions in Europe, are in a difficult social situation, who do not access employment at any level of hierarchy or qualifications?"
"Furthermore, the integration policy conducted in Europe is a true national disintegration policy, of which we have fallen foul through excessive Communitisation."
"The Blue Card that you are proposing is nothing but an indraught to the entire world to attract millions of new immigrants, whereas it is not this policy that needs to be pursued, but a policy for returning immigrants to their countries, a policy of national and Community preference, a policy of national and Community protection."
"Finally, by plundering the elites in the developing world, you are going to prevent the economic development of these countries."
"These peoples and these countries need capital and skilled workers."
"You are depriving them of both."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, unlike the previous speaker, I am clearly against Fortress Europe and therefore support active policies to admit economic migrants."
"The only way to have a balanced immigration policy is to be firm in combating illegal immigration and to boldly regulate legal migration."
"In this context, we approve the Directive on the 'Blue Card'."
"However, we do not want to limit migration solely to highly qualified people, thereby shutting the door on all other migrant workers with fewer qualifications."
"Over the next few years, both categories will be essential to the economic and social development of Europe."
"In this respect, we are talking about millions of people."
"For this reason, I also support the proposal for a directive which aims to establish a single application procedure for a single residence and work permit."
"In addition to offering clear benefits in terms of simplification, cutting red tape and facilitating control of their status, it allows a single common set of rights to be recognised to migrant workers legally residing in the Union territory."
"With the exception of seasonal and highly qualified workers who will be covered by specific directives, all migrants will benefit from a set of labour rights equivalent to those enjoyed by nationals of the host Member State."
"This equal treatment throughout the Community area should help to combat situations of labour exploitation and improve integration of these workers, thereby leading to better social cohesion."
"I agree with what Ewa Klamt has said: it is useful to create a common system for the admission of highly qualified workers, instead of having 27 different systems."
"I agree with the proposals made by Mrs Klamt in terms of tightening up the admission conditions, at the same time as improving prevention of the brain drain."
"While applauding the efforts of Mrs Klamt and Mr Gaubert, I should like to end, Mr President, by regretting that, once again, the opinion of this Parliament does not seem to particularly count."
"Everything indicates that a political decision has already been taken by the Council without waiting for the vote in Parliament, which I regret."
"(DE) Mr President, first of all I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mrs Klamt and to congratulate her on this report."
"We need highly qualified workers from third countries on our labour markets, partly because we have invested too little in education and training and have made too many skilled workers unemployed, who are now no longer available on the labour market."
"Therefore, we must do more for education and training at home and we must also open up our labour markets to highly qualified immigrants."
"The Blue Card is the first step in the right direction and represents a possible triple win situation."
"Firstly, in the medium term, companies can fill some of their vacancies with skilled workers and benefit from new international expertise."
"Secondly, the highly qualified workers and the members of their immediate families can gain a different perspective which they may not have experienced in their home country."
"Thirdly, when they return, either temporarily or permanently, to their country of origin, they can make a significant contribution to economic growth there."
"The concern that this may lead to a brain drain is well-founded."
"Therefore, we recommend not actively advertising in the education and health sectors, in particular in those countries which have been hit by emigration and the lack of skilled and unskilled workers."
"However, this is question of development policy which we will not be able to resolve here."
"In addition, we must remember that individual citizens are not owned by states."
"Just as our citizens are able to look for work in other countries or leave their country of origin without facing major obstacles, it should be possible for people from other countries to work in the EU."
"The principle of equal pay for equal work is, of course, important to us."
"It is true that things can always be improved and improvements are necessary."
"However, I believe this to be the first step in the right direction."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to express, like many others, my congratulations to our two rapporteurs, Mrs Klamt, to whom I present the condolences of my group, and Patrick Gaubert."
"However, Mr Jouyet, I should also like to include the French Presidency in this because, regarding the Blue Card at least, the French Presidency has demonstrated a high level of commitment which has enabled a political agreement to be obtained at Council level."
"I might add that I do not think there was the same resolve on Mr Gaubert's report."
"As fellow Members have pointed out, the European Union is taking, with these two reports, an important step in its migratory policy."
"We all know, and we have often regretted this over the last few years, that most of our time and resources have been spent in combating, necessarily, illegal immigration."
"Today, however, with these two texts, the European Union is sanctioning the need and importance of an active legal economic immigration policy."
"We all know that legal economic immigration is a necessity for the European continent, and it is not the obscurantism of a few fascists that is likely to make us change our opinion."
"By introducing the obligation for Member States to grant a single residence and work permit, Patrick Gaubert's report also aims to ensure the right of immigrant workers to equal treatment in as many areas as possible."
"I should like to send a message to my friend Giusto Catania."
"Giusto, you made a silly mistake."
"The single permit does not just apply to workers already within the territory of the European Union."
"Equal rights also concern those who will come and not only those already here."
"Therefore, when you criticise something in order to have arguments to reject a report, I am sorry but you really should try to read it correctly."
"For its part, Mrs Klamt's report sets out to define the entry conditions for highly qualified nationals on to European soil and this is something we absolutely need."
"One final remark on this matter, since fellow Members of my group focused on this, is as follows."
"I share with them a certain number of regrets."
"The system - I am not talking here of principles -, the system is slightly overcautious, at times too protectionist, but fundamentally it represents a necessary step forward, and that is why I, personally and as Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, shall vote in favour of the two reports."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for many years we have been hearing, on the subject of immigration, a series of calls accompanied by schedules, telling us the lovely fairytale of the need - also stated by the UN - for the continuous expansion of the Western economy and, in particular, we have heard European countries claim there is a need for tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of new workers for Europe."
"Now, unfortunately for everyone, the financial crisis is squeezing everyone in our country, and even the CGL, which is the biggest trade union, is saying, at least via some of its leaders in the Veneto regions: 'Honestly, our workers are at risk of losing their jobs, and we need to start thinking seriously about their jobs'."
"The Commission is therefore doing well to repudiate all these lovely fairy-tales of the past and to work on that 3% of immigration that can still be useful, where there can be good grounds for people to enter the EU."
"Europe certainly still needs qualified immigrants, and they can be useful to us, but there is a huge obstacle in terms of the rights of the immigrants' countries not to have their best brains taken away from them."
"This proposal then is, in itself, a good one, but what is missing is its final development, which would be to encourage and facilitate the return of these specialised workers to their countries to protect them from the effects of globalisation."
"(FR) Mr President, six months after the shameful vote on the 'Return' directive that received so many jeers and criticisms internationally, I very much doubt that the Union will be able, by adopting these two texts on the Blue Card and the single permit, to redeem itself on the international stage."
"Why?"
"Because it was announced, very pompously, that a genuine European policy on legal migration would be established, and we now find ourselves with a third-rate status for workers, which provides no social support, the loss of the residence permit if they lose their job, limited access to unions and restricted freedom of movement."
"This is not the hallmark of a great ambition and the Union is far from rivalling the United States or Canada with this Blue Card, assuming moreover that that is itself a laudable objective."
"Is it really asking too much to grant genuine social protection guarantees and equal treatment, the same as for national workers?"
"Do we prefer to reduce these workers to a workforce liable to the corvée?"
"Would ratifying the UN Convention on the protection of migrant workers and members of their families have guaranteed them too many rights?"
"Finally, I ask myself - I ask you - what is the logic in wanting to attract migrant workers into the Union while refusing to regularise those persons already working on our territory, who are working legally and doing so with no residence permit?"
"The Union is embarking on a legal migration policy, but under protest, and it is the utilitarian logic and the exceptions to equal rights decided by each Member State that are liable to assert themselves."
"When are we going to understand - and above all accept - that migration is a chance, an opportunity in terms of human development, in terms of economic and social development, in terms of the development even of countries of the South and in terms of intercultural dialogue, of which we have been making so much this year?"
"(SV) Mr President, through the likes of Frontex, highly vulnerable people are being turned away from the EU and the Union is building walls that are hard for many people in great need of protection to penetrate."
"At the same time it is now being proposed, through the 'Blue Card', to grant certain people special access."
"There would be special access for highly educated workers, with very high requirements in relation to the level of education and professional experience of the person in question, and with a minimum salary that, in Sweden for example, would have to amount to at least SEK 43 000 or EUR 4 300 per month."
"Ordinary workers or people needing protection need not bother, whereas highly educated people - the very people the developing world needs if its countries are to be able to improve their situations domestically - these people are welcome."
"I, for one, welcome openness and immigration, but with the prerequisite that no one is discriminated against on the basis of their country of origin or level of education."
"Mr President, the European Union prefers to import yet more migrant labour rather than try to deal with the problem of those Europeans already unemployed in Member States."
"Successful applicants for the so-called Blue Card work permit, who are allowed to enter one Member State, will be permitted, after 18 months, to move to another Member State."
"This includes their family and dependants."
"This is part of the European Union's emergent common immigration policy, in which it will dictate who can and cannot migrate to Member States and on what terms."
"Britain claims to have an opt-out from this policy, but the Queen has given royal assent to the Lisbon Treaty, and we face the prospect of its full ratification by the other Member States."
"If and when the Lisbon Treaty is fully ratified, Britain's opt-out will prove to be worthless and it is almost certain that we will be forced to comply with this directive."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it is a strategic mistake on Europe's part to think that we should import qualified staff from other nations, and from other continents, when it ought to be our institutions, our schools and our universities training highly qualified workers, in accordance with a new strategic approach."
"Thus, what is missing is an idea of what the future of Europe will be and therefore nobody is thinking of who we will need to call upon over the next ten or fifteen years to lead our high-level factories or facilities."
"We should also say that this will certainly involve a lowering of welfare benefits for those doing these jobs in Italy and other European countries."
"There will be a dumping of salaries, and this is typical of certain immigration policies."
"Furthermore, at a time of dramatic crisis resulting from the financial collapse, it is impossible to imagine that, in addition to our own unemployed, we will have the problem of the unemployed from outside the EU who will, by force of circumstance, pose a problem to civil order and the security of our peoples."
"(RO) 'We are not Fortress Europe,' said Mr Jouyet."
"This is indeed the case, as the two reports we have had this afternoon provide evidence of Europe's openness and that it accepts and supports the process of globalisation."
"I think that this European work permit will resolve the whole range of problems linked to illegal immigration which Europe is facing."
"The US has demonstrated this with the Green Card scheme it launched in the past."
"Europe needs to prove that it is in favour of openness, all the more so as, according to the report, only 5.5% of immigrants headed for the European Union, while 50% of highly qualified immigrants headed for the US or Canada."
"Why are we not an attractive destination?"
"Why is there a large discrepancy between the salaries here and those in the US and Canada, making the lack of attractiveness even more glaring?"
"In the context of the current crisis, it is a gesture of fair play, a normal gesture, on Europe's part, which needs to be balanced with being open to third-country workers."
"However, this policy on European cards needs to be implemented in a logical manner so that it does not cause any serious imbalance or trigger major problems in the countries where the specialists originally come from."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our group is fairly satisfied with these two proposals."
"The fact that we are fairly, not completely, satisfied is demonstrated by the number of amendments by means of which we have tried to help to improve these texts."
"We are also only fairly satisfied because there has been a lack of ambition; we believe that more could have been done, and that it could have been done better."
"There are signs of opening up and of a civilised attitude, which are quickly followed, even at times in the debate within this Parliament, by signs of rigidity, particularly from the Council, and of considerable protectionism."
"This also applies to the Blue Card: there is resistance on some central principles, such as 'equal pay for equal work', which is a sacrosanct, natural principle."
"Even on this, however, we have encountered certain areas of difficulty."
"We believe that it is vital to overcome the principle of Community preference, to overcome the idea that there is a two-speed Europe, which is the reason why it is necessary to make use of the principle of Community preference."
"We believe that reference to the labour market is important, but the labour market cannot be the only governing principle."
"There are other inclusive principles relating to political and social welfare attitudes that ought to form part of immigration policies."
"Legal immigration means equal dignity and equal opportunities, or else we are going back to selective, partial and discriminatory immigration."
"We would like to avoid that."
"For this reason too, on behalf of my group, I support the proposal that Mr Moreno has put to the Commission: let us try to design a Blue Card that is not linked solely to the 3% of highly qualified immigrants, but one that seeks to find specific legal instruments with which to open up the market to immigration."
"Immigration ought to be inclusion."
"If it becomes selection, then it is no longer a positive policy."
"(EL) Mr President, the proposals for a directive and the two reports implement the general immigration policy of the European Union, the aim of which is to secure cheap manpower for European capital in order to increase its profits."
"The directive on the granting of a blue residence and work card in the European Union to highly qualified immigrants allows brainpower to be stolen from poorer countries so that European monopolies can acquire a better position in global competition, especially with the United States of America."
"It does not offer any particular rights or benefits to card holders, because it requires a contract of employment to already be in place."
"Their salary will also be institutionally lower."
"The second directive and report on a standard residence and work permit moves in the same direction."
"Only those who have secured employment will be able to enter the European Union and obtain a permit."
"Thus, immigrants are at the mercy of employers."
"Dismissal will be equivalent to deportment."
"For illegal immigrants, there is the axe of the European Immigration Pact, with 18 months' detention, deportation and a ban on entry for 5 years."
"The overall policy of the European Union legalises the harsh and savage exploitation of immigrants and workers as a whole in the European Union."
"We support the fight by immigrants for equal employment and social rights, the fight to defend and extend workers' rights throughout the European Union."
"(SV) One of the arguments that is put forward for why the EU is not an attractive immigration destination for qualified workers is the fact that there are different entry and residence rules in the different Member States."
"The explanatory statement to this report goes on to say that the differing rules in the Member States actually give rise to competition between the Member States."
"This is said to be a bad thing."
"I would like to say that it is exactly that fact - the fact that the system has not been forced into the straight-jacket of a single format without various solutions being allowed to compete - that has made Europe successful."
"We can see that certain countries have been more successful."
"Sweden, for example, is one of them."
"Sweden has invested in education and language teaching, amongst other things, which has made Sweden one of the most competitive countries, with companies such as Ericsson, Volvo and Ikea."
"The problem of a lack of competitiveness in many of the Member States relates, rather, to the fact that the Union is shot through with protectionism and subsidies for industries that are far from competitive."
"We have gone in for life support rather than focussing on structural changes."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, here is another absurd initiative from the EU: introducing a Blue Card that will promote the entry of immigrant workers, incorrectly referred to as highly qualified."
"According to the rapporteur, this will help to tackle the falling demographic trend."
"She says: 'in Germany, for example, there is a need for 95 000 engineers'; if they were well paid, I am sure that we could send several thousand from Italy."
"This absurd initiative not only uproots qualified staff from developing countries, but ignores the unemployment suffered in Europe by qualified persons, and the justified fears of our young degree and certificate holders, and instead of promoting their entrance into a profession, boosting their capacities for study and research, and ensuring that they have futures that include work and professional qualifications, we are introducing a further cause for doubt, competition and undoubted exploitation."
"The line between foolishness and crime in human action is often a grey one, and it seems to me that the EU is today giving us another example of that."
"(MT) I welcome the report by Ewa Klamt and Patrick Gaubert on the Blue Card and single application procedure."
"This is the first time that we are opening a window, so to speak, on legal migration policy."
"These reports are therefore very relevant, because through them we can build up future policies on this extremely important issue."
"Furthermore, for the first time, this gives immigrants a legal means by which to enter European Union territory, in order to be able to work amongst us."
"However, we must place this within the context of our clear policy."
"As I understand it, the immigration policy that we must align ourselves to has to be based on the rights of the European Union's Member States to retain full control over the number of workers who are granted right of entry."
"As was previously mentioned, we must adhere to the principle of Community preference, whereby European Union citizens are given preference over non-European Union citizens."
"On this basis, I believe that not only can we develop a policy on legal migration that deals with the granting of the Blue Card to highly qualified workers, but that down the line, we can begin work on other proposals that I know the Commission will put forward in the coming months, and which concern the possibility of employment for less qualified workers."
"Our discussions today must also be seen in light of our policies on illegal and not legal immigration."
"I say this because if we fail to be credible on our immigration policy, we cannot expect our citizens to trust us to open up our markets to legal migration."
"I believe the two go hand in hand and should work in parallel with one another, otherwise we will not be able to move forward."
"In the area of illegal immigration policy, there are a number of issues pending that we still have to consider, such as the law on sanctions against employers who illegally employ third country citizens or, effectively, illegal immigrants."
"We need to work upon this law if we want to properly penalise these employers, as this will, in addition, serve as a deterrent to the influx of illegal immigrants."
"There is another proposal that the European Commission has already announced it will be putting forward in the coming weeks."
"This regards the revision of the Dublin law on the responsibility countries must assume when processing asylum applications by immigrants who have already entered their territory."
"We eagerly await the tabling of this proposal."
"To conclude, it would be worth noting that, had the Lisbon Treaty been in force today, the legal basis of these proposals would be different to what we have now."
"The Lisbon Treaty would have breathed new impetus into the European Union so as to come up with a solution in the area of immigration."
"I believe that those who oppose the Lisbon Treaty have no reason to be pleased with the fact that today's current European policy on immigration is not as strong as it should be."
"(FR) Mr President, at European level, we need to equip ourselves with effective immigration tools, and our world requires protection methods to provide help at an early stage to those who are suffering."
"The international community, in general, and Europe, in particular, are unfortunately unprepared, despite living in a century which, with globalisation, will inevitably be one of population movements."
"We absolutely must consider this reality in all our outlooks."
"As for the Blue Card, we must be able to welcome migrant workers, while making sure we do not pillage countries by holding on to the players needed for their development."
"This is why we want to help in the training of highly qualified workers in key sectors, in their countries of origin, and we must promote circular migration."
"I want to end my brief speech by reminding you that we need European solidarity to be extended to the developing countries."
"If we are to talk in terms of feasibility - the ability to react to the current financial crisis attests to this -, if we have the political will, we have the material resources."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, the discussions among the fellow Members are clearly polarised."
"The Right is afraid of illegal immigration on a huge scale."
"Mr Romagnoli is no longer here to take the discussion further."
"The Left is concerned that illegal immigrants will not be able to find employment."
"We do not want either of these things, in other words, neither illegal immigration on a huge scale, nor the employment of illegal immigrants which will give them legal status."
"What we really want to achieve with the Blue Card is a step towards the controlled immigration of highly qualified workers into individual Member States of the European Union."
"The Blue Card and the standardised residence and work permit regulations represent precisely the tool which will allow Member States to react and to bring highly qualified workers into the country just when they need them."
"We are also putting in place standardised rules for issuing the Blue Card and for monitoring it throughout Europe."
"I am pleased that the Council has included my proposal in the implementing rules to label the Blue Card with the symbol of the state which issued the card and to which the work and residence permits apply."
"This means that for Austria, there will be a red, white and red Blue Card and the other states will have a similar solution."
"I believe that the incentive which allows people to start working in another Member State after three years, provided that the requirements have been met and that a need has been identified, is a positive move."
"Another important rule is that the Blue Card will expire when there is obviously no further need for the worker."
"This becomes clear when the worker has been continuously unemployed for more than six months."
"At this point, it is obvious that the worker is no longer needed and the Blue Card then becomes invalid."
"I would like to propose to the Council that workers are required to register with the national authorities when they become unemployed, otherwise it will not be possible to check whether the six-month period has come to an end."
"Finally, I would just like to say that the Blue Card is a tool for the Member States which will allow them to react flexibly."
"It represents an opportunity for the European Union to become and to remain an attractive business location."
"It is an incentive for highly qualified workers to move not to the USA, Canada or Australia, but instead to choose the European Union as the place where they will live and work, at least for a certain period of time."
"I believe that the Blue Card represents a positive step in the direction of controlled immigration based on the requirements, opportunities and needs of the Member States."
"(EL) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, for over a decade now, there has been no substantial debate on how Member States can cooperate in order to make Europe a more attractive destination for the legal immigrants which our communities require and a more humane place for those already living among us."
"The recent 'return directive' which, as we know, treats many poor immigrants as common criminals, is indicative of the almost monomaniacal way in which Europe is focusing on a policing approach to immigration policy."
"The basic reason for this is as follows: most Member States of the European Union have not yet managed, firstly, to apply effective immigrant integration programmes and, secondly, to persuade a large section of the public that the inevitable increase in multicultural communities is a desirable development which promotes our economic and social growth."
"Within this framework, one cannot but welcome the legislative initiatives which we are debating today."
"This is perhaps the first serious effort to create a common European legal immigration policy, despite the relative timidity of some proposals and despite their problems, some of which we have addressed in amendments such as - as many have quite rightly said - the risk of depriving poor countries of their qualified workers."
"At the same time, however, these individual regulations concern a minimum number of what one might call privileged legal immigrants."
"We now need bold legislative initiatives in order to introduce European rules on legal work and for the millions of others whom our economies and communities need."
"(EL) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the European Union is still seen as an unattractive place by highly qualified workers from third countries, while unskilled immigrants arrive in their thousands."
"The European immigration policy therefore needs a broad and consistent general approach to peace and security, European development policy and integration and employment policies."
"The legislative proposal is an effort to lay down common criteria for a fast-track immigration procedure for highly qualified immigrants."
"We need common, uniform definitions for access to 27 labour markets."
"Everyone acknowledges the fact that the European Union needs the facility to use skilled manpower from third countries on a long-term basis in order to improve its competitiveness and boost economic growth."
"However, we need preconditions."
"As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I consider the first precondition to be the recognition of the university education of highly qualified persons or three years' experience."
"Development policy must guarantee the availability of manpower from third countries."
"The rapporteur, with whom I commiserate on the unfortunate occurrence, emphasises that immigration for the purpose of highly qualified employment is not a long-term solution to economic and demographic problems, given that, generally speaking, economic immigration affects national labour markets in the Member States."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be applied until such time as we have uniform social systems and uniform labour legislation."
"The European Parliament therefore recommends strict adherence to the principle of Community preference."
"Member States must determine the numbers of third country immigrants admitted within the framework of their national sovereignty and must also be entitled to set a zero quota."
"Blue Cards should only be issued, even if the preconditions are met, at the discretion of each Member State, with European added value in the form of mobility after two years' legal residence in another Member State."
"(DE) Mr President, in order to bring illegal immigration under control, to meet the challenges represented by demographic change, to increase our competitiveness and, at the same time, to ensure a high level of social harmony, we need a joint immigration policy more urgently than ever."
"This House is in agreement on this point."
"For this reason, I would like to thank all four rapporteurs for their close cooperation."
"However, for my group, a joint immigration policy must include all migrants, otherwise it will fall short of our requirements."
"This means that the principle of equal treatment must apply to everyone without restrictions, in the case of employees' rights, access to education and access to social security systems."
"Therefore, I would ask you to vote in favour of my group's amendments tomorrow."
"The Framework Directive must also apply to seasonal workers, refugees or temporary asylum seekers."
"As far as the Blue Card is concerned, I would like to change the outcome of the vote of the committee responsible tomorrow in order to open up the European labour market not only to migrants from countries with which we already have partnership agreements."
"There must be no restrictions of this kind and it pleases me to hear that the Commission shares this view."
"Finally, another word to the Council."
"In view of the occasion, I urge you to adopt both directives together."
"If we are serious about equal treatment, we cannot adopt the principles of equal treatment first of all just for highly qualified workers and then later perhaps for other migrants."
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Klamt, and the shadow rapporteurs, for an interesting report."
"As a Nordic Social Democrat, I had hoped for your backing so that collective agreements, too, would apply to the EU Blue Card."
"I believe this will be necessary, but I am not particularly alarmed by the fact that it is not to be implemented."
"Parliament should have taken the lead on this, however."
"What is good now is that it is clearly laid down that it is a criminal offence for employers to break the rules and to fail to check whether they are employing illegal workers whilst, at the same time, they may be liable to make up short pay and the like in retrospect."
"It is also good that the citizens of third countries can go home during the period in question and then return to the EU."
"This shows that we are taking third countries' concerns about brain drain seriously."
"I am also satisfied with and support the decision that Member States must take account of national and regional labour markets."
"This shows that those who are already in our home countries and who are unemployed will be first in line for jobs."
"This is particularly important in these days of rising unemployment in the wake of the credit crunch, especially, too, when xenophobia represents a threat to democracy in many of our Member States."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for their spirit of cooperation."
"This directive is the first major text concerning legal immigration."
"It aims to promote the arrival on EU soil of highly qualified workers from third-party countries, the great majority of whom, at present, prefer to go to the United States or Canada."
"Thanks to the Blue Card, these workers will now be able to take advantage of numerous rights for themselves and their families."
"Of course, we run the risk of being accused of supporting the idea of selective immigration, but I wish to point out that it is the Council that is systematically opposed to a horizontal directive applicable to all immigrant workers."
"The Commission therefore had no other option if it was to hope to move forward slightly in the field of legal immigration than to start with highly qualified workers, for whom it knew it would be easier to obtain the agreement of the Member States."
"Obviously I regret this sectoral approach, but we, in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, have for so long been denouncing the exclusively repressive nature of European policy regarding immigration and calling for a legal immigration policy worthy of the name that I feel it is important to validate this first step."
"Let us not forget that other texts are already in the process of being prepared concerning, for example, seasonal workers and trainees."
"(NL) Mr President, an important step has finally been taken."
"Europe is of one mind when it comes to conditions for a single system for recruiting top people."
"This is the added value this card offers."
"This step is a necessary one, even though, in my view, it is just the first one."
"Once we have gathered some experience with the Blue Card, we must look at subsequent steps in the next term."
"We must not forget that we live in turbulent times."
"There may well be redundancies in the short term as a result of the financial crisis."
"This is why it is important that the Blue Card system, as described in Mrs Klamt's report, leaves room for policy from national Member States."
"The Member States must be able to decide how many migrants with sound qualifications are needed and to set to work in their countries without causing a brain drain in sensitive sectors, such as health care, in the third countries."
"We should also look ahead though."
"Europe desperately needs migrants with sound qualifications."
"This is why the best solution is the simplest possible arrangement for the Blue Card by which actual talents are attracted."
"I think this solution is included in the present proposal, thanks in part to the amendments by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Accordingly, it is important for people who are already residing legally in the EU not to have to return to their home countries first in order to apply for a Blue Card for an EU Member State if they meet the other conditions."
"(DE) Mr President, within the next 20 years, the European Union will need more highly qualified workers from third countries."
"Other states have been making disproportionate use of the potential in this area for years."
"The regulations produced by the EU are balanced and are intended to prevent the brain drain from third countries."
"The requirements at any given time will be determined by the Member States."
"This all sounds very sensible but, on the other hand, we are currently threatened by recession because of the financial and economic crisis."
"Unemployment will increase throughout Europe and some Member States already want to restrict the freedom of movement of workers within the European Union even further."
"Would it not be more sensible, in a situation in which we are being forced to change our industrial policy because of environmental issues, to invest in more and better training programmes for highly qualified employees who have significant potential for innovation?"
"We must focus all our efforts on this issue instead of poaching top employees from third countries."
"That alone will not be enough to secure our future in the long term."
"(PL) Mr President, we all remember the labour camps opened in the autumn of 2006 in several European Union Member States."
"In those camps, illegal immigrants worked in terrible conditions side by side with citizens of European Union Member States."
"This situation pushed forward our work on the immigration package, some of which we are discussing today."
"It seems to me that we are moving in the right direction."
"The proposal makes for more civilised working conditions and simplifies the rules governing the employment and residence of legal immigrants."
"As a Polish woman, I would also like to emphasise our solidarity with third country citizens legally residing in the European Union."
"We must not discriminate against them."
"Nor do I think that the Blue Card will threaten the economic interests of the citizens of the new Member States, or constitute competition for them."
"The fact is that most European labour markets are now open to us, and, as is well known, all transition periods will end before the Blue Card comes into effect."
"(LT) Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world is becoming more and more open, not just Europe."
"Modern technologies and globalisation make it such and fighting this reality is counterproductive."
"I congratulate France which, during its Presidency, took the important initiatives we are discussing today."
"The interest of the European Union is clear: we lack, we need workers, as well as highly qualified specialists, because our citizens use their right to leave, live and work elsewhere, somewhere they prefer."
"Legal immigration into the EU is a completely acceptable solution to the problem."
"It is also our response to the challenges of globalisation and the EU aim of becoming more competitive."
"I agree that the proposals must be coordinated with each other, coordinated with other legal acts, but there is no doubt that we had to solve these problems and I once again congratulate both rapporteurs and the presiding country."
"(RO) The draft resolution which aims to introduce the Blue Card for highly qualified immigrants is intended to attract a highly qualified professional workforce from outside the European Union, offering these immigrants the chance to settle and work legally in the European Union."
"This initiative is beneficial in the situation where it is anticipated that during the next 20 years, there is a risk that 20 million jobs will remain unfilled."
"However, I would like to remind you that Romanian and Bulgarian citizens still face restrictions on the labour market, with fears already that some countries are going to extend the transitional period for another three years."
"This is why, against this background, it is vitally important that we do not add to the discrimination against European citizens as well."
"(PL) Mr President, demographic changes in the European Union and the ageing population are circumstances causing a demand for skilled workers from outside European Union countries."
"Economic migration is a challenge which must be met by the European Union in a rapidly globalising world."
"It is my view that Member States must develop an integrated and coherent approach to European migration policy."
"Engineering and computer technology are areas which must be given special attention within the context of development and employment."
"The adoption of Community regulations is necessary if we are to restrict illegal immigration."
"I agree with the rapporteur and with the consultant, Mr Masiel, and support the introduction of the European Blue Card scheme for skilled immigrants, intended to facilitate employment of skilled workers from third countries."
"(CS) The mobility of persons from third countries within the territory of Member States of the European Union presents a major challenge for Europe in a globalised world dominated by tough economic competition."
"We are adopting common European rules making it possible to manage migrant flows into Europe and to limit illegal migration."
"It is right to welcome the Commission's suggestion to speed up the reception process for workers and to provide them with better conditions of residence in order to increase the attractiveness of the EU to highly qualified workers from third countries."
"The deciding factor is not only a rapid reception process for workers, free of bureaucratic obstacles, but common and unified conditions of access for all of the 27 different labour markets."
"Whilst debating both reports, one must mention that in the EU, barriers to the employment of people from new Member States still exist."
"Mr President, the European Union Blue Card is a much-appreciated initiative from the position of the developing countries."
"As the EU Blue Card will be issued by the Member States, one might speculate that a Member State may far too often find, after examination of its labour market, that it is not in a situation which allows the facilitation of foreign labour, or that a Member State's public policy poses some obstacles to the full implementation of the EU Blue Card policy."
"I am afraid that some Member States may undermine the purpose of the EU Blue Card."
"The EU Blue Card has not been created only to satisfy the labour demand of Member States, but also to start 'brain circulation'."
"In a way it is a supportive measure to the EU development cooperation policy, as the Blue Card workers eventually return to their countries of origin with the experience that is vital for progress."
"(RO) I believe that it is extremely important for the European Union to become more attractive to highly qualified workers, especially bearing in mind that the majority of immigrants at the moment are unqualified."
"These workers need to enjoy favourable conditions, a harmonised system for regulating emigration, and movement from one country to another, as well as salaries which reflect their qualifications."
"The European Blue Card must also be seen as a way of discouraging illegal immigration, as part of the agreement for immigration and asylum, as well as part of the solution to the problem of the labour shortage which will affect the European Union in the coming decades."
"I would like to focus on the notion that citizens from the new Member States must not be in an inferior position to those from third countries."
"It is not acceptable for some states to keep their labour market closed to citizens from the new Member States but, on the other hand, offer jobs requiring high qualifications to workers from countries which are not EU members."
"(PL) Demographic problems and the ageing of the European population are not the only reasons why the Blue Card should be introduced as an instrument controlled by the EU."
"The enlargement of the EU was followed by a huge outflow of specialists from new Member States."
"The outflow of skilled workers is today the greatest problem for employers, holding up investment and thus restricting economic development."
"If our companies cannot find skilled workers in their domestic markets, they will lose out to Chinese competition."
"Polish employers want a broader opening up of the labour market."
"They are willing to employ workers from countries such as Ukraine and Belarus."
"At the same time, we should remember that all benefits must be consistent within the EU."
"We must remember that some of those who will come to us under the Blue Card scheme will return home, taking with them the experience they have gained in the EU."
"We must work simultaneously to strengthen the education and continued development schemes for specialists needed by the labour markets in our Member States."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to draw attention to two dangers which have emerged during the debate and in proposed regulations."
"First, the excessive requirements for third country citizens taking up employment here."
"The requirement of at least two of five years of professional experience being in a managerial position seems to me to be definitely too high."
"In the case of a nurse or an IT specialist, this is not needed to enable them to play a useful role in our companies."
"The other danger is the attempt to set a uniform minimum rate for the workers."
"This regulation is certain to destroy the basic principle which really should apply, that of equal pay for equal work, since it could result in someone coming to the EU to work earning more than someone who is working here already."
"Mr President, this rich debate shows the quality of the reports made."
"I would once again like to thank the rapporteurs and the draftsmen of the opinion, Mr Masiel, Mrs Jeleva and Mrs Panayotopoulos, and say that, indeed, as our debates have shown, this is a great step forward for agreement on legal immigration."
"Four years ago, no one wanted to hear about community tools."
"We know that in a few years' time, we will be able to go further."
"I also congratulate the Commission, through Mr Barrot, who was able to launch this debate and ensure that our ambitions in this area grew rapidly."
"Well done to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs too."
"Mr Deprez found the right words, balance and the voice of reason; he supports an open Europe and I welcome that."
"One or two nuances aside, Mrs Roure also wants Europe to be ready for the century of population movements, which is what we are trying to achieve."
"As Mrs Lefrançois pointed out, these two texts are a start and not an end, and do leave room for circular migrations."
"On the question of Community preference as raised by Mrs Grabowska and Mrs Gál, and by Mr Fava and Mr Catania, in particular, I would point out that the Blue Card will not apply until 2011, by which time the transitional measures of the accession treaties will have come to an end, and that it offers a status that is not equivalent to the status of EU citizens."
"Furthermore, we are ready and wish to include in the text the principle of Community preference enshrined in the accession treaties."
"As for the numerous remarks about the brain drain - in particular those of Mr Kreissl-Dörfler and Mr Borghezio, Mrs Budreikaitė, Mr Moreno, Mrs Lambert and Mrs Roure, I believe the European Parliament has expressed its legitimate concerns about including in the Blue Card safeguards to transform the brain drain into a brain gain, and it seems to me that there are three main ways to do this."
"First of all, the directive does not, in any way, prevail over European agreements or agreements between certain Member States and the countries of origin, who draw up lists of professions to be excluded from its scope to ensure ethical recruitment in sectors hit by a labour shortage."
"Secondly, Member States must be offered responsibility in the context of case-by-case examination: they must be able to reject a Blue Card request to ensure ethical recruitment."
"Finally, the directive must be able to promote the circular migration of highly qualified workers and, of course, emphasise, as has already been pointed out, the requirements for training in the country of origin."
"On the other hand, it does not seem to me necessary to prevent issuance of Blue Cards systematically if there is no agreement with the country of origin."
"As Mr Barrot pointed out, I think that this would create discrimination and transfer the requests to national systems, and that it is therefore preferable to negotiate on a case by case basis."
"Concerning the distinction made between highly qualified workers and unskilled workers, a subject mentioned by Mr Busuttil and Mrs Lefrançois, in particular, and by Mrs Lambert, I believe we must move forward by stages."
"At present, there is unfortunately no consensus on legal migration to act at Community level on all labour market segments."
"Nonetheless, we are moving forward since there is a single set of rights for all third-party workers in the European Union, and we must start with the highly qualified, seasonal, posted and trainee workers."
"The Stockholm programme may enable us to make progress."
"Contrary to what was stated by Mrs Flautre and other speakers, the rights guaranteed by the Blue Card do not include any restrictions regarding freedom of association or the rights attached to employment, quite the opposite, and this Blue Card will be the only tool allowing migrants to exercise a right to mobility to undertake qualified professional work in the European Union, which is not possible today via national systems."
"This is the major advantage of this text."
"Also, to answer Mr Pirker regarding the period after which these benefits will cease in the event of unemployment - it is true there is a three month period - the Presidency of the European Union would have liked this period to be longer than what is proposed, but no consensus was reached in this area."
"Indeed, some Member States even wanted there to be no period at all, which, clearly, was not the wish expressed by the Presidency."
"Finally, to answer Mr Fava, recital 16 of the Council text does include the principle of equal treatment in terms of pay for third-country workers and Community nationals for equal work. This is implemented by Article 15(1) of the same text."
"Mr President, I am going to confine myself to completing the remarks of Mr Jouyet, that seem to me, this afternoon, to well present our mutual interest in your work."
"I would like to thank all the speakers and all the rapporteurs, who have done a good job."
"I should just like to state again that the draft directive respects Community preference fully."
"Moreover, this Community preference is enshrined in the European Union accession treaties and the treaties state that if a Member State applies temporary restrictions on the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of another Member State, it must grant them priority, in terms of access to the labour market, over workers who are third-country nationals."
"I say this for the benefit of Members from new Member States as this must be emphasised."
"Next, I also need in turn to reply to those who are concerned by the risks of a brain drain."
"I would remind you that the proposal recommends a clause on ethical recruitment in order to restrict and even ban active advertising that might be undertaken by Member States in developing countries, which are already facing a serious brain drain."
"In this proposal, there is also the possibility for a Member State to reject Blue Card applications based on ethical recruitment considerations."
"We have measures intended to make circular migration easier and we have an obligation, for Member States, to provide the Commission with annual statistics on the application of the directive to enable it to monitor the impact of this legislation."
"It is true that we must avoid active recruitment in countries suffering from acute shortages, especially in the health sector in Africa, and all this will find its solution in the development of partnerships with the countries of origin."
"Thirdly, I obviously want to say that this text will be followed by other proposals from the Commission."
"In March next year, I shall be presenting a text on legal migration for seasonal workers, paid trainees and employees in plurinational or multinational groups who may be transferred."
"Here too, as Mrs Lefrançois said, this is a start and we must continue towards a complete framework for legal immigration."
"I too, shall just repeat what Mr Jouyet said so well, that there is a very definite desire to treat all these immigrants and new arrivals in the European Union with equal rights which, once again, also reflects the ideal of our European Community."
"In any case, I have taken note of many comments and remarks."
"During the coming months, we shall be having further discussions on these migratory issues."
"Indeed, I feel that we must get used to dealing with them dispassionately, with great objectivity and with a great sense of justice, while recognising that we also need immigration, but an immigration which, specifically, is covered by a legal framework that is reliable and fair for all."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say first of all that I am happy to convey to Ewa Klamt your best wishes and also your sympathy."
"I would also like to thank you for the debate and to emphasise three points."
"Firstly, I would like to repudiate the nationalistic rhetoric which we have heard in some cases today."
"This definitely does not represent the opinion of the majority of Members of this House and should be rejected out of hand."
"Secondly, I would, of course, like to refer to the question of legal immigration, which we need in order to ensure that our national economies retain their innovative abilities, and to the fight against illegal immigration, which are two sides of the same coin."
"The citizens of Europe expect us both to be open to immigration which is useful and legal and also to combat illegal immigration."
"Thirdly, this was to be expected when it came to the question of the Blue Card, but I would also like to say that this is a positive first step towards presenting a common image throughout the world."
"For this reason, I believe that we should take this step together, so that we can move one step further along the way."
"Let us vote in favour of this legislation tomorrow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have heard a number of things ..."
"I shall begin by talking about the debate."
"The debate was quite interesting."
"I shall not quote anyone, but will say that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has no need for lessons where respect for human rights is concerned."
"The PPE-DE Group is happy that Europe is able to reach agreement on common instruments relative to managing migratory flows, as it is also happy that Europe is not turning in on itself."
"We have a migratory policy that is both humane and firm; humane because it rejects the disgraceful living conditions of the illegal immigrants who are living in our countries - we are doing all we can to stop men and women boarding boats and risking their lives - and firm because it condemns the traffickers and rogue bosses."
"Concerning the Blue Card and the residence permit single procedure, I say to our friend Mr Catania that we need the elite and the others in our countries."
"As we are on the subject, the rights of legal immigrants will be the same as those of Community citizens, neither more nor less."
"Europe has no need to redeem itself with respect to others insofar as its migratory policies are concerned."
"Europe does not consider immigrants as crooks or criminals or as a threat to our security or workforce."
"They are men, women and children, flesh and blood, seeking a better life on our territory, because at home they have nothing."
"Our common aim is to help and support them, even if this means encouraging them to stay in their countries."
"Our migratory policy is dignified, open, perhaps security conscious, but for them, and for us, we can be proud of this policy - as we can take pride tomorrow when voting on these two reports on Europe's migratory policy."
"I should like to express my personal condolences to Ms Klamt on the sudden loss of her father last week."
"I saw her shortly after she had heard the news, so my sympathy goes out to her."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 20 November."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"First of all, I welcome both the Commission's initiative and the rapporteur's position as I feel that substantial progress has been made on the migration of highly qualified workers, which is essential to achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"However, I believe that the EU needs to be attractive not only to highly qualified workers from third countries, but also to young Europeans."
"Bearing in mind that the EU's competitiveness is at stake, we do not want to see either a brain drain in favour of the US or Canada to the detriment of the EU."
"Consequently, the current initiative needs to be consolidated by a policy to encourage young Europeans."
"Furthermore, we need to implement this measure with special care and responsibility, taking into account the situation in terms of human resources in certain fields in the countries these migrants originate from, so as not to deepen the human resources crisis further, particularly in the education and health sectors."
"Finally, I support Mrs Klamt's position with regard to applying Community preference during the recruitment process and to the idea of giving priority to citizens from the new Member States who are still subject to restrictions concerning access to the labour market."
"If these restrictions need to be retained, granting priority seems to me to be a minimum condition for ensuring that citizens from these countries do not feel like second-class European citizens."
"I would like to draw your attention to certain provisions which may have a discriminatory impact and therefore, I would ask you to consider granting priority to citizens from the EU's new Member States in terms of access to the EU labour market, in relation to immigrants who have come from outside these countries."
"The 'Blue Card' initiative is beneficial as it will partially resolve the problem of the shortage of highly qualified workers and may play an important role in reducing illegal immigration."
"However, there are also provisions which put the citizens from the countries which recently joined the European Union at a disadvantage."
"In a situation where access to the labour market in most of the EU's states is still restricted for Romanians, either totally or in certain areas, I feel that it is necessary to oblige Member States to reject Blue Card applications for those sectors in which access for workers from the countries which have recently joined the EU is still restricted by the current transitional provisions."
"Inhabitants of EU States, even if they only joined recently, must be given priority over those from outside the EU."
"I also need to warn about the risk of a brain drain from underdeveloped countries, which will affect key sectors in these countries, such as health, education and research, giving rise to a boomerang effect with complex implications at a global level."
"With regard to the establishment of 'conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment' in the EU (the 'Blue Card') and the creation of a 'single application procedure for residence and work', we consider, among other worrying aspects, that these initiatives must be viewed in the context of the EU's overall immigration policy."
"In other words, they only make sense and their full scope is only revealed if they are integrated within the other pillars of this policy, as reaffirmed in the 'European Pact on Immigration and Asylum': criminalisation of immigrants, detention centres, 'return' directive; border control, creation of Frontex; 'readmission agreements' as a clause of 'cooperation' agreements."
"By introducing discrimination between immigrants, this 'Blue Card' seeks to respond to the neoliberal objectives of the 'Lisbon Strategy' and to the EU's labour needs (set by quotas), thus reducing immigrants to 'labour', promoting the plundering of human resources from third countries - particularly their most qualified workers - and implementing dangerous centralised systems in the EU for the storage and collection of data on immigrants."
"In other words, the 'Blue Card' and the 'single procedure' form one pillar of the EU's inhumane immigration policy which criminalises and expels or exploits and discards immigrants."
"Immigration has long been one of the most important economic and social issues in the European Union."
"In an ageing Europe, everybody agrees on the need for reinforcements to the labour force in order to maintain and boost our competitiveness."
"Promoting immigration as a joint response requires not only regulation by the EU, but an even-handed strategy that takes into consideration sustainable development and social equilibrium in equal measure."
"Mrs Klamt's report on the European Blue Card is to be commended because it lays down more acceptable conditions of employment for highly qualified workers from third countries, taking into account family circumstances as well as their possible temporary return home."
"I am especially pleased, however, that we are dealing with this matter alongside the Gaubert report on the single permit for residence and work, so that we can avoid even the appearance of opening Europe's doors just to highly qualified workers."
"For the sake of the EU's internal social equilibrium, we need to think through the extent to which a financial and economic crisis like the current one impacts on Europe's interests."
"Rising unemployment in itself leads to social tension, and so we must prevent further heightening of existing domestic ethnic and racial tensions through immigration."
"This may not only fuel the growth of the far right but, in the long run, may be a source of animosity towards the EU - in spite of the fact that the European Union played nothing but a stabilising role in the crisis."
"The introduction of the Blue Card, which the EU needs because it is facing a shortage of highly qualified workers in certain sectors, is a step forward for the economic migration of highly qualified workers from third countries."
"However, the Blue Card may represent a step backwards if Member States are not going to reject applications for exemptions from this for those sectors of the labour market where access is restricted for workers from the new Member States, based on the transitional measures provided for in the accession treaties."
"I feel I need to remind you that the UK and Ireland have already expressed the desire to maintain the labour market restrictions for Romania and Bulgaria for another three years."
"I would like to stress that applying the Blue Card directive policy would disadvantage European citizens in relation to those from third countries."
"Although this directive refers to the principle of Community preference, it is obvious that this cannot be applied to those European citizens who are subject to restrictions in certain sectors of the European labour market."
"Please vote for the amendment on this clarification so that we do not end up in a situation where economic migration from third countries takes precedence over the free movement between states within the EU."
"The logical desire of new Member States is not to feel like second-class EU members."
"in writing. - (ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the Blue Card will relieve several labour and immigration problems."
"The Blue Card is a so-called 'carrot' in the struggle against illegal immigration."
"By promoting and facilitating legal immigration, Europe will not only be combating the shortage of specialists, but also the trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration."
"I support the idea that Member States must have the right to decide how many cards they wish to issue each year."
"At the same time, we should not become protectionist due to the present economic crisis."
"We must be prepared to receive highly qualified workers from third countries."
"We should not close the door to talented citizens of third countries as a result of the present economic recession."
"We need a uniform approach in order to remain internationally competitive."
"The European Union system of 27 different permits is an obstruction to 'brains' coming to work in Europe."
"A uniform system may be one solution that would help surmount the present period of recession, not to mention the improvement in competitiveness today and, especially, in the future."
"Europe now needs, and will need in the future, both a more and less trained workforce from beyond the borders of the EU."
"For the EU to be able to compete with the United States of America for trained and educated immigrants, the Union needs to become a more attractive prospect."
"Facilitating the mobility of workers from outside is a step in the right direction for the EU, and so I would like to thank Mrs Klamt for her commendable report."
"The Blue Card would enhance the mobility of trained workers from third countries in the EU."
"Making the EU a more enticing place to work in should not be allowed to happen, however, at the expense of developing countries."
"Unfortunately, the brain drain often takes the skills and know-how needed for development away from those countries, and when the EU makes the new rules, it should take this problem clearly into account."
"There also needs to be active continued development of higher education in Europe, however, even if it is easy to acquire trained and educated people from elsewhere."
"The new rules for immigrants must not result in any significant inequality between third country and EU nationals."
"Parliament's strict definitions of a professional workforce will create a scenario of inequality if unreasonable demands are made of those coming in from third countries in terms of their educational and employment background."
"The dearth of labour is threatening the European Union as a whole, and not just in the highly trained sectors."
"The EU should therefore extend the scheme for facilitating the movement of a workforce from third countries to the entire spectrum of workers, instead of skimming the cream off the top of the cake."
"The demographic deficit and ageing of the European Union's population put us at risk of the labour market, health care and pension systems being jeopardised."
"In this situation, the Blue Card will act as a counterbalance to the US Green Card system, which has proven to be a real success, bearing in mind that approximately 50% of highly qualified workers choose either the US or Canadian market."
"I believe that it is vital for us to have a uniform immigration system for all 27 Member States so that every state in the European Union can benefit from the added value contributed by a highly qualified workforce."
"It seems to me just as important that the EU gives these professionals the recognition they are due by offering them fair and non-discriminatory salaries."
"Before I end, I would very much like to mention the fact, however, that the EU's labour market is not fully open yet to workers from the new Member States."
"We therefore need to be very careful that the measures we adopt do not discriminate against de facto citizens of the European Union."
"There are two problems that concern me in connection with the Blue Card."
"From the European point of view, the inflow of brains is excellent."
"In comparison with America, Australia or Canada, the number of specialists that have come to our country is significantly smaller."
"Such 'enticement' is, however, in conflict with our other principle, which speaks of the fact that the issue of migration must be resolved globally, and that the economic development of third countries must be assisted, in order to reduce migration, particularly illegal migration."
"Whether we wish to admit it or not, the 'brains' that we dream of here are needed in third countries in order to promote life there."
"From the European perspective, in which there is strong competition, it would naturally be favourable to acquire new specialists, all the more so given that research shows that their integration into a new society is a much easier and quicker process."
"This is not a secondary issue either."
"Another problem that I see is that in connection with economic difficulties and increasing unemployment, the negative attitude towards migrants will become even more acute."
"And I also fear that EU internal immigration."
"I do, however, hope that supporters of far right-wing political parties do not take advantage of this, and that the restrictions that now apply to some Member States will be removed in the near future."
"The EU as a whole would benefit from this."
"European Space Policy: How to bring space down to earth (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Council (B6-0482/2008) by Mr Pribetich, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the European space policy: How to bring space down to earth, and"
"the oral question to the Commission (B6-0483/2008) by Mr Pribetich, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the European space policy: How to bring space down to earth."
"As a native of Toulouse, I am delighted to chair this debate."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, Minister, 'it is high time to rekindle the stars'."
"I wanted to begin my speech with this line from a Guillaume Apollinaire poem, to emphasise the importance for the European Parliament of relaunching its space policy."
"For more than thirty years, the European Union and its Member States have worked together in financing, drawing up and developing space policy."
"Alas, this policy has progressively lost its luminescence and radiance."
"It is true that in 2003, the foundations of a European space policy were set out by the EC-ESA framework agreement."
"It is also true that the 'Space' Council of 22 May 2007 was in line with the political continuum of this framework agreement."
"However, the light emitted by this star remains insufficient."
"For Europe's independence, its role on the international stage, its security and prosperity all come together to make this major policy an incomparable trump card for an industrial policy that creates both jobs and stimulates growth; an ambitious policy for cultural, economic and scientific influence that is reinforced on the international stage and is an essential vehicle for society to acquire the knowledge that we wish to gain."
"In the institutional triangle of the Union, and to ensure that this does not turn into a Bermuda triangle, the European Parliament, on behalf of European citizens, must play an important and increased role in the drawing up and definition of this policy."
"It is high time to rekindle the stars."
"On 26 September 2008, the Council participated in this act and we want to make our mark on this policy."
"Of course, this address here and now on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is made in this same spirit."
"To follow the correct route, it seems to me essential to remember the fundamental elements in the creation of this space policy."
"Firstly, there is the question of the budget."
"We call for, from this point onwards, the creation of a specific budget line to reflect and demonstrate our commitment to European space policy."
"The space industries need sufficient public support to increase their research and development capacity and, quite simply, to remain profitable."
"International competition is hard and fierce."
"Whilst the United States, Russia, Japan and even India are significantly increasing their budget dedicated to the space industry, and multiplying public orders, us Europeans are still searching for the appropriate funding to achieve our ambitious aims like others search for lost time."
"Consequently, what initiatives can the Commission take to improve the contribution to the European space sector, and be not just an actor, but the major actor responding to this growing, global demand, across all aspects of space policy from beginning to end?"
"The second point is the issue of strategic options for those applications linked, on the one hand, to Galileo and EGNOS and, on the other, to GMES, through the prism of governance to create an efficient structure generating a clear governance for a reinforced efficiency across all European space programmes."
"The final issue is the exploration of space."
"What is the long-term vision for our European space policy, and for what ends does it exist?"
"Embarking on the long-distance conquest of space is a project for several decades and requires both long-term vision and ambition"
"At this point, I see an echo of the speech made by President Kennedy, focusing the American people on a new uncrossed frontier."
"Made sacred on 21 July 1969, this step was, without a doubt, in the technological history of our civilisation, the most fabulous catalyst for progress for all space-related and even everyday industries."
"Give us, in this concert of nations, this long term vision."
"Here we find ourselves at a milestone on this long journey."
"Europe is at a crossroads with regard to space policy."
"Space has, from now on, multiplied its spheres of action and application."
"From scientific to defence activities, space covers sectors of activity as vast and as varied as environmental protection or the development of SMEs."
"Let us get closer to users and increase the viability and quality of the collected data."
"Let us become the leaders in the space market."
"It is a duty that we owe to future generations to fortify this European space policy and make the vital choices to place into orbit an avant-garde and futuristic Europe for subsequent generations to live in."
"Space is our new European frontier."
"The great history book lies open with its dizzying array of blank pages."
"Europe must not only play a part in it, but be the major actor."
"Therefore, it is high time to rekindle the stars."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Verheugen, honourable Members, your speech, Mr Pribetich, and questioning are particularly pertinent and given the élan with which you have posed and supported them, your speech will be particularly difficult to follow."
"They are pertinent, because space has become, as you have pointed out, an essential tool for all European countries."
"These missions contribute to our acquisition of knowledge, whether this concerns the observation of the earth or oceanography or meteorology by satellite."
"It also corresponds to the growth of our economies through satellite telecommunications and navigation."
"It has become, in a discrete yet essential way, an integral instrument for modern life."
"Space is also a tool, as you have indicated, that allows Europe to be united around a common ambition and to develop a European identity."
"It is in this spirit, therefore, that the French Presidency organised, last July, with Valérie Pécresse, the first informal meeting of European space ministers at Kourou which, as you know, is the European spaceport."
"I know that the European Parliament was represented by Mr Rovsing at this event, and I thank him for that."
"This meeting allowed us to set out a common vision for Europe in space built around the three principal actors of European space policy: the Union, the European Space Agency, and the Member States - while recognising the Union's increased responsibilities."
"Together, these three actors will make Europe one of the main space powers on the international stage, of that we are certain."
"To develop a European space policy of benefit to all Europeans, first of all we need to guarantee open and equal access for all Member States of the Union to the advantages that are brought by space activities."
"Secondly, we must reinforce existing coordination mechanisms in the space sector, European expertise and investments financed by both the Community and by intergovernmental and national sources."
"Finally, it is necessary to improve the synergy between civil and defence space programmes."
"Therefore the Union, the European Space Agency and the Member States will ensure that we benefit from an access to space that is autonomous, viable and at the best price, which is necessary with regard to our biggest partners."
"Of course, this requires a reinforcing of the role of the European Union in the sphere of European space policy."
"It is for the Union to unite demand for space applications, to take stock of users' requirements, to establish priorities and to look after the continuity of services."
"Also, at Union level, we have developed instruments and Community financial schemes to take into account the characteristics of the space sector with respect, in particular, to forthcoming financial perspectives."
"The 'Space' Council that took place on 26 September made it possible to send into orbit, if I dare say, and to confirm the importance of the two flagship programmes, Galileo EGNOS and GMES."
"With regard to Galileo EGNOS, the European Union can congratulate itself on having signed a significant number of cooperation agreements with third countries such as the United States, China, Israel, South Korea, Ukraine and Morocco."
"This same Council of 26 September underlined the importance of increasing the coordination between the Commission, the European Space Agency and the Member States in the sphere of research and development, notably for satellite navigation systems."
"With regard to the GMES programme, the forthcoming Councils on 1 and 2 December are expected to set out the applicable lines and define the terms of the partnership between the Union and the Member States and to lay down legislative proposals formalising the programme before the end of 2009."
"I can already inform you that the Council believes that an approach based on the public good must be maintained for this programme to develop successfully."
"Furthermore, a data policy must also be put into place swiftly."
"Finally, there must be four priorities that have also been cited by Mr Pribetich: the first concerns space and climate change, inasmuch as the contribution of space applications is unique in this sphere."
"The second is the contribution of space activities to the Lisbon strategy."
"The third covers space and security with respect to having monitoring and surveillance of European space infrastructures and space debris at European level."
"Finally, the fourth priority remains space exploration, this is a political and planetary policy and Europe should act within the framework of a worldwide programme."
"In this respect, Europe must develop a common vision and a long-term strategic plan and must also have the necessary political dialogue with other states within an enlarged framework of international cooperation and, in this respect, the Council is very pleased that the Commission has announced that it will be organising a high level political conference in 2009 concerning the long-term worldwide vision for space exploration."
"And so, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this renewed vision of European space policy demonstrates a new commitment from the Member States, a commitment that, in the interests of unprecedented European ambition, I have no doubt will resonate across your House."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I am very grateful to Mr Pribetich for giving me the opportunity to begin a speech on a highly technical subject with a line from a poem by my favourite French poet Guillaume Apollinaire: 'Il est grand temps de rallumer les étoiles.'"
"I believe that the French Presidency has already taken considerable steps towards giving European space policy the importance which it genuinely deserves."
"We have made major progress in recent years and, for the first time, we have a European space policy, which we have never had before."
"We have a framework for a common European policy in which the Commission plays a coordinating role."
"We have achieved a high level of agreement on the strategic, environmental and economic importance of the space policy for Europe."
"No one opposes this."
"I would like to highlight specifically the meeting of the European Space Council at the end of July at the Kourou Space Centre in French Guiana, where, for the first time, it became clear that Europe is ready for this new departure into space."
"We have also been able to demonstrate that the European space industry is highly competitive."
"When we compare the money which Europe can spend on activities in space with that which our American friends spend, for example, we are in a good position."
"Europe plays a leading role in satellite technology and in carrier rocket technology."
"We have the best carrier rocket systems in the world."
"In Kourou, we have an infrastructure which is not to be found anywhere else in the world."
"Our contribution to the International Space Station in the form of the space laboratory demonstrates the high level of European space technology."
"I am also very pleased that the ESA has carried out a whole series of successful research expeditions within our solar system which other countries have not been able to achieve."
"As Europeans, we have absolutely no reason for hiding behind others."
"The collaboration between the European Commission and the ESA is excellent and the division of work is functioning smoothly."
"Against the background of this effective cooperation, there is not the slightest reason to consider changing the structures in this area."
"However, there are problems which we still have to solve."
"As Europeans, we have no independent access to space."
"We cannot send people into space or bring them back again."
"We have to decide whether or not we want to be dependent on others in the long term."
"I do not want to hide my own opinion from you."
"Europe needs an independent and secure means of access to space."
"We will also have to consider what form the next major missions to research the solar system should take."
"In my opinion, the next large-scale missions can only be regarded as tasks carried out on behalf of the whole of the human race."
"We should avoid all types of national or regional competition."
"In any case, our policy aims to achieve the highest possible level of cooperation."
"This will be the subject of the conference which Mr Jouyet has just been speaking about and which the Commission is organising next year."
"To ensure that it is clear to everyone, we want to discuss what will be the next major mission that goes beyond the pure technical application of space-based technologies."
"What is the next large-scale mission, the next major objective which will satisfy the human urge to explore space?"
"Space-based technology is completely indispensable to our civilisation, our security and our economy."
"You only need to think of all our communication technology or the financial markets, which would not function at all without satellites."
"It is right that there should be a strong security component to this policy."
"We are not trying to ignore that."
"We have been able to establish a regular and structured dialogue between the Council and the Commission, which includes the European Defence Agency and the EU Satellite Centre."
"This dialogue is intended to result in improved coordination between civilian, security and defence-related space activities."
"From the perspective of the environment, the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) system, which is currently under development, represents the European response to the global environmental crisis."
"This system will provide us with the data and information we need to act and react with foresight when disasters occur."
"Of course, our two flagship projects - GMES and Galileo - are making an important contribution to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy by ensuring that there is a strong industrial and technological basis in Europe for space-based applications."
"As far as GMES is concerned, I am very pleased to be able to tell you that, only a few days ago, the Commission accepted a communication at my suggestion which relates to the organisation of the funding and the questions of cooperation with GMES."
"The Competitiveness Council will be looking at this in a few days."
"It is true to say that GMES is on the right track."
"The first demonstration projects have started and, as far as I can see, we will be able to meet the schedule."
"We are in full agreement with the ESA about the space-based infrastructure of GMES."
"The ESA has already made good progress on the development of the European satellites which we need for this system, so the prospects are good."
"However, one thing still needs to be resolved."
"The Community budget only provides research funding for GMES."
"We have no operational funds."
"Next year, we will need a small amount of operational funding for the first time and this has already been cleared with the budgetary authority."
"However, we need to find a long-term solution, because it is clear that GMES is not a system which will fund itself."
"It will generate an income, but this will never cover the costs."
"GMES is a European infrastructure project and this is how we need to look at it in order to ensure that long-term funding is available."
"Next year, we will draw up an accurate schedule and action plan for the future implementation of the GMES initiative."
"In summary, in 2009 the Commission will present a proposal for financing the initial deployment of GMES in 2011 on the basis of a detailed impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis."
"Galileo has already been discussed."
"I simply want to say here that, as a result of the effective cooperation between the institutions, the Galileo and EGNOS programmes now have a solid legal basis and can be put into operation."
"The implementation of Galileo and EGNOS also forms part of the plan but, of course, we need to find out whether the requirement in the GNSS Regulation to complete the Galileo system by 2013 can also be met by industry."
"This will become clear in the course of the tendering procedure."
"I would like to urge the European space industry to make use of the major opportunity presented by Galileo, to work together with us as closely as possible and to mobilise all of its resources."
"For us, Galileo is one of the most important, if not the most important, industrial policy projects and we must ensure that it runs smoothly."
"This involves issues raised by the resolution, such as the questions of competition which arise in relation to international business practices and public procurement markets."
"It is true that different international regulations govern the procurement practices in the space industry."
"These practices differ depending on whether services or goods are being procured and, above all, depending on which countries have signed the relevant agreements."
"During the process of awarding contracts for the Galileo deployment phase, the Commission has strictly applied the principle of reciprocity and we hope that this has given a boost to the negotiations with third countries on the mutual opening up of markets."
"One final point, and I am very grateful that Parliament has considered this, is the question of the involvement of small and medium-sized companies in European space activities."
"This is very important to me, because there are only a few large-scale European players in the space industry."
"There are only a handful of European countries which can really have a presence in space."
"However, many others are making contributions and I am very pleased to see that specialist space technology is increasingly being developed in a number of Member States, particularly the new Member States, by small and medium-sized companies which are providing often extremely complex and highly advanced products and services."
"For this reason, it is important that we ensure that small and medium-sized companies are given an appropriate proportion of the orders on major projects."
"This proportion is set at 40% and the Commission will do everything in its power to make sure that the proportion is adhered to."
"This is not a purely economic issue, it is also a political question, because this will allow us to ensure that European space-related activities are not regarded simply as the privilege of a few large European countries, but are seen as something which all 27 countries are involved in and can benefit from."
"Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"The title of our parliamentary decision is 'How to bring space down to earth'."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the average citizen of Europe makes use of 50 satellites a day."
"The utilisation of space has quite imperceptibly come to be part of daily life."
"The question is: can Europe cooperate in that process, can it actively shape the utilisation of space?"
"A few remarks are in order."
"Space is our common and global asset."
"Therefore, international cooperation is of paramount importance to Europe."
"However, Europe can participate meaningfully only if it has established its autonomy in the political, technological and operational fields."
"Hence, it has relevance for Parliament."
"In light of the global financial and already partly economic crisis, we now see clearly that high-technology initiatives such as space utilisation add a significant edge to our competitiveness."
"Moreover, given the challenges we face and the related tasks to be tackled, we rely increasingly on space technology, for example, to understand and monitor climate change or achieve security by means of defence, the prevention of increasingly frequent catastrophes or the provision of ever broader communication and navigation services."
"Thus, we are dealing with strategic questions here."
"The European Parliament wishes to play a constructive part in this process, primarily by fostering a structured dialogue between the EU and government institutions."
"In our opinion, this will provide all Member States with the opportunity to participate and gain open and fair access."
"Galileo, our joint European project, was a pioneer in many respects."
"To name but a few: it set up the operational model of the Galileo Interinstitutional Panel to create closer cooperation, and in the case of larger projects, we were able to secure joint funding built into the Community budget."
"This is only the beginning, however."
"The Galileo programme, as Commissioner Verheugen mentioned, secured the participation of SMEs because we know by now that spin-off companies are the ones most capable of accomplishing great things in the high-tech world."
"The European People's Party and European Democrats have made countless proposals, concerning, in part, our industrial policy where we still have a lot of catching up to do before it might serve as a solid base."
"Furthermore, we have to strengthen our role in research and development."
"Besides, these competencies are essential for defence and security policy as well."
"In this way, the European space policy will come to be part of Europe's identity. Thank you for the floor."
"Satellite navigation systems and satellite-based telecommunication networks, services and applications are tools which the European Union needs to invest in."
"Research is one of the fundamental pillars on which the Lisbon Strategy is based."
"The GALILEO programme is one of the priority projects for European research in view of its potential use for managing traffic, monitoring the effects of climate change and for intervening in situations involving emergencies and natural disasters."
"Last year, the European Parliament, along with the Commission and Council, managed to identify sources of funding for the GALILEO project, which was regarded as one of the Union's strategic projects."
"I would like to stress the importance of developing a space-related industrial policy."
"I would also like to remind you that the GALILEO Regulation sets a benchmark for the involvement of SMEs in European space-related industrial policy."
"It is time for Europe to develop a common vision and strategic planning for space exploration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that we are all in agreement here on the fact that space policy has become an essential component of the future of our society."
"We could sum up three important strands to this: security and defence, protection against environmental crises and the supply of new services to human activities."
"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we must, as Europeans, recognise that space is taking on a strategic defensive dimension."
"I know that some of my fellow Members dispute this."
"Yes, the observation of the planet must be assured in the long term so as to study its slow, dynamic variations and, in particular, those caused by the actions of man that affect the global climate, natural resources and biodiversity."
"At the same time, a large number of public policy groups and economic activities need information and forecasts from observation systems based in space."
"This, in particular, is the importance of Europe's GMES in the world GEO process."
"Yes, space policies are having a growing impact on scientific research, technological innovation and, beyond that, on the stimulation of imaginations."
"In this respect, space and planetary exploration programmes have an essential role to play from now on."
"Telephony and television, GPS, but also weather forecasting or even long-distance medical care have dramatically changed our way of life."
"We can no longer imagine what would happen if satellites stopped working."
"The experience acquired in space technologies - notably through the success of the Ariane rocket - in itself justifies implementing a real European space policy."
"To respond to our ambition of independence, it will be necessary to achieve not only good governance, but also, of course, good funding."
"In conclusion, the space policy that Europe pursues will demonstrate its willingness, either to remain an influential actor on the world scene, but one that is more or less reduced to a partner role, or to be a strong Europe, a major player in world governance capable of resolving the key problems facing the future of humanity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my former capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Transport, I held a enthusiastic viewpoint on the Galileo project."
"Today, we see that this central project was bogged down due to the omnipotence and technocratic inertia of our institutions."
"Every time that the Union refused free and variable cooperation between States, they sterilised private initiative, increased costs and impeded the emergence of rival, competent and coherent consortiums."
"Yet on each occasion that states have united together freely, projects have succeeded."
"Hence, here, as elsewhere, the role of our institutions is to maintain a simple substitute role, wishing to be the manager of all, whereas we ought to be the guarantors of little."
"We should bear one thing in mind: when dealing with space matters, Europe must, first of all, keep its feet on the ground."
"Mr President, I had a childhood ambition of being one of the pioneers in space - I daresay many other children had the same - and when I grew up, in 1969, I was inspired by those images that came back to us from the Lunar Landing Project, particularly the television image of the Earth from space."
"Space is now less of a headline grabber, but it is extremely important for all the reasons that other colleagues have given and I applaud the European Union commitment to a space policy."
"I visited the NASA Goddard Center in Washington a year ago and, very recently, ESA, the European Space Agency Centre in Rome, and to me the images they can show us of the work that they undertake make space as exciting as ever."
"In fact, the more people see these images, the more perhaps we will bring space down to earth."
"But what it also showed me anew was the relevance to science, to research and to the economy of the use of space, and the importance of the satellites and their launchers."
"Commissioner, I have been made aware of concerns felt by satellite operators about the need to observe international agreements with regard to spectrum usage and satellite footprints."
"There is a concern that if any breach of international arrangements is tolerated, other regions will breach them too."
"It seems to me that effective exploitation of space depends crucially on observing common agreed laws and principles, so I hope the Commission can reassure us and them on that point."
"We have a good story to tell of achievements and prospects in space."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Pribetich, in my opinion your proposal is very comprehensive and balanced."
"I therefore want to congratulate you on shedding more light so that we can see the stars better."
"The European Union must, without question, be responsible for defining Europe's political aspirations in terms of space, by using it for the European people and economy, and by guaranteeing independent and reliable access to it."
"I am also pleased with the Council's conclusions from September which make a useful political commitment to develop the European Space Policy."
"The priorities must clearly be the timely application of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme which will assist in the assessment and implementation of European policies impacting on the environment."
"As regards financing, we must find instruments appropriate to the European Space Policy which, in addition to that specified in the Seventh Framework Programme, will enable medium- and long-term planning."
"The possible inclusion in the budget of a specific chapter will show the European Union's commitment to this policy and increase its clarity and transparency in anticipation of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty provisions."
"(PL) Mr President, I am very pleased that we are developing our space programme in cooperation with the Russians."
"However, we must remember that in the background there is another partner with which we need to establish cooperation - Ukraine."
"The best Soviet rockets were built in Ukraine."
"Its potential in this area is enormous."
"I think that we need to recognise it and use it for our common good."
"My other comment relates to the Galileo programme."
"We must remember that this programme can and should be extremely important to our military operations and our military missions as well."
"The important thing is that the use of this system for military purposes must be adequately safeguarded, so as to ensure that other programme participants - I am thinking of China above all - should not know how to and should not be able to block it."
"Before handing over to the Council, may I bring to your attention ladies and gentlemen the fact that there are three Members of this House born on 5 August - that is to say, the birthday of Neil Armstrong."
"I happen to be one of them, which is why I am aware of this."
"I will leave you to reflect on this while listening to the Council."
"That does not surprise me, Mr President, and I am very happy for you, you are well worthy of it!"
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, honourable Members, I will be very brief as much has already been said."
"Firstly, your speeches and debates have shown the mobilisation of your House around the issue of European space policy."
"We are in search of a unifying European project."
"We are in search of European projects that truly stimulate and ensure that new generations of Europeans can take part in this unique adventure."
"We are, as has been underlined, in search of projects targeted to improve the practical lives of our fellow citizens."
"We are in search of projects with a real purpose to develop competitiveness, to associate different European industrial partners and to support activity during this period of depression."
"We are in search of projects aimed at improving research, development and innovation."
"We are in search of projects - to be truly comprehensive - that make Europe more visible, make it a global actor and influential in dealing with the global challenges that await us, whether they be the fight against climate change, or matters of development, or the strategic balances with our other partners."
"I believe that your debate shows us clearly that we absolutely must not relax our efforts."
"On the contrary, we must concentrate all of our means, all of our abilities of cooperation on that most symbolic of European projects: the European space policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the broad support for European space policy demonstrated by this debate."
"I would very much like this broad support to be shown during the process of creating the financial foundations for a permanent and lasting European presence in space."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that our competitors are not sitting back and doing nothing."
"Other regions in the world are already far ahead of us when it comes to the vision of what should be done next."
"If we cannot identify new projects and develop new technologies, we will not be able to retain our leading position in the field of space-based applications, because we will simply not have the necessary foundations in science and research."
"For this reason, I would like to repeat that I was very grateful that all of this has been made clear today."
"If we can work together to raise awareness, we can tell all the citizens of Europe the story referred to by Mr Chichester, the story that European space projects can be the cause that brings us all together."
"The debate is closed."
"Need for the Convention on Cluster Munitions to come into effect before the end of 2008 (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council (B6-0481/2008) on the need for the Convention on Cluster Munitions to enter into force before the end of 2008, by Mrs Beer, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Mrs Gomes, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck and Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mr Kristovskis, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, Mr Pflüger and Mrs Zimmer, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, and Mr Zappalà on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats (O-0110/2008/rev. 1)."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 December 2008 in Oslo, we will at last reach the point of being able to sign the convention banning cluster munitions."
"In Dublin, 107 states adopted the convention and promised to sign it."
"Two weeks before the conference, we would like to call on countries throughout the world to keep their promises, to sign the convention and, above all, to ratify it quickly."
"The war in the Caucasus and the use of cluster munitions both by Georgia and by Russia, represent a challenge to us."
"We must not waste any more time."
"We have high expectations of the European Commission and the Council."
"We expect all the Member States of the European Union to sign the convention on 3 December, in particular those European states which are still in doubt, that is Greece, Latvia, Poland, Romania and the Republic of Cyprus."
"We expect that the European Union will continue to campaign for a legally binding ban on cluster munitions as part of the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW)."
"We unanimously condemn the unbelievable attempt by the USA, Russia and China at the last Geneva conference to legalise cluster munitions within the CCW."
"We would like, in future, to evaluate the synergies and links between the future Oslo convention and the Ottawa Treaty, which resulted in landmines being banned."
"Our resolution will act as a call to the Commission to make more funding - significantly more funding - available to protect people in the contaminated areas and to remove the cluster munitions."
"This applies to Lebanon, the Balkans and all other contaminated regions."
"We do not have any reliable sources of funding there and this should not be the case."
"If we are to take this cause seriously, the Commission must find ways of funding it."
"I would like to emphasise once again on behalf of my group that our objective is a legally binding ban on the use, stockpiling and production of these inhumane weapons which have, for decades, been a source of suffering for the civilian populations of affected areas."
"I would like once more to make it quite clear that the use of these weapons, including in countries where the European Union has police and military forces in operation, such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, represent just as much of a danger to our mission as to the people themselves."
"On 3 December, the leaders of the 107 countries which adopted the Convention on Cluster Munitions in May of this year will meet in Oslo to sign it."
"The choice of 3 December is not fortuitous."
"On this same day in 1997, the Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines was opened for signature in Ottawa."
"These instruments do not only share their date of signature."
"Shamefully, neither Convention has the support of countries representing a large part of humanity, such as the United States, China, India, Iraq, Pakistan, Russia and Israel."
"The Oslo Convention was negotiated in Dublin and 22 out of the 107 signatories are members of the European Union."
"We hope that Cyprus, Poland, Romania, Latvia and Greece will shortly abandon their reservations, thus allowing the European Union to present a united front in its opposition to these weapons which kill and maim indiscriminately."
"These weapons are not only immoral, they are increasingly useless in military terms."
"The European Defence Agency itself explains, in its 'Long-Term Vision Report for European Defence Capability and Capacity Needs', that:"
"'serious thought needs to be given to the future utility of unguided munitions, as well as cluster bombs, mines and other weapons of indiscriminate effect'."
"(PT) European military forces, and not just them, are increasingly operating in the midst of civilian populations and the objective is less and less to destroy an easily identifiable enemy."
"As a result, cluster munitions are not only incompatible with humanitarian law, they are also of limited use."
"International law, moral imperatives and the most basic military logic agree on the urgent need to eradicate these weapons."
"It is therefore essential to ensure the universal ratification of the Oslo Convention."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of my group, I supported this oral question in order to express our disapproval of cluster bombs and munitions, for reasons that are entirely evident, and to show our support for the attitude of those Member States who have given their agreement to the convention banning them."
"I hope, as do my colleagues, that in the coming weeks, all Member States, without exception, will sign this convention and will adhere to it because, as you well know, it is said that either under the leadership of the United States or inspired by them, some states, several of whom are Member States, plan to get around the convention by, if I may say so, playing with the definition of what constitutes cluster bombs and munitions and their reduced risk of inadvertently injuring people who touch the unexploded fragments."
"I hope that this does not occur."
"My group hopes that this does not occur and I therefore take my opportunity to ask the Council what steps it plans to take to ensure that this convention enters into force."
"Finally, turning to another matter, Minister, I read that in the near future, you may be moving on to new challenges, as we say."
"Should that be the case, my best wishes and those of my group go out to you."
"Mr President, representatives of the Commission, representatives of the Presidency, first of all, I would like to say that I was defence minister in my country for nearly six years, during the period leading up to our accession to NATO."
"Therefore, I can say that I understand very well what it means to look after one's country through defence measures, through the requisite weaponry and ordnance."
"However, on my own behalf and also on behalf of the UEN group, I have supported all the measures which the European Parliament has taken, including this issue regarding the prohibition on cluster munitions."
"In my view, everything has already been said here."
"It is clear to all that this weapon is not accurate enough and that to date, as we can see, it has mainly struck civilians and has wounded children."
"I would therefore like to say that the European Parliament and I myself believe that the EU Member States ought to come together in a united position and use their joint forces to unite on banning this kind of weapon."
"On the other hand, I would also like to advocate the use of this requirement in bilateral talks with countries such as Russia, the United States of America and China, who are the main holders of this type of weapon."
"I believe that this is very important, when we recall that quite recently, during the war between Georgia and Russia, unfortunately Russia used this type of cluster munitions against Georgian civilians."
"This confirms that the argument for retaining this munition in our arsenals, namely, the argument that it is a defence tool, does not withstand criticism."
"Unfortunately, as we see, this instrument is used in other countries as an offensive tool against civilians."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cluster munitions are, to all intents and purposes, weapons of mass destruction, inhumane devices, if it is possible for a humane device to exist in a war."
"A US army publication, Field Artillery, states: 'Unexploded bomblets are a problem for innocent civilians and our light forces, our dismounted infantry, who come after the bombardment of an urban area', and nonetheless they continue to be produced and used and land polluted with unexploded devices continues to sow death year after year, as we have also seen in Georgia."
"In Oslo, at the conference to combat the use, production and stockpiling of cluster munitions, a young Lebanese man aged 24, Ibrahim, whose body had been devastated by wounds, and who had an amputated leg, introduced himself, saying: 'Pleased to meet you, I am a survivor'."
"I would have wanted to die, and instead I just embraced him."
"I went to meet him in his village, in the south of Lebanon, and I saw in the yards of the houses, the schools, in the grass, under the trees, unexploded bombs, launched from Israeli planes."
"They launched over 1 400 000 of them, and they launched them in recent days, when the truce and ceasefire had already been declared."
"This was pure cruelty, and I met many children, men and women in Afghanistan in the emergency hospitals, with mutilated bodies; there are thousands of children in the world mutilated because they played with fragments of cluster bombs, attracted by the coloured objects."
"In Dublin, 109 countries undertook, after 10 days of debate, to sign the prohibition on the deadly weapons, to provide assistance to victims and to provide financial help to the areas involved, but the agreement also stipulates that all the arsenals must be destroyed within eight years."
"They will certainly not do this unless there is strong pressure from all the signatory countries of the United Nations and the countries which are responsible for crimes against civilian populations countries such as Israel, the United States, Russia, China, India and Pakistan, which did not go to Dublin and which have refused to ban cluster munitions."
"Robert Gates, Defence secretary, has attempted to explain US resistance: cluster munitions are an effective weapon against many different objectives."
"The dead in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in the former Yugoslavia have certainly tested this."
"Once again, Europe is showing its sensibilities, with the 22 countries that have signed and acceded to the Dublin Convention, but concrete action is needed."
"On 2 and 3 December, the treaty will be officially signed in Oslo, but it will have to be ratified."
"We must do so quickly and block any attempt to get round the treaty, and I believe that the Council will really have to lay down effective political and financial instruments to ensure that the treaty is implemented and that there are no more deaths of this kind, namely deaths caused by weapons of destruction."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is just a point of information for the Presidency of the Council, if you, as current President, can pass it on to your predecessor: Earlier it was said that here, in this Chamber, there are three people who were born on the same day as Neil Armstrong."
"In fact, a European astronaut of Italian origin was a Member of this Parliament between 1994 and 1999; and during this legislature, there is also a European astronaut in this Parliament, again an Italian."
"In any case, coming back to cluster munitions, on behalf of my group, I joined the initiative on this subject because I believe it to be a matter that goes to the heart of civilisation and humanity."
"My fellow Member was minister of defence in one of the Member States, and I also come from the military world."
"I believe this plan to ban cluster munitions globally to be a matter, as I was saying, that goes to the heart of civilisation and humanity."
"Why is this?"
"It is because civilisation and humanity are two of the many constituent principles of the European Union; they form part of the foundation of our treaties and I therefore believe that we must not merely take this matter as a starting point, but we must make it our serious business to consider what the EU's attitude ought to be as a whole with regard to munitions of this type."
"What these weapons and munitions give rise to around the world is, however, clear."
"In all forms of war, the facts are what they are, but the most serious point is that it does not all finish with the end of the war, but continues afterwards because the land is contaminated, and continues to be so."
"Unfortunately, another point is that war also takes place in countries that certainly do not have a very advanced level of civilisation, and therefore there remains that readiness, including at the local level, to use objects found on the land and which are then the cause of the majority of disfigurements that happen in childhood to young people."
"Many films have been submitted to us and continue to be sent to us from around the world showing the results of using these weapons."
"I therefore call upon the Council, on behalf of my group, and upon the European Parliament, to persist with this issue."
"I hope that all this work will translate into the ratification of this convention which I believe is one of the most important aspects, in fact, of civilisation and humanity that the European Union can act upon."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Mrs Beer, Mrs Gomes, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, whom I thank personally for her kind wishes, Mrs Morgantini, Mr Kristovskis and Mr Zappalà, you are all profoundly correct: as Mr Zappalà said, it is a question of civilisation and humanity."
"All Member States of the European Union share the humanitarian concerns raised by cluster munitions."
"The European Union supports the adoption of an international instrument prohibiting cluster munitions, which cause unacceptable harm to civilian populations."
"It was for this reason that all the Member States of the European Union attended the conference in Dublin, either as stakeholders - like the large majority of Member States - or as observers."
"It is, of course, the European Union that is the stakeholder; that is what one must understand from this rather complicated phrase."
"With regard to the decision to sign or ratify, this is a sovereign decision that falls upon each Member State, but like Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I regret that they will not all have signed by this December."
"The vast majority of Member States of the Union have announced their intention to sign the convention in the coming weeks, I would like to point this out and say that Mrs Morgantini is right; we need to take practical steps before the convention enters into force."
"In this spirit, France, the country that I know the best, decided, in May 2008, to withdraw from service 90% of its stock of cluster munitions, without delay."
"As you know, however, a number of Member States have yet to take such a decision."
"As far as the French Presidency is concerned, it announced in May, following the Dublin Conference, that it will sign the convention in early December."
"The Presidency wishes to draw the attention of all Members to the on-going negotiations on cluster munitions within the context of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) which is the only convention that the largest military powers - the United States, Russia, China and India, or countries such as Georgia - agree to participate in, which is not the case for the Oslo convention."
"I would point out that these countries have not expressed an intention to sign this convention."
"All Member States of the European Union are party to this convention and are calling for the adoption of a protocol on cluster munitions."
"It is also through commitments made in this arena, and Mr Kristovskis is entirely right to emphasise this, that it will be possible to achieve changes on the ground."
"Furthermore, the deaths caused by cluster munitions, such as we have seen in Georgia, could be avoided in the future if the negotiations taken within the framework of this universal convention are successful."
"Honourable Members, as you can see, cluster munitions are an issue that presses the European Union to act, and it must continue to press at an international level for the adoption of a universal instrument."
"It is, in any case, with this aim in mind that the French Presidency is going to great lengths to convince all its partners, and will continue to do so."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I am no pacifist - anybody in this Chamber who knows me well would say that - but there is much about warfare and the arms trade which we must regret."
"Cluster munitions to me are one of the most horrible ways of waging war which should always, of course, only occur as a very last resort."
"There is much evidence to suggest that these weapons disproportionately affect civilian populations, who must be protected above all in international law."
"Cluster bombs can fall across a huge area and remain unexploded for very long periods of time, posing a lethal threat to civilians who could be killed or maimed long after a conflict has ended."
"They are also costly to locate and remove and cannot be formally mapped in the same way that a minefield can."
"Sometimes children have picked these things up, thinking of them as toys, and losing limbs or perhaps even their lives as a result."
"As a father of very young children myself, few things could be more horrendous to think about."
"If we are serious about creating a European Union of common values and sharing those values with the world, we must take a common position to promote an eventual ban on these terrifying and terrible arms, which are very blunt in their effect on the battlefield."
"We must also use all diplomatic means at our disposal to persuade others to do the same."
"We, as the European Parliament, can rightly be proud of what we have done to try to rid the world of the scourge of anti-personnel land mines."
"We must approach this issue of cluster bombs with equal vigour and commitment, in order to build a better, more humane world and not see innocent civilians suffer in the aftermath of armed conflict."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, today we are appealing to the EU countries who are not currently planning to sign the Convention against cluster munitions to do so."
"Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia, alongside EU aspirants Serbia and Turkey, please join the other EU countries and more than a hundred states worldwide in signing this Convention."
"For whom are we making this appeal?"
"For Suraj Ghulam Habib of Herat in Afghanistan who, when six years old, lost both his legs when he found a cluster bomb he thought was a kind of food."
"He now finds it almost impossible to get to school or to play with his friends from within his wheelchair."
"For Mrs Chanhthava of Sepone District in Laos, who lost a leg and damaged her sight after she accidentally struck a cluster bomb while working to gather food for her family in the rice fields."
"She now has to send her daughter out to the same dangerous fields to collect the rice."
"For the 13-year-old Georgian boy, Beka Giorgishvili, who, this year, whilst at a friend's house, became one of the newest victims as he was helping to pump up his friend's new bicycle tyre."
"Beka lost part of his skull and shrapnel remains inside."
"It is hypocrisy for EU countries to condemn Russian aggression in Georgia, yet fail to condemn the means of that aggression, which causes excessive harm to civilians wherever cluster munitions are used."
"It is also a hollow excuse for countries to seek to justify stockpiling cluster bombs as part of adhering to the landmines ban, when cluster munitions are equally deadly and have caused even greater humanitarian damage in the world."
"My own Member State, the UK, has already started the destruction of some 30 million explosives, changed its export control regulations and directly contributed to the clearing of ordnance, including cluster munitions in Georgia."
"Europe is where these weapons were first used by German and Soviet forces in the Second World War, Europe currently stockpiles an estimated one billion bomblets, and it is Europe which should take the lead in the world in securing their obliteration."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as many people have said, civilians, many of them children, are indiscriminately killed or injured by cluster bombs every day."
"Many of those child victims are disabled by cluster munitions and have to live with that disability for the rest of their lives."
"Yet the shocking fact is that cluster munitions are stockpiled in over 15 EU Member States."
"Horrifyingly, there is evidence that at least seven EU Member States are still producing these weapons."
"In my view, these countries, as well as those that have used them - including the UK, my country - have blood on their hands."
"Banning the production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions will save many lives."
"This Convention will also ensure the provision of much needed resources, such as medical care and rehabilitation to aid victims of cluster bombs."
"I urge all EU Member States to sign and ratify this Convention and not to try to redefine what we mean by cluster munitions so as to wriggle out of their responsibilities, as certain Member States are trying to do."
"Mr President, I strongly support the proposal requesting that the Convention to ban cluster bombs be implemented from the end of this year onwards."
"All of the governments which implement the Oslo Declaration of 2007 are willing to draft a legal document before the end of 2008 that would stop the use of cluster bombs; and that would put a system in place to encourage cooperation and help for those who fled from these kinds of attacks until now and that would destroy any stocks of cluster bombs still in existence."
"I am very proud that it was in Ireland - in Dublin in my own country - that the settlement under this Treaty was reached during an international convention that took place there earlier this year."
"All those who took part were very clear about what they wanted to achieve at this convention - that cluster bombs would be banned from now on."
"And, just as my colleagues have already asked in the House today, I would ask that the other countries which have not signed it yet would sign it now."
"We must put an end to these terrible weapons once and for all."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an excellent thing that the Convention on Cluster Munitions has been introduced."
"It is very important that all the EU countries join the Convention, including Finland, Greece and Poland, otherwise, we will be giving other countries an all too easy excuse to continue using these inhumane weapons."
"I greatly regret that my own country, Finland, intends to remain outside the Convention."
"The justification for this is that cluster munitions have been acquired to take the place of another type of inhumane weapon, the anti-personnel mine."
"This, however, is like using Beelzebub to cast out the Devil."
"At the end of the 1990s, when the Finnish government of the time decided to phase out anti-personnel mines, the army did not say it was going to replace them with that other killer of civilians, cluster munitions."
"The EU and all the EU countries must now show consistency in their opposition to cluster munitions and also refuse to engage in any military operations in which they are used."
"As many as 98% of the victims of cluster bombs are said to be civilians."
"We have well over 20 years of experience with these weapons, showing that they indiscriminately kill civilians, including children."
"It is now time we put a stop to this."
"Mr President, honourable Members, solemnly and seriously, I have to tell you that I was truly proud to participate in the debate that we have just had on cluster munitions and, on behalf of the Presidency, I join all those who have called for the ratification of the convention."
"The European Union has already recognised, in 2007, the urgency with which these humanitarian concerns about cluster munitions must be addressed."
"I know that the Member States of the Union have played an active role both in the Oslo process and within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons."
"In our view, this Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons and the Oslo process are mutually reinforcing, and it is to the credit of your House, and to those who have taken the floor, to have reminded us of the values that Europeans believe in."
"We call on all Member States to act for those reasons that you have, better than I, movingly set out during the course of this debate."
"I have received two motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - I urgently call upon all EU Member States to immediately ratify and implement the Convention on Cluster Munitions."
"Cluster Munitions visit unspeakable and indiscriminate horror on civilian populations worldwide, most recently in the Georgian conflict."
"The Convention on Cluster Munitions prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of Cluster Munitions."
"The Convention was adopted by 107 states at a conference in Dublin in May this year."
"However, the Convention will not enter into force until at least 30 states have also ratified it."
"It beggars belief that eight EU Member States have no immediate plans to sign the Convention."
"Thus the EU, the most successful peace project ever, a community founded on the very principles of respect for human rights and the rule of law, fails to endorse the extension of international humanitarian law to ban one of the most insidious anti-civilian weapons in use today."
"I call on Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions without delay and help bring an end to the use of cluster bombs."
"in writing. - We should take into account that cluster munitions are one of the most damaging weapons, which do not see a difference between military and civilian targets."
"Today, in the 21st century, making war can no longer be led by the idea of ravaging or by the idea of maximum damage."
"Targeted attacks with a minimum effect on civilians can be the only way to act in a war situation."
"Therefore using cluster munitions has to be clearly rejected and forbidden."
"I call upon the European Union and its Member States first of all to urge other states in the world to sign this convention on 3 December this year."
"Furthermore I call upon the EU and its Member States to commit ourselves to pursuing the implementation of this convention efficiently and as fast as possible."
"I also call upon the EU and its Member States not only to tackle the technical parts of the Convention, but to seriously dedicate themselves to helping in the areas where cluster munitions have been used, to assist the societies concerned and to provide effective and tailored help to those civilians affected by the harm caused by cluster munitions."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0484/2008)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Commission."
"Part I"
"Subject: Information for citizens on EU measures to protect them from the international financial crisis"
"In reply to my oral question on the impact of the international credit crisis during the plenary sitting of the European Parliament held last March, the Commission stated that we should expect a fall of 0.5% in the EU's growth rate, an increase in inflation and an external trade deficit of EUR 185 000 million in the EU of 27."
"The Commission stressed that the best way of dealing with this international crisis was to continue with structural reforms and macroeconomic policies, pointing out that protectionism is not a solution."
"Currently, we are witnessing the further spread of the financial crisis, which is now also affecting the big conglomerates."
"Have the data which the Commission previously provided changed?"
"How will it inform European citizens of the implications of this crisis and what practical measures will it take to protect them?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission presented its autumn forecast on 3 November, which indicates that the economic outlook is bleak: economic growth is expected to come to a standstill in 2009, increasing by a meagre 0.2% in the European Union."
"2010 should see a gradual recovery for most EU economies, with growth projected at 1.1% for the EU as a whole."
"As a result, unemployment is expected to increase to 7.8% in the EU in 2009, with a further increase projected for 2010."
"However, next year we expect inflation to fall back quickly to 2.4% in the EU and to decelerate further in 2010."
"There is no question that the challenges we face are substantial."
"Hence, the Commission is now developing a comprehensive strategy to manage the financial crisis and limit the economic downturn."
"The basis of this strategy is set down in the communication entitled 'From financial crisis to recovery: A European framework for action', which indicates how the EU should tackle the next stages of the crisis in a united, coordinated manner."
"Action should be geared towards three objectives: first, building a new financial market architecture at EU level; second, dealing with the impact on the real economy and, third, coordinating a global response to the financial crisis."
"On 26 November, the Commission will propose a more detailed version of this EU recovery plan, under the umbrella of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"Our aim is to bring together a series of targeted short-term initiatives that will help counter adverse effects on the wider economy, while adapting the medium to long-term measures of the Lisbon Strategy to take account of the crisis."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply."
"However, what we need to say to European citizens today is that we are responding to the credit crunch and shall be injecting money into the real economy."
"European citizens also want this crisis to be an opportunity for Europe, for civil Europe."
"My question is: will money be injected into public investment and public works over coming years?"
"(DE) Madam Vice-President, when the latest information is available, rapid decision-making is needed."
"The problem is that it generally takes a very long time for the Commission, which takes the form of a collegial body, to put things into motion."
"Are there special rules for situations like the one which we are currently confronted with?"
"In other cases, it really is a long time before the Commission, as a collegial body, produces a result."
"(LT) Mr President, Mrs Wallström, as experience shows, the Member States themselves are seeking a way out of the consequences of the financial crisis and the economic recession."
"What is your opinion of the pre-crisis measures?"
"Do increased taxes, an expansion of the tax base and the VAT increase offer an effective way out of the crisis during such a difficult period?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The most important question right now is: what are the next steps for the Commission in the coming week to actually deal with the effects on the real economy?"
"We are going to present a package - which is being worked on at the moment - where we identify the different policy fields where we think we can mitigate the impact on the real economy in the short run, whilst sticking to the existing medium-term reform priorities of the Lisbon Strategy."
"That will be the framework within which we work."
"We hope that we can find actions which will help to bolster aggregate demand; on the demand side, we want to reduce inflationary pressures and help the purchasing power of households."
"We have to do more on the labour market and, as you say, front-load investments."
"We hope that this will also help the issues and the actions taken when it comes to the energy and climate change package, because we will need money for investments."
"We hope that will help to push in this difficult period."
"On the labour markets, for example, activation policies can be very helpful."
"In reply to the last question, I would say that we want Member States to coordinate action."
"We think the worst thing would be if everybody went in different directions doing whatever they thought was the right thing to do in their respective Member States."
"We want them rather to discuss, coordinate and cooperate as much as possible, because the effects will be felt on the whole economy in Europe."
"We prefer actions in a coordinated way."
"What about the long lead time or the long time to prepare?"
"You would be surprised."
"As I said yesterday in the debate on the financial crisis, the Commission, for the first time, has managed within 24 hours to get proposals on the table."
"We have to respond to this very serious crisis in such a way that we do not take too long to prepare the different proposals."
"We have all been instructed or we have all wanted to see in our respective policy areas how we can help, how we can overcome the long period to prepare, how we can do it more quickly, yet do it in a coordinated and respectful way."
"We are trying to get the proposals on the table as quickly as possible and we are stretching all our possibilities as much as possible."
"This is the starting point for the Commission at this moment."
"Subject: Disparities in driver blood-alcohol limits in EU Member States"
"In many Member States - for example, the United Kingdom, Italy, Ireland and Luxembourg - the limit on the amount of alcohol that anyone driving a vehicle may have in their blood has been set at 0.8 mg/l. In Slovakia and Hungary, which do not allow anyone who has consumed even the smallest amount of alcohol to drive, any driver with that amount of alcohol in their blood would be committing a serious offence."
"The rules governing the driving of vehicles, as laid down in the Polish Road Traffic Act of 20 June 1997 (Official Journal No 108, 2005, Item 908, as amended), set the permissible blood alcohol level at 0.2 mg/l. Driving with a blood-alcohol level of more than 0.5 mg/l is a criminal offence subject to imprisonment for up to two years."
"Given the current trend towards the standardisation of road traffic legislation within the EU, does the Commission intend to take steps to standardise permissible blood-alcohol levels for drivers in the EU Member States?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in fact, in 1988 the Commission proposed a directive on the maximum rate of blood-alcohol permitted for drivers, but in the absence of an agreement between the Member States and the Commission, the Commission had to content itself with adopting, on 17 January 2001, a recommendation that a maximum rate of 0.5 mg/ml be imposed in all the Member States. Today, in the European Union, only three Member States, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom, have maximum rates of blood alcohol greater than that value."
"The recommendation of the Commission also envisaged lowering the blood-alcohol rate to 0.2 mg/ml for certain categories of driver, including learners, who are the subject of the first question posed by the honourable Member."
"In fact, learner drivers are the main victims of danger on the roads and therefore it is vital to reduce as far as possible the risk factors in relation to them, for instance, by permitting for this category a blood-alcohol rate no greater, as I have said, than 0.2 mg/ml."
"This is linked to the measure known as 'zero rate', laid down for this category of driver in the communication adopted by the Commission in October 2006 and which lays down a strategy to support the Member States to reduce the damage caused by alcohol."
"Ladies and gentlemen, given this background, the Commission unfortunately does not consider that the political conditions are in place that would allow the adoption by the Member States of a piece of legislation designed to further harmonise the level of blood-alcohol permitted within the EU."
"Having said that, the Commission does not intend to remain inactive with regard to something which remains one of the main causes of deaths on Europe's roads."
"The Commission has taken various measures on this issue."
"First and foremost, with regard to road checks, in the recommendation of 6 April 2004, the Commission pushed to intensify random checks on blood-alcohol levels through an effective device to measure alcohol in blood through an analysis of exhaled air, to be used in those places and at the times in which excessive consumption of alcohol by drivers is regularly observed."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must also stress that driving under the influence of alcohol is one of the offences covered by the proposal for a directive facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety, adopted by the Commission in March of this year, and currently being debated by the Council and Parliament."
"At the last Transport Council, I was able to emphasise this to the ministers: faced with the loss of human lives, we cannot stalemate ourselves with legal quibbles or discuss whether it is an issue relating to the first or third pillar because unfortunately, legal debates serve for very little in tackling and resolving problems as serious as road accidents."
"I would like to take the opportunity of this parliamentary debate to point out that the four offences envisaged in the directive under discussion which, in addition to driving while drunk, are speeding, not wearing seatbelts and driving after having taken narcotic substances, are responsible for three out of four road accidents."
"This means that much can and must be done by the European Union, and I therefore call once again upon Parliament to go forward in the direction already embarked upon through the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Additionally I am just about to finish, Mr President, in order to be able to draw up in the near future concrete proposals regarding driving under the influence of psychoactive substances, in October 2006 the Commission launched a research project set to last for four years designed to improve knowledge in this field and formulate solutions."
"This is the DRUID project, of which you are well aware."
"Finally, the financial support supplied by the Commission for awareness-raising campaigns should be stressed."
"These are, in particular, those campaigns conducted by young people aimed at other young people to make them aware of the danger of consuming alcohol and drugs when driving a car."
"One example of many is the campaign called 'Bob' which was very successful throughout Europe, and we should also remember the commitment of the Commission, which called Kimi Raikkonen, outgoing world Formula One champion, to Brussels to be a witness for the European Union's campaign for road safety, as well as the day dedicated to road safety in large cities which was held in Paris on 10 October, and which is a further indication of the European Commission's huge commitment on road safety."
"I made this one of my priorities during the debate on confidence following my appointment as European Commissioner for transport."
"Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately more cannot be done, but I hope that I have been comprehensive in answering your oral question."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, may I thank you for your response and encourage you to take bolder steps."
"We need to adopt and update a directive introducing a total ban on drink driving."
"We must not surrender to the alcohol manufacturers' lobby and its influence, and we must not be afraid of them."
"We have a right to safe roads, and we should start with the young."
"We must be bold in tackling these projects."
"(DE) Mr Vice-President, I would like to take this brief opportunity to ask two questions."
"Firstly, you have said that the political background for a regulation of this kind is not entirely in place."
"What I would like to know is, where does the major resistance lie?"
"Does it come from individual states or from large lobby groups?"
"What is preventing the Commission from doing something in this case?"
"My second question concerns the fact that increasing numbers of studies have shown that smoking in cars is very dangerous."
"On the one hand, it is very unhealthy and, on the other, it is distracting and tiring."
"My question is whether the Commission is considering doing something with regard to this at a European level."
"My question concerns Ireland, where a large number of young people have been involved in tragic accidents as the sole occupants of vehicles."
"I should like to know whether any research has been done across Europe on this topic and if we could revitalise the programme about educating young people in driving."
"A lot more work needs to be done, and I would ask that we revitalise that education programme at the earliest possible date."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the questions that have been tabled, because they make it possible to clarify further the European Union's position."
"Mr Leichtfried, when you rightly spoke about the political problems that we have encountered, the political problems concern the Member States, but we have seen that unfortunately, the Commission's proposal was not accepted, despite a huge effort."
"In spite of the lack of agreement with the Member States on the proposal for a directive, we have persisted, and will continue to do so. I repeat now what I said at the hearing at which I gained the confidence of the Commission and Parliament: I will continue to make road safety one of my priorities."
"I intend to continue to support all the DRUID projects and programmes - this is my response to the honourable Member - with regard to the issue of provision of information to young people, and educating young people."
"This should be a priority."
"It is not tools that cause accidents; of course, it is important to have safe tools."
"It is important to have safe roads and this Parliament has decided to take, together with the Commission, certain decisions relating to infrastructure, but the main problem is educating those who sit behind the driver's wheel or on a motorbike saddle."
"We have a duty to start to educate young people, and therefore I am fully in agreement with your position and I will do all I can to ensure that programmes are always funded by the European Union and the Commission to educate young people at school."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is not by chance that I chose the former world champion as the Commission's witness, who is a young man."
"We should seek to communicate to young people, through young people who do not preach, as a head of the family may do, but who are able to explain to them what the actual risks are, because all young people, in fact, when they come out of a disco, feel themselves to be invulnerable."
"Unfortunately, that is not the case, and we must work with schools, we must work with families, to ensure that all young people are shown the risks that they run every time they sit at the wheel and, above all, if they drink alcohol or take drugs."
"With regard to the issue of smoking, I will ask the Commission departments to carry out an investigation to find out whether there are, in fact, additional risks for smokers or not."
"I am not able to give you an answer, because, from the scientific viewpoint, I do not know, but I will commission the departments, as I say, to check this."
"I believe that I have also answered Mr Sonik by confirming my commitment, and I think that I can make this commitment on behalf of the Commission - Vice-President Wallström is also responsible for communication - that we will do all we can to provide information to citizens and above all to young citizens, who are therefore learners, of the risks and dangers that they run every time they travel in a vehicle."
"Subject: Interinstitutional agreement on 'Communicating Europe in Partnership'"
"On 22 October 2008, representatives of the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council signed the first ever political declaration on an interinstitutional agreement on communicating EU priorities."
"This is an agreement of the utmost political significance since it seeks to provide an effective solution to the major democratic problem that European citizens are not adequately informed, but it also comes at a critical time since we are in the run-up to elections in the EU."
"What will be the priorities and the basic messages of the Community's unified communications policy for the year ahead, in particular during the run-up to elections?"
"How will cooperation between the three Community institutions be promoted in jointly selecting the priorities and objectives of this communications policy and also their cooperation with the relevant national authorities?"
"In particular, what will be the relation between Community and national communications policies relating to the EU?"
"What resources will be allocated to implement its new Community communications policy and what role will the new communications technologies play?"
"What will be the role of multilingualism in this context?"
"What Community funds will be used to fund individual actions under the newly established communications policy?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Parliament, the Commission and the Council have boosted their cooperation on EU communication and signed the political declaration on Communicating Europe in Partnership on 22 October this year."
"Thank you very much for your strong support on this issue."
"This is the first time that we have agreed on a common approach to communication."
"Communicating is more efficient and effective if done in a coordinated way on priority issues."
"Besides, it requires a political commitment of all actors, including Member States."
"All institutions have a responsibility to communicate with citizens about the European Union."
"However - and let me stress this firmly - the political declaration also respects the individual responsibility of each EU institution and Member State for its own communication strategy and priorities."
"Common communication priorities are at the centre of the political declaration and they will be agreed by the interinstitutional group on information (IGI) co-chaired by representatives of each institution."
"We have already identified and agreed to have four common priorities in 2009: the European elections, energy and climate change, the 20th anniversary of the democratic changes in Central and Eastern Europe and, of course, sustaining jobs, growth and solidarity in Europe."
"Implementation will be assured together by Parliament, the Commission and the Council, as well as by Member States."
"Therefore, we will aim to develop synergies with national, regional and local authorities, as well as with representatives of civil society."
"Our representations and Parliament's information offices in the Member States will work with national authorities on joint activities adapted to national conditions."
"If needed, we will enter into appropriate administrative arrangements between the services at EU and national levels and action will be financed appropriately."
"It goes without saying that in their actions, our institutions and Member States will respect multilingualism and cultural diversity."
"In this context, let me mention that the Commission is very active in facing the challenge of multilingualism."
"Among other measures, translators have been assigned to our representations in the Member States to serve local needs and help to communicate Europe in the language of its citizens."
"Finally, implementation of the common communication priorities will provide excellent platforms for European, national and regional politicians to debate with citizens on EU issues before the European elections."
"I hope it will have a positive influence on the turnout."
"(EL) Thank you very much Mrs Wallström for your reply."
"I should like, firstly, to state that this interinstitutional agreement aims, first and foremost, to introduce a single European communication policy which must be adopted, at a steady rate, slowly but surely, by all the Community institutions, so that citizens receive standard information."
"Secondly, I should like a number of clarifications on the question of financing for the new proposed actions."
"Will they be integrated into existing programmes?"
"Will a new line be created, so that there is a budget for information?"
"How will sectoral programmes be financed?"
"Will the communication policy be an independent or cofinanced policy?"
"(DE) Madam Vice-President, paper may be versatile, but it is becoming increasingly clear that it is no longer very informative."
"The electronic media - television and the internet - must be given priority in our information policy."
"Therefore, my question concerns whether we can identify a trend of this kind in current policy."
"Secondly, I was pleased that the local and regional television companies, in particular, are to be involved in this."
"This makes more sense than covering the deficiencies of the large public television companies."
"Again I am pleased to hear what the Commissioner has to say but I share the concerns of the last speaker."
"I am concerned about how the message is going to be conveyed out there and I agree about the electronic media."
"There is a real danger that brochures and books will remain in offices unread."
"I have seen this happen so many times."
"I suppose the question I want to ask is: how do you intend to get the message out there to those who are interested?"
"Are you going to try to target interested groups, or is it simply a blanket approach?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Thank you for these important follow-up questions."
"Let me say what I think is necessary."
"For the success of any campaign or information, we will need five elements."
"First, to use the internet and new technologies intensively."
"We can only dream of the Obama campaign."
"I think they had USD 1.2 billion for their information campaign, but the way they used the internet proved to be decisive."
"Therefore, we need to do that."
"Second, we need to use audiovisual tools: 60% of citizens use mainly TV and radio for any information about what goes on at EU level."
"Third, we need to engage with multipliers, such as civil society and local authorities' different networks."
"Therefore, we have other faces and other messengers about the added value of working together at European level."
"Fourth, we need to cooperate with 'ambassadors', i.e. people who are willing to stand for the cause of democracy and who can reach out more than we, the politicians, can do."
"Fifth, we need to reach young people and women, who tend to vote less and be less enthusiastic about the European Union which, not least, the referendums in Ireland, and previously in France and the Netherlands, showed us."
"These things are necessary."
"What about the money then?"
"What kind of budget do we have?"
"We have been able to identify some EUR 8.5 million in our budget for next year to cover centrally and decentrally managed actions that are linked to next year's elections."
"Our representations have been instructed to devote the bulk of their modest communication means to the EP elections and, in fact, out of the decentralised monies that they have, they have allocated 60% to this task."
"We also now have meetings at a technical level with your services in Parliament to compare notes on the different activities in the different Member States."
"This year, we have activities aimed at the elections that represent around EUR 6.2 million."
"We have projects targeting young people; we have special Eurobarometers etc. There is also money for communication on Structural Funds, on agriculture and on research in each policy area, but we do not have any extra money or special money allocated to this."
"I have asked all my colleagues to integrate the elections in their communication plans."
"They will be reporting to me on how this is being done."
"Next year's budget has not yet been finalised, so there is still an opportunity to add extra money - but this is what we can identify today in the budget."
"So there is not an over-allocation of money, but we will have to use the already existing channels."
"We will also help and assist the European Parliament as much as we can with all our resources and through our normal activities, i.e. producing audiovisual material, video clips on EUtube - all of the things that we do on a daily basis we will make sure are used to mobilise voters and to inspire good and lively discussion in the EP elections."
"Subject: Information for Europeans concerning participation in European elections"
"The recent international financial instability, which put a severe strain on international and European banking systems, was a cause for deep concern among ordinary European citizens, who did not see any solutions proposed at EU level or any sign of European solidarity during that critical period."
"What steps and what measures does the Commission propose in order to inform European citizens about European policies and solutions at EU or Member State level during times of crisis and exceptional political and economic developments?"
"What plans does it have to provide European citizens with information in the run-up to the election and induce them to take part in the European elections in the context of unfavourable developments affecting issues of importance to the EU concerning international economic and trade relations?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I know very well that the financial crisis and its impact on the real economies are of huge concern to many Europeans and, as such, this will also have a particular impact on the European elections."
"It is no wonder, then, that most people would like the election campaign to focus on economic issues affecting their everyday lives, such as unemployment, economic growth, inflation and purchasing power."
"More recent opinion polls also show that people now see the EU as a 'shelter' from the current crisis and want the EU to regulate at global level."
"The Commission keeps pace with developments."
"On 29 October, we adopted a framework focusing on dealing both with a crisis in the markets, preventing future crises through reforms of economic governance, and minimising the impact on jobs and growth."
"Proposals to follow this up are in preparation and are central strategic priorities for our legislative and work programme for 2009, which we presented to Parliament yesterday, and which was debated."
"It is important that the need for action has been recognised by the Commission, Parliament and Council and that we are about to propose sustaining jobs, growth and solidarity as one of the interinstitutional communication priorities for next year."
"This means that it will be one of the themes on which EU institutions and Member States will work in partnership to communicate on EU activities in this area."
"Plans will be drawn up on how best to do this."
"I have already mentioned the EP elections, which are another of the interinstitutional priorities."
"Here, preparations are more advanced, as we have all known for some time that it would be a priority."
"Our institutions are working in close cooperation on all election-related communications activities, and the Commission will contribute actively to the framework communication strategy adopted by Parliament."
"The Commission's goal is to raise people's awareness of the elections and generate debate on substantive EU policy issues."
"This will be partly achieved by the use of our central tools, including the use of audiovisual media and the internet, and complemented by many decentralised activities organised by the representations in each Member State in close cooperation with Parliament's information offices."
"Those events should make people aware of the fact that the voter has a choice between different policy visions of Europe and that these choices will make a big difference to the lives of all our citizens."
"(EL) Mr President, my thanks to the Vice-President for her reply."
"I trust that the measures proposed by the Commission will be implemented, because a great deal of time passes between proposal and implementation; there is the bureaucratic process and I do not know if there will be enough time before the elections for citizens to see the results."
"Financing and the information strategy can also bring about contradictory results, which is why particular care is needed to ensure that we do not hit a nerve among our citizens, who do not want to see money being squandered unnecessarily on the events, publications and decentralised activities you mentioned."
"Also, debate does not always convince."
"Perhaps we should therefore recognise the means at our disposal and be more honest with the citizens."
"(ES) Mrs Wallström, do you believe that the issue of whether electors feel close to or distant from candidates has an impact on the level of participation in European elections?"
"Do you agree with a State of 45 million inhabitants having only one electoral district for the European Parliament elections?"
"What can the Commission do to ensure that States with a larger population have electoral districts which are closer to the people?"
"I just want to say to the Vice-President of the Commission that we should look at the situation in Denmark, where they are now talking about applying for membership of the euro; in Iceland, where the country has been torn apart; and in Sweden, where clearly they are looking again at joining the euro."
"For example, who is telling the people of Ireland that, because they were under the euro and the European Central Bank, they have been able to weather this storm much better than these other countries?"
"Is it not time that we actually start talking up the European Union?"
"This week, we have Members of the European Parliament from Ireland in this House making negative comments about the European Union."
"Who is going to make the positive comments and claim the good things for us so that people know the benefits of being in the European Union and the euro?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I tried to do my bit by visiting Ireland last week."
"I tried to explain what I think are the added values of European cooperation."
"I think the debate about the euro and why it has been to the advantage of Ireland to belong to the euro area is going well now, but it raises the basic question of who will advocate the European Union."
"Who will speak for the European Union?"
"Where does the responsibility lie?"
"We can never count on Brussels doing all of that."
"It has to be shared and done in partnership."
"Actually I think that the political controversy and debate are good, because there are different versions, different programmes etc. I think that helps to raise interest, and it is also ultimately good for voter turnout."
"Of course we want to encourage and stimulate a lively debate and discussion on the European agenda and European issues."
"We all have to be advocates."
"That is why I am proud and happy that we, for the first time, have this kind of framework of an agreed partnership on communication."
"We have never had that before."
"So we should decide to share the responsibility to be advocates and also to listen to the concerns of people across Europe, because really it is communication, not only information, that matters."
"Listen better, explain better and go local: that is what I repeat with regard to communication."
"The campaign will be carried out differently in different Member States because it will have to be adapted to national conditions."
"This is what we are trying to do now."
"We are trying to speed it up as much as we can, but we also have to respect the Financial Regulation and all the rules."
"We have to be correct in everything we do."
"We had a meeting today, which we will follow up."
"We will try to respond as best we can to the Parliament's detailed timetable for planning for the EP elections."
"I think that we will already be able to allocate and spend money this year but, of course, more resources becoming available would help us to organise more activities next year."
"I repeat that I think we also have to look at using audiovisual media and the Internet more extensively in order to be effective and to reach out to young people."
"(ES) Please forgive me, but I did not hear the Commission Vice-President answer my questions."
"We note the reply given by the Commission, but we do not have the powers or the skills to assess the scope of the reply as regards its substance."
"Subject: Commission's communications strategy for the Irish referendum"
"What was the communications strategy of the Commission and its members during the run-up to the referendum in Ireland?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I would like to stress that, on the Lisbon Treaty, the European Commission has worked through its representations and in close coordination with Member States to provide factual and objective information to EU citizens."
"We have supported this work with communication kits including various materials such as fact sheets, presentations and key messages."
"We also provided training and briefings for Commissioners, representation staff, Europe Direct information centres and other information multipliers."
"Recognising the importance of the web, we have created a dedicated website with comprehensive information on the Lisbon Treaty which was launched in the 23 official languages."
"On that basis, the Commission representations in Member States have developed materials adapted for local needs and better suited for informing citizens."
"Further to this, the representations, including the one in Ireland, have drawn up communication plans in close cooperation with the national government and EP information offices in Member States."
"Activities that we planned include training for journalists and multipliers, publications of brochures and leaflets, organisation of discussions with civil society and local authorities, and also public events at schools and universities."
"As such, the citizens get tailor-made information in their language and which address their real concerns."
"(EL) Mr President, my thanks to the Vice-President."
"My supplementary question includes a proposal: Madam Vice-President of the Commission, you - not just you, the College of Commissioners - should visit Ireland at a politically convenient time for the Irish question and the entire College of Commissioners should start a debate with the citizens of Ireland and answer their questions in toto."
"Organise a debate with all the interested agencies with television coverage, so that the Irish people, the Irish electoral body can watch it and reply to their anxieties and questions in situ."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, for two months the political and media agendas have been dominated by the financial and economic crisis."
"The referendum in Ireland or the difficulties in the Czech Republic over the Lisbon Treaty have gone virtually unreported in the media."
"Do you not feel that the Commission's information and communication strategy should now be reinforced, given the need and urgency for the Lisbon Treaty to enter into force, and also as a political response to tackle and overcome the current crisis?"
"I will be brief."
"First of all, I would like to compliment the Commissioner in particular for her efforts on this issue."
"As a former journalist, can I suggest that while a meeting of the Commission might be interesting for the Commission, we cannot force people to watch it."
"The problem is, information without emotion will not be taken up and I am afraid Europe is pretty dull and boring - except your good self - so you need to address that."
"Can I also say as a former journalist - and this is terrible that I am saying this in public - I was brought here, and to the Commission, on many occasions, and the grey walls and the dull presentations did not stimulate my European genes."
"You need to tackle that issue."
"Finally, if the Irish government had, as you said, listened better, explained better and gone local, there would have been a 'yes'."
"Questions Nos 38 to 41 will receive written answers."
"(EL) Could the Vice-President please reply to my supplementary questions?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I think that maybe the President forgot to give me a chance to reply to your specific questions."
"Of course we are learning important lessons from what happened in the referendum, and I think you are right in pointing out that there should perhaps have been more visits on the 'yes' side."
"We followed the advice at the time and we fully respected the wish not to be seen as interfering with the debate in Ireland, but maybe now the Irish will want to send out invitations much more widely."
"I have encouraged all my colleagues to go there and engage in a discussion with the Irish."
"If they broadcast it on TV, I am not sure it will always be that convincing, but we appreciate the media attention."
"We are working now with the Irish government to conclude a memorandum of understanding, where we look at the things that have to be done, both in the short term and the longer term, in making sure we have better civic education, that we work with journalists, that we perhaps have a more emotional approach to some of these issues yet, at the same time, respect the laws and rules that exist in Ireland."
"We are learning lessons and I think we will very much follow your advice to go there and to respond to everything from agriculture to fisheries policy to trade etc. This is the way to meet the challenge."
"I hope that we will stimulate a good discussion. Thank you for giving me this time."
"Subject: Intra-African migration"
"The build-up of internal problems in a number of African countries and the prospects of emigration to Europe have triggered the migration of tens of thousands of Africans from the sub-Saharan countries to countries further to the north, such as Libya, Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal."
"Is the Commission aware of this situation? If so, is it considering any measures to improve the miserable living conditions of those inter-African migrants and relieve the pressure on North African countries arising from that abnormal demographic migration?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Now we are into a completely different policy area."
"The Commission is perfectly aware of the poverty which, combined with other factors such as instability, climate change and human rights violations, drives migrants to embark on a hard, sometimes tragic journey."
"The Commission is active on all these fronts, primarily via the political dialogue conducted with these countries and via the European Development Fund and its aim of combating poverty."
"In response to the tragic events in Ceuta and Melilla and as part of the global approach approved by the European Council in late 2005, the European Union wanted a structured dialogue with Africa on the link between migration and development under the Rabat process in respect of the West African migratory route, shortly to be followed up by the Paris Conference on 25 November, and the Tripoli Process in respect of Africa as a whole."
"The partnership on migration mobility and employment was launched at the December 2007 EU-Africa summit in Lisbon."
"The underlying idea is that the partnership should find solutions to migration by linking it to employment issues."
"The Migration Information and Management Centre, inaugurated by the Development and Humanitarian Aid Commissioner and Malian President Touré in Bamako on 6 October, exemplifies the practical application of the integrated approach that the Commission is striving to promote."
"It is, moreover, ready to reproduce this example elsewhere in West Africa."
"As regards migrants' living conditions, one of the objectives of the migration and asylum programme is to protect migrants' rights, inter alia, by strengthening the capacity of administrations and stakeholders in countries of transit or destination such as the North African countries to assist migrants, especially in certain conditions."
"By way of example, the European Community has recently granted funding under the programme for the following projects: the continuing financing of the Libya office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, which plays a key role in promoting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers; improving the protection of the living conditions of international migrants in North Africa; strengthening the capacity of civil society organisations in the area of promoting the rights of migrants in North Africa; and a programme enabling migrants in Libyan Morocco to return home voluntarily in decent conditions."
"Lastly, the Commission is using the programme to finance many projects in sub-Saharan Africa addressing the prevention of illegal immigration, the promotion of legal migration, the link between migration and development and the promotion of refugee and asylum-seeker advocacy."
"(ES) Thank you very much, Madam Vice-President, you have given me plenty of information on the issue that I raised and I thank you for this detailed information."
"I feel that the Commission's new phase is important."
"In particular, the Bamako project provides a focus for the European Union in terms of immigration."
"I know that this has only just started, so my question is probably premature, but I wanted to ask the Commission the following."
"If this Bamako (Mali) project produces good results in terms of immigration, does the Commission believe that this experience can be extended to the other countries around the southern rim of the Mediterranean?"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I just wanted to mention something in relation to the last session."
"I am sorry for raising it at this stage, but during the last session less than 15 minutes were given for three questions - 38, 39 and 40 - which were very much connected."
"I think it is unfortunate that they were not dealt with, because I think they could have been dealt with, and yet only 15 minutes were granted to the last session."
"I had understood it was 20 minutes."
"I think that you are right."
"I will make a note of it, but I have no other option for action at the moment."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I am also learning all the time in this job."
"I am learning that similar projects - like the Bamako project - are planned for other countries in Western Africa such as Senegal."
"So apparently this is already on the agenda and the Commission is fully engaged in developing similar projects in other countries."
"Subject: Opening of dialogue in Cuba"
"The Council Conclusions of 23 June 2008 on Cuba have been very well received in Cuban democratic circles, which appreciate the fact that the unconditional release of all political prisoners is a key priority for the EU and that it supports respect for human rights and genuine progress towards a pluralist democracy."
"In line with the commitments made in those Conclusions, can the Commission indicate whether its members have already had contacts with the representatives of civil society and the democratic opposition?"
"What effective measures is the Commission taking to further develop dialogue with those representatives, and how is it ensuring that measures intended to benefit civil society (such as microprojects to promote social integration and cohesion) do not end up being supervised by official bodies?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - The Commission maintains regular direct contact with civil society in all countries of the world, including Cuba."
"The Commission's role in Cuba is appreciated and supported by civil society and by opposition groups."
"The Commission delegation in Cuba regularly receives representatives of civil society and opposition groups, and the Commission's departments in Brussels pursue an open-door policy vis-à-vis any person or organisation that wants a constructive discussion on Cuba or any other country."
"The meeting that relaunched political dialogue between the European Union and Cuba, following the Council conclusions of 23 June which terminated the diplomatic measures adopted in 2003, was an EU ministerial troika meeting on Cuba in Paris on 16 October 2008. The positive spirit that reigned at that meeting allowed frank and open discussions to take place on subjects of common interest, such as the international financial crisis, human rights, cooperation with Cuba and reform of the United Nations."
"The Commission is firmly convinced - and the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid has said this on several occasions - that frank and open dialogue between the EU and Cuba provides the best framework for discussion on matters of common concern to the two sides, including questions of human rights."
"(ES) On behalf of Mr Yañez-Barnuevo, I thank you for your answer."
"However, Commissioner, I must say to Mr Michel that his actions, words and gestures are vital in the direct contacts made with the Cuban democratic opposition in terms of implementing the Council's priority conclusions, reducing the effects of Castro's terrible dictatorship and encouraging freedom."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - I will, of course, convey to my colleague all Parliament's responses and reactions."
"I think he recently visited Cuba but, of course, to date, we have not had the chance to develop this context."
"If I know him well enough, I think that this is definitely in his interests and that he will show openness and willingness to listen."
"This is, of course, part of what we have to do from now on."
"It is definitely in the Commission's interest as well."
"The Members who tabled the other questions are not present, and therefore written answers will be given for Questions Nos 51 to 58."
"Subject: Europe - a more attractive place for researchers"
"Statistics show that the European Union produces more graduates in the pure sciences than the USA or Japan."
"Nevertheless, studies reveal that Europe is unable to retain its high percentage of graduate research scientists and that there is a 'brain drain' to countries outside the EU."
"This situation gives just cause for concern, particularly at a time when Europe is aspiring to become the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world."
"What are the main reasons for this phenomenon and what are its implications for the EU?"
"Does the Commission have statistics on the employment of graduate researchers for each Member State?"
"Member of the Commission. - Researchers are at the heart of knowledge creation, transfer and exploitation."
"They are the key for Europe to turn the fifth freedom - the freedom of movement of knowledge - into reality, and with that to shape the knowledge-based economy."
"The supply of human resources for research is indeed best reflected in the number of new university graduates."
"The benchmark adopted by the Education Council in 2003, to increase by 15% the number of graduates in Member States and decrease gender imbalance by 2010, has been reached."
"In 2006, there were in the EU-27 about 200 000 more mathematics, science and technology graduates than in 2000."
"It is clear that not all university graduates go into research."
"For the European Union, an additional factor here is that, due to the lower share of private research investments in Europe compared to other continents, the market for researchers in the EU is relatively smaller than those of our competitors."
"On top of that, there is strong competition for attracting and keeping the most talented researchers."
"This is, first and foremost, a competition between research and other economic sectors."
"But there is also a competition between countries and world regions - in particular the US, but also, increasingly, China and India."
"The European Union is facing the upcoming retirement of generations of researchers in Europe, with no prospect of their complete replacement."
"The situation will get worse if young people are not attracted into the research profession."
"What is at stake is whether Europe in the long term can remain and further develop as a world-class location for research and development."
"The fact is that researchers in Europe are still faced with serious obstacles and a lack of opportunities."
"When I talk to researchers across Europe, I hear about unattractive working conditions and career prospects, an often precarious status and short-term contracts."
"Furthermore, many researchers are still trained in a way which does not equip them with the skills needed in a modern knowledge economy."
"There are strong disincentives for researchers wishing to move jobs within academia and industry and vice versa."
"Finally, the structural fragmentation of the European researchers' labour market hinders the transnational mobility of researchers within the European Union, due to, in particular, a lack of open, merit-based recruitment and to cultural factors, as well as problems encountered by highly mobile workers in such fields as social security, taxation and transferability of supplementary pension rights."
"It is therefore high time for Europe to step up its efforts to ensure the availability of the necessary researchers in the years ahead."
"That is precisely why the Commission, last May, proposed a European Partnership for Researchers: a partnership with and among Member States entailing a focused framework to make rapid progress across Europe in key areas determining better careers and more mobility."
"The Council has responded favourably to this initiative and we are about to embark on its implementation, centred on national action plans and mutual learning."
"Evidence-based monitoring of progress, data-collection on mobility and career patterns are also foreseen."
"So, while we currently have very few data, the aim is to provide ourselves with the better statistics that the honourable Member is looking for."
"We have many of the other data but not exactly these specific data."
"The Commission Communication on the European Partnership for Researchers is currently under consideration in this Parliament."
"The Commission looks forward to Parliament's opinion, which will hopefully reinforce this common endeavour for the future of research in Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, my thanks to the Commissioner for his reply."
"I have a supplementary question about the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, which has a package of EUR 54 million."
"Do you have any details, Commissioner, 18 months in to this Seventh Framework Programme, as to how it is developing, which countries have a satisfactory take-up rate, what the main problems are and if the Commission intends to produce a progress report on this financing framework?"
"(DE) Mr President, the attraction for researchers naturally also depends on the net income that they receive."
"Are we working together with Commissioner Kovács to develop a proposal which will allow researchers to pay no tax on their earnings and which will ensure that donations to research organisations are also tax-free or can be regarded as operating expenses?"
"A system of this kind is already in place in the United States."
"Would it not be possible to carry out a comparative study so that we can also provide incentives in this area?"
"I would like to ask the Commissioner, when he is revisiting these questions and listening to Parliament, if he will again revisit the question of ethical research and ethical researchers."
"It is very clear that the destruction of embryos is no longer required and there are many other avenues for exploration."
"Will he now start putting resources into those other avenues so that we can return to a fully ethical research base within the European Union?"
"Member of the Commission. - I wish to begin by saying that of course we are following all the data and everything that concerns the framework programme."
"This is available and we can provide you with the data."
"We also have regular monitoring reports, which are envisaged until the end of the year and, in addition, we will have a progress report - I think at the end of May 2009."
"But the progress report is much more: it is about providing the input of ideas on how we should proceed in the future."
"Part of the logical implementation of the framework programme is to follow what you do and where you are investing or spending the funds."
"Concerning tax-free income: I was always in favour of using those instruments which would stimulate science and research, including tax-free incomes."
"One of the problems which we have to deal with in this crisis and difficult situation is how to stimulate research and development so we are not in the same situation as companies."
"Because of the pressures, they would certainly consider reducing investment in research and development."
"This avenue is one of the possibilities, but we also have to be aware that we have a flexible growth and stability pact, which has to be followed, and we have to consider that the situation is certainly not the same in all Member States."
"Member States have different kinds of manoeuvres which they have established during the good times, when economies were better."
"Finally, you asked me about the ethical approach, which was also mentioned in another question."
"I think we have truly invested a lot in order to reach an agreement on which to base our ethical approach in science and research and also when we are using the framework programmes."
"Agreement is difficult."
"There are different views across the European Union Member States, and we can be quite proud that we have established something like clear ethical procedures which are, in reality and in practice, proving to be based on true ethics."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to apologise."
"I am normally very punctual, but there are always two sides to punctuality and this question time has been delayed."
"Therefore, I was in the Group meeting and, as soon as I saw on the screen that Commissioner Potočnik was starting, I came running over and arrived at the very second when he began."
"I would ask you to be so generous as to call my question 42, because I arrived at the plenary session at the very second that Commissioner Potočnik was called."
"You may not have seen me, but I came running in."
"Mr Posselt, we had already seen that you had arrived, although slightly late."
"Clearly, you are not responsible for this lateness, which is fully justified, and the Bureau had, in the meantime, intended to follow the order with the next question."
"We will, however, do all that we can to cover your question during this round."
"Subject: Funding for green technology"
"In today's climate of economic downturn and greater energy insecurity, citizens are looking to the EU for leadership."
"It is now time that the EU and its Member States raise the tempo and support increased funding for innovation and technology."
"We need to get the message across that the EU can be a world leader in green technology if we act now, not later."
"The challenge of climate change is an opportunity for investors, research and development, business and jobs."
"Can the European Commission lay out the current and future plans for investment funding for green technology under the 7th Research and Technology Framework Programme?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission fully supports the analysis made by the honourable Member in his oral question."
"We are the leader in green technology and we need to maintain and reinforce this position."
"This will also back the position of the EU in its leading role in the international fora for combating climate change."
"With the seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the European Union is well equipped - and Parliament played its full role in its outcome - to mobilise EU R&D funds in support of the development of new green technologies."
"The Commission is putting a lot of effort into making the most of FP7."
"Two of the joint technology initiatives adopted so far are fully dedicated to green technologies: 'Clean Sky', with a European contribution of EUR 800 million; and 'hydrogen and fuel cells', with a contribution of EUR 450 million from the European Community."
"With the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan, we are strongly endorsed by Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission has initiated a process that will enhance the effectiveness of Research & Development spending in energy research."
"The SET Plan is committed to green technologies."
"It calls for the implementation of six new priority European industrial initiatives (industry-led programmes: wind, solar, CCS, grids, bioenergy and sustainable fission) and the establishment of the European Energy Research Alliance (research-led programmes)."
"The FP7 Energy Community Programme is the main instrument available in the short term to support the implementation of these actions."
"But more than EU effort alone is certainly needed."
"Therefore, the Community Programme should be used to catalyse actions of Member States and, of course, of the private sector."
"This requires a shift in the approach: rather than just cofinancing projects, steering and enabling the deployment of a joint effort through joint programming is truly needed."
"Analysing the whole set of work programmes from the first three years of implementation of FP7, the Commission estimates that 37% of the topics supported by R&D funding are for green technology."
"Forty per cent of the budget committed after the 2007 calls, under the 'Cooperation' Specific Programmes, also support green technology R&D."
"In order to be able to monitor the contribution of FP7 to sustainable development, in general, and to green technology, in particular, the Commission is setting in place a monitoring system that should be operational in the first semester of next year."
"In its Communication 'From financial crisis to recovery: A European framework for action', adopted on 29 October this year, the Commission also emphasises the role of R&D investment and education as well as enhancing European competitiveness by continuing to green our economy."
"In more general terms, it should be noted that, in addition to FP7 funds and activities, there is a wide range of policy initiatives and supporting programmes related to environmental technologies in the EU like the Environmental Technologies Action Plan, the Competitiveness and Innovation Plan and more recently, the Lead Market Initiative and Action Plan on sustainable production and consumption."
"The Commission hopes that, with this element of response, the honourable Member will be convinced that we are fully engaged in harnessing FP7 funds to really greening our research and our economies."
"(GA) Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for that comprehensive answer."
"As regards marine research, sea research, and marine technology and science, is there help available under the seventh Framework Programme of the European Union to increase marine research and marine technology under that programme?"
"Member of the Commission. - The answer is certainly 'yes'."
"We discussed only yesterday in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy this specific activity which is devoted to marine and maritime matters."
"We want to make more progress in this area, because the situation is extremely complex."
"This whole area of oceans is extremely complex, but our life, the way we live, also influences the ecosystems there."
"It deserves special attention, and this attention should take the form of a new way of organising the system of research in this area: bringing marine and maritime researchers together, and also combining the efforts from the Member States in a different way than is the case today."
"This is a new way of thinking, which could be named 'pilot thinking' in the context of joint programming, which is something which I mentioned before."
"Certainly this will have our attention in the future also."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must try to deal with the effects of the reversal of the Question Times that we have had, by attempting to respect all and give everyone the chance to put their questions."
"In order to do this, we will try to deal with all the remaining questions, but once the Commissioner has given an answer, I will be able to give the floor only to the Member who tabled the question."
"We will not accept any other requests to speak, because that would make it difficult to achieve the final result."
"Mr President, I know I have just joined you, but I have been watching the monitor at a very important group meeting and I just wonder why we are not going seriatim."
"I really cannot stay."
"I came precisely when my question was scheduled and now you are reverting out of order."
"I would urge you please to stick to the order, Mr President."
"Mrs Doyle, I am not changing the order."
"Unfortunately, an incident occurred for which Mr Posselt bore no responsibility."
"Since there was a round of questions for which the time was changed for the Commissioners, Mr Posselt was 30 seconds late."
"I am therefore going back to the question by Mr Posselt and immediately afterwards we will have the question by Mrs Doyle."
"Subject: Cloning"
"The Commission is currently conducting a general discussion on cloning."
"What is the purpose of this debate, and what are the essential principles on which it is based?"
"Member of the Commission. - This is certainly a difficult and complex area."
"The debate on cloning at the Commission refers to the use of a technology called somatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT) with particular reference to farm animal breeding and how to deal with food produced from these cloned animals and their offspring."
"In the case of the use of this cloning technique in livestock reproduction and breeding in the agrofood sector, the questions are, in particular, related to animal health and welfare."
"In the case of the safety of food derived from cloned animals and their offspring, the questions are, in particular, related to any possible risk to human health and to the consumer's right to be informed."
"The debate does not cover the use of SCNT in research."
"The Commission has been following the development of SCNT since 1996, when the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, was born."
"In 1997, the Commission asked the Group of Advisers on the Ethical Implications of Biotechnology to issue an opinion on the ethics of cloning."
"In 2004, the Commission financed the project 'Cloning in public' under the sixth Framework Programme."
"This allowed an EU-wide debate to be launched as a first opportunity to have preliminary discussions with academics and civil society on ethical, legal and other societal aspects of farm animal cloning."
"The study concluded that the public is not well informed about the use and implications of cloning."
"The JRC published a study in 2007 in Nature Biotechnology on the prospects for future commercial use of cloning technology."
"The study mapped the state of the art of the commercial applications of animal cloning worldwide and produced a pipeline of products and their estimated time of arrival on the market."
"The conclusion was that cloned animals were not expected to arrive on the EU market before 2010 and that reproductive materials - semen - from cloned animals may be the first products to be traded."
"Over recent years, the Commission has received information that the technology of somatic cell nuclear transfer for the reproduction of farm animals is about to reach its commercial stage, in particular, in third countries, notably the USA."
"Based on the final risk assessment, a report written by the US Food and Drug Administration scientists and issued in January 2008 concluded that the consumption of food from cloned animals and their offspring is safe as long as the food comes from healthy animals, which is a general principle in food safety."
"Only healthy animals enter the food chain."
"In order to prepare for an informed political debate, in 2007, the Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to assess the actual and potential risks associated with the use of this technology in food production and also asked the European Group of Ethics (EGE) to issue an opinion on the ethical aspects of animal cloning for food supply."
"The Group released their opinion in January 2008 and the Authority in July 2008."
"According to EFSA, 'based on current knowledge ... there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety between food products [derived] from healthy [animal] clones and their progeny, compared with those from healthy conventionally-bred animals'."
"Concerning the general health conditions of clones, the EFSA opinion states that there is no indication of adverse effects for the sexually reproduced progeny of cattle or pig clones."
"However, clones and their progeny have not yet been studied throughout the whole of their natural life span."
"At present, the EGE does not see convincing arguments to justify the production of food from clones and their offspring."
"The Commission also asked for a Eurobarometer survey to be carried out on the attitude of Europeans towards animal cloning."
"The results were made available in October 2008."
"The study showed that 58% of the respondents were against cloning for food production purposes."
"The Commission is now carefully considering these various elements to prepare an informal political debate on the use of somatic cell nucleus transfer for the reproduction of farm animals and food production."
"Should it be considered necessary to further develop the regulatory framework, it is important to recall that the new provisions would, of course, have to comply with the EC Treaty and with World Trade Organisation rules."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank the President for his generosity and the Commissioner for his positive response."
"I have only one question."
"Can the Commission definitely state that cloning humans, in whatever form, is not and will not be part of this strategy?"
"Member of the Commission. - Under the rules which we currently apply, this is ruled out."
"The rules which we are using certainly do not allow research where the purpose would be the cloning of people."
"Subject: European Research Council"
"On 27/28 February 2007, the European Research Council (ERC) was officially launched at an inaugural conference in Berlin hosted by the German EU Presidency."
"One of its aims is to 'promote wholly investigator-driven or 'bottom up' frontier research'."
"Could the Commission clarify what is meant by investigator-driven or 'bottom-up' frontier research?"
"And what progress has been made to date in this area?"
"Member of the Commission. - Here, I will be brief."
"The 'investigator-driven' approach followed by the European Research Council means that it supports projects at the frontiers of knowledge carried out by researchers on subjects of their choice, in any scientific field."
"So they have the freedom to choose."
"The European Research Council, by supporting 'frontier research', puts particular emphasis on interdisciplinary projects and on pioneering research."
"So far - and now I am talking about the progress - two calls for proposals have been implemented by the European Research Council, and Europe's research community has responded with huge enthusiasm."
"A massive 9 167 proposals were submitted by young researchers in response to the Starting Independent Investigators Grants call last year and more than 2 000 proposals were received for the Advanced Investigators Grants call this year."
"This high level of participation demonstrates the appeal of the European Research Council and confirms that funding for frontier research on a bottom-up basis corresponds to an urgent need in Europe."
"The Commission is convinced that such investment in frontier research in the long term will substantially contribute to improving our knowledge-based society and also our innovation capacity in research."
"In the light of the French presidency's objective of establishing a governance process for the European Research Area (ERA) by the end of 2009, could the Commission specify what measures it plans undertaking, in cooperation with Member States and Parliament, to put in place science policy evaluation methodologies to ensure evidence-based policy options for science and research and development in the EU?"
"With the announcement of the European Research Area's '2020 Vision' agreed by the French Presidency, the Council and the Commission, what progress is being made in the whole area of governance here in the ERA?"
"Member of the Commission. - To be honest, this is quite a far-reaching question."
"We believe that it is important that we agree with the Member States on '2020 Vision', because if we do then this would certainly reduce the length of further debates about what we want to do in Europe."
"We should not repeat again and again where we are going: that is the whole idea."
"Of course, the debate is not starting now: the idea was launched with a Green Paper in 2000."
"I think it is great, especially for the new changed reality in which we live."
"The structure and governance of ERA are extremely important, and that is why we have to be patient."
"It is clear that we will not be successful if the Member States are not in the driving seat."
"When we talk about the European Research Area and stimulating that, we do not talk predominantly about increasing funds at the European level, but rather about how we can all cooperate better - something that is inherently in the basics of the institutional framework of some of our major competitors, such as the USA, with which we want to compare ourselves. So we want to create a voluntary commitment of the Member States through which we cooperate more and better than at present."
"Concerning science policy methodologies, this is all part of the discussion which we are focusing on."
"I think that this question will certainly have to be addressed, but I cannot elaborate on that."
"I know that ERA's approach is, in essence, one of the developments that Europe most needs at this time."
"Subject: Ethical review of funding for research under FP7"
"In the rules for submission of proposals, and the related evaluation, selection and award procedures under the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP7-1982/2006/EC), it was made clear that funding would not be given to research activities that involved the destruction of embryos."
"Is the Commission satisfied that the ethical review of proposed projects has been successful in the implementation of this policy?"
"Member of the Commission. - The ethical review of research funded under the Seventh Framework Programme is a system that safeguards the protection of fundamental rights and respect for ethical principles."
"In the case of research involving the use of human embryonic stem cells, the procedure consists of five steps, including the scientific evaluation, the ethical screening and review, the national/local ethics committees' approval for the proposed research and the submission of the proposals to a Regulatory Committee, so this relates to which project we decide on a single project basis."
"In July 2007, the European Group on Ethics also delivered an opinion to the Commission on ethics reviews of Seventh Framework Programme research projects using human embryonic stem cells."
"In following the above steps, the Commission considers that the established ethical review mechanism has been successful in implementing the relevant EC provisions."
"In particular, as all research activities that involve the destruction of human embryos are excluded from the scope of the Community funding, no research proposals in this area have been funded under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The ethical review is meant to verify that no EU funding is granted to research activities involving the destruction of human embryos."
"In this sense, it is an integral part of the whole implementation of the Framework Programme."
"Would the Commissioner tell the House if the framework can be used to carry out research on human embryos which have already been destroyed before the research starts, or is this semantics and are we just playing with words?"
"I return to the question I asked earlier and ask for more detail."
"Will the Commissioner take steps to ensure that everything possible is done to keep abreast of that form of research which does not raise the same ethical questions and which may well give the same or better results?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in any case, my concern is the opposite from that of Mr Mitchell."
"Research is certainly permitted on cell lines that have already been extracted."
"The problem, in my view, is that the obstacles are so great anyhow that this type of research finds itself being penalised for reasons which, on the face of it, are ethical, but which actually are no such thing."
"Mr President, you said earlier you would not be allowing questions to the Commissioner from people other than from the questioner."
"People can then come in and go on the record."
"Why do they not put their own questions down about these issues?"
"You have to follow the ruling consistently, Mr President."
"You said you would not allow anybody other than the person who put down the question to ask questions and then you allow a gentleman here to get in on the back of my question."
"If I knew that this sort of question was put down, I would have gone on much longer about the point that I want to make."
"Unethical research is totally unnecessary..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Mr Mitchell, when I give the floor to an MEP for a 30-second speech, I do not know whether he will ask a question or make a comment on the questions which have already been put."
"In any case, you had the opportunity, through Mr Cappato's speech, to make a further speech in reply."
"I believe that we can all be satisfied and, thanking Mr Potočnik for his patience, let us give him the floor for his final answer."
"Member of the Commission. - You have seen how difficult this debate is when we talk about ethical questions."
"That is exactly what Europe is and how it looks."
"To be precise, human embryonic stem cells research is allowed under conditions which were agreed and voted in the European Parliament and also in the Council."
"We have had a very thorough and in-depth debate and the procedure which is used is - I can say - based on a really ethical approach."
"I have explained in the introduction which steps we have taken and how the decision is made."
"Firstly, we need to have a scientific evaluation."
"Then we have an ethical evaluation at European Union level, then an ethical evaluation at individual Member State level."
"If any Member State is against something being funded in their country, we do not fund it."
"Then this project goes to the committee where the decision is taken by the Member States on the individual project basis."
"When we do the scientific evaluation, the first question is: is it possible to attain this with any other kind of approach?"
"And only if the answer is 'no' will we continue in the other direction."
"Normally, there is an overwhelming majority of scientists who believe that the combination should be used."
"But if you look at the structure in our programmes, you would definitely find that the overwhelming majority of the programmes we finance are programmes which are connected with adult stem cell research."
"That is quite clear."
"So we try to follow the rules which were voted and agreed here and which we believe that, in practice are working."
"Mr President, I was here at 18.15 this evening for these questions."
"My question was No 3 in a session."
"Fifteen minutes were given to it."
"Thirty-five minutes were given to this session."
"I think it is an unfair system when someone who is here on time does not get their question dealt with and I am extremely disappointed."
"I want my annoyance noted."
"It is extremely frustrating to come in here, to be here on time, and then find that questions are skipped so as to accommodate other people."
"I find it very annoying."
"Mr Burke, I understand your frustration, but the period of time laid down for every period of questions this evening has been complied with."
"Unfortunately, when it happens, as a result, that some questions are included in a question time period and are not dealt with, this depends, unfortunately, not on the President, but on a matter of chance which I can do nothing to remedy."
"The only opportunity that I had was obviously, as you can very well verify, to lengthen the time for the last period of questions by a few minutes, thanks to the Commission's availability and kindness."
"No time was deducted, however, from the other question periods."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Composition of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"Demographic tendencies - Economic and social impacts (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on demographic tendencies - economic and social impacts."
"Madam President, as we are unfortunately required to spend part of this evening together, I shall try, on behalf of the Council and also of Commissioner Potočnik, to summarise the Council's aims concerning demographic trends and their economic and social impact."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ageing population, in other words the increase in the proportion of older people, is primarily the result of economic, social and medical progress which offers Europeans the opportunity to live long lives in a level of comfort and safety which is unprecedented in history."
"However, this is also one of the greatest challenges facing the Union in the coming years."
"This ageing is the result of four factors."
"The first is that the number of children per woman is low, with an Union average of 1.5 children, which is far below replacement rate, which needs to be slightly higher than 2 - 2.1 - in order to stabilise population size."
"The second factor is the decline in fertility over recent decades, which followed the 'baby boom' of the post-war years and which means that today these 'baby boomers' are swelling the 45 to 65 age group."
"Having increased by eight years since 1960, life expectancy at birth - and this is the third factor - may well continue to increase, with an additional five years added between now and 2050, or perhaps even more."
"The fourth and final factor is that Europe, as you know, is experiencing growing migration from other countries."
"In 2004, there were 1.8 million immigrants, which is more than the United States experienced relative to total population, but this level of immigration only partly compensates for the effects of low fertility and increased life expectancy."
"We therefore find ourselves in a situation in which the level of dependence, in other words, the number of people aged over 65 compared to the number of people between 15 and 64 years of age is set to double, and will rise to over 50% between now and 2050, which means that the Union, which previously had four people of working age for every person over 65, will see this figure fall to just two."
"The demographic change that I have just described, taking into account these factors, is accompanied by profound social change affecting family structures, all of which results in an increasing number of older people living alone and very old people being dependent on others."
"As you know, most of these issues fall within the scope of Member States."
"This is the case for family policy, social security systems and, in large part, fiscal policy, and the Council, given these facts, believes that the Lisbon strategy and the open coordination method form the framework within which Member States should work in this area, and most Member States agree that no new structures should be put in place."
"For the Council, the truly important guiding principle is that, in addition to better balance between work and private life, there should be more efforts to balance the roles played by men and women within households, and to offer more good quality infrastructure to care for children and other dependent people."
"In an ageing society, the contribution of young people will become all the more important."
"We will have to intensify our efforts to combat youth unemployment and reduce early school-leaving."
"Investing in children must be our top priority if we want to improve young people's prospects."
"We must also recognise that Europe is affected more by retirement than by ageing, although these trends are worrying and, without healthy public finances, it will be impossible to tackle all the consequences of demographic ageing."
"This means that we must pay close attention to the viability of retirement schemes, and pursue the reforms underway to modernise these schemes and make them sustainable, which is in line with the current strategy within the Union."
"It will also be useful to encourage older workers to carry on working and, in particular, to provide meaningful incentives."
"The Council is fully aware of all of these challenges and has adopted the recommendations of the social protection committee concerning views on demographic change in Europe and the challenges this poses."
"In addition, the Council adopted, on 30 May, the conclusions concerning policies that are in line with families' needs, and established a series of initiatives to support family policies."
"In this context, an informal meeting was held on 18 September, organised by the French Presidency, involving ministers responsible for the family."
"At this meeting, the discussions centred on child care, as a way of ensuring balance between work and family life, and the protection of children on the Internet."
"To conclude: the Council invites the Commission to view the first forum on the future demographics of Europe, which took place in Brussels on 30 and 31 October, as a starting point for a structured and lasting dialogue, within and between Member States, and to act so that the Commission may provide support to the relevant bodies to find the best strategies for responding to this demographic change."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I might take a bit longer but I promise to compensate for that in the second response."
"Parliament's request for a statement on demographic trends from the Council and the Commission comes at the right time."
"This Friday, the Commission services will present their second demography report - in time for the European Demography Forum on 24 and 25 November."
"The European Union is going through a major demographic transformation."
"All the Member States have seen life expectancy rise and fertility rates decline among their populations as a result of scientific, economic and social progress."
"Today, Europeans live longer, healthier lives than their forbears did, and we can expect life expectancy to increase in the future."
"This ageing of Europe's population is no longer an abstract scenario for a distant future."
"The baby boom began 60 years ago and the first baby boomers are now reaching retirement age."
"So the European Union's demographic development has reached a turning point."
"From now on, the number of those aged 60 and over will rise by two million people every year for the next 25 years."
"Meanwhile, the rate of growth of the working age population is falling fast and will stop altogether in about six years."
"Today there are four persons of working age - between 15 and 64 - for every person aged 65 or over in the 27 Member States."
"In 2060, the ratio will be two to one."
"Some see ageing as a threat and paint a bleak picture of conflict between the generations."
"But demographic change need not be a threat if we look at the opportunities it holds."
"Living a longer, healthier life can mean staying active longer."
"Most of the baby boomers are better educated and better trained than previous cohorts."
"Today they are still fit and healthy."
"I am convinced that demographic change offers the chance of stronger solidarity between the generations."
"But I do not expect that to come about by itself."
"Society will have to make better use of the abilities of all generations and give everyone the chance to develop his or her full potential."
"That means modernising our social policies - in line with the renewed social agenda the Commission adopted in July."
"The renewed social agenda identified Europe's ageing society as a priority area for action and recommended a number of policy responses."
"Our goal is to help the Member States make the most of the possibilities and manage the impact of an ageing society effectively."
"The approaches and recommendations set out in the Commission's 2006 communication 'The demographic future of Europe: From challenge to opportunity' continue to be valid."
"That communication expressed confidence in Europe's ability to adapt to demographic change."
"But it also stressed the need to act in five key areas: promoting demographic renewal in Europe, by creating the conditions for our fellow citizens to fulfil their desire to have children, in particular, by helping to reconcile work and family and private life; promoting employment in Europe, by ensuring that more and better jobs are created and people can work longer, in order to improve the balance between active and inactive people; promoting a more productive and more dynamic Europe, by optimising skills at all ages; taking in and integrating migrants into Europe, by attracting skilled and unskilled workers from abroad and facilitating their integration in order to alleviate labour shortages; ensuring the sustainability of public finances, by consolidating budgets and reforming social protection systems in order to guarantee adequate social protection and public services in the future."
"The Lisbon Strategy already covers the most important of those policy responses, but it focuses less on the long term than the demography debate."
"That is why the Commission has proposed additional tools in the form of biennial reports on the demographic situation in Europe and two-yearly demography forums."
"In the 2008 report, the focus will be on the potential of the baby boom cohorts."
"A growing number of people in their 60s and 70s will probably be willing to continue playing an active part in social and economic life."
"The employment rates of older people have risen in recent years, reversing the past trend towards ever earlier retirement."
"But more needs to be done: when they reach 60, only 40% of men and 30% of women are still in employment."
"Yet most people in that age group are still fit and capable of contributing to the economy and society."
"The ageing baby boomers can also make a major contribution to society as informal care providers and volunteers."
"Their contribution deserves to be recognised and supported by public policies."
"It is crucial to ensure that the growing number of older people can lead an independent life for as long as possible."
"A key objective of demography forums is to promote mutual learning based on good practice among the Member States."
"The next European Demography Forum - to take place in Brussels on 24 and 25 November - will focus on family policies and active ageing."
"It will also provide an opportunity to take stock of how prepared the Member States are for demographic change and to identify the most important opportunities for further action."
"Early next year, the Commission will present an update of the implications of demographic change for future public spending, in particular, in the area of pensions, health and long-term care, based on Eurostat's new population projections."
"To wind up, I want to emphasise that it is the responsibility of the individual Member States to implement the right policies in the face of demographic change."
"But demographic change is a challenge we all face together."
"The Member States can learn a lot from each other's successes and failures in responding to this demographic change."
"That is why the Commission encourages a Europe-wide debate on demographic change and is offering a platform for the exchange of experiences and mutual learning."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, the two opening speeches have rightly highlighted longevity as the most significant change in demography."
"That, of course, means people are living longer, mainly healthier lives, but in later years they become frail in body or mind."
"That has meant an enormous growth in neurodegenerative diseases and the cost of that is vast."
"Drugs for Parkinson's disease in many countries cost more than drugs for cancer."
"UK research predicts that by 2051, there will be an increase of 154% in the numbers of people with dementia."
"Long-term care: that comes later now."
"It used to come in the 70s."
"Now it comes in your 80s and is increasingly coming in your 90s, but it is coming at an ever greater cost to individuals and families with implications for their savings."
"The challenge is to ensure longevity as a reward and not a punishment."
"We need to rethink our assumptions on ageing, moving from just 'How do we care?' to 'How do we promote healthy later years?'."
"That means healthier lifestyles earlier in life of course; keeping off tobacco and drugs, sensible drinking, healthy eating, exercise, but also management of stress."
"Flexible working lives: time for leisure and families."
"It means preparing for life after work with flexible retirement ages and the gradual movement into retirement that I have seen in the Netherlands."
"It means greater social support in new and innovative ways, more domiciliary services so that people can stay in their own homes for longer."
"Services and devices to match changing needs."
"When my mother reached 80, she needed a fax machine for communication."
"At 90, she needed a stair lift."
"At 100, she needed stimulation as her hearing and sight and mobility diminished."
"But the mind inside was good and needed to be protected and stimulated if she was to have a real and full life."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Madam President, the trend for there to be fewer and fewer workers and more and more elderly people could be described as dramatic, yet, at the same time, the fact that we are actually staying healthier further into old age is a positive development."
"It poses a number of challenges for us, however."
"I shall describe a few of them."
"Fewer children are born nowadays than in the past."
"That said, this situation varies greatly between the Member States."
"We can see that the outcome is better in those Member States where a system has been set up to allow parents to combine a working life with parenthood, both the women and the men in a family."
"We must learn from each other in this regard."
"Despite the fact that our population is ageing, the long-term trend is for working lives to shorten."
"This is due both to the fact that people are starting their careers later and also - with the exception of the last few years, when the development has been more positive - to the fact that career spans have been getting shorter."
"We need to do something about both sides of this problem in order to lengthen working lives and, above all, before we retire, to come up with flexible solutions."
"We have been discussing the 'Blue Card' today, but we must ensure that everyone who has come here from other parts of the world where there is currently high unemployment is integrated and enters the working world, including those with disabilities and other issues."
"We must do all this within the framework of the Lisbon process, so that we can meet these challenges over the long term."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, there are many issues that arise in the context of this evening's discussion, but I would just like to look at one of them: care and carers."
"If we are lucky enough to live long enough, we will most likely need care, and, while there are differences between Member States, the likelihood is that this will largely consist of informal care."
"Carers form the foundation of formal care and social care, and are an indispensable part of long-term care provision."
"If carers are expected to keep providing care - which they are - then their needs must be an inherent part of health and social care policy development."
"In this context, I am pleased to see that the DG SANCO website has a short section devoted to carers, and I have no doubt that this came about as a result of the submission the carers' interest group in Parliament made to DG SANCO on its annual work programme."
"However, carers need more than just a mention."
"We believe it is time to design a new social contract for care that goes way beyond the traditional view of a contract between the state and the individual, and which calls for new commitments involving employers, local agencies and communities."
"Indeed, the recent ECJ judgment on discrimination by association points the way."
"Caring cannot be the sole responsibility of the informal carer or, indeed, of the Member State."
"The informal care system will collapse without proper support, while with an exclusively state-based approach, the costs will simply be too high."
"That is why we need this wider social contract."
"Finally, there are approximately 100 million carers across the EU."
"They are unpaid, undervalued and, in many cases, inadequately supported."
"I welcome the mention on DG SANCO's website, but this is a first step only."
"By its very extent, this is a European issue and action will have to be coordinated between Member States."
"Policy on carers should be part of the work of DG SANCO, and also of DG Employment and Social Affairs."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"Europe's residents are getting old!"
"Alongside this trend, the organic increase in the number of inhabitants may become negative."
"In many Member States, this is already a reality."
"The number of people working in proportion to the number of pensioners is falling in all Member States."
"A low birth rate in conjunction with longer life expectancy and immigration is increasing pressure on pensions, health protection and social services."
"There are, however, also some Member States which have succeeded in changing Europe's negative demographic trend."
"In these countries, a balance has been achieved between life and work, which enables parents to bring up their children, without sacrificing their careers, and to obtain the economic and social benefits linked to them."
"I have no doubt that Member States will have to find the main economic, social and cultural solutions to combat the ageing of their populations."
"There are also tasks, however, which ought to be carried out at the European Union level."
"The EU labour market still conceals enormous reserves."
"We need to ensure that in the internal market, there are no barriers to the free movement of the labour force."
"However complicated it may be, we need to return to the liberalisation of the market in services, and we need to review the services directive that was adopted."
"The implementation of both these basic freedoms would help to offset the financial deficits created by the demographic process."
"Of course, we should also adopt a non-discriminatory attitude towards gender and age. Thank you."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, it is interesting how we often see the declining birth rate etc. as a problem."
"This is not necessarily the case if it means that we are then starting to share some of the inordinate wealth that we have at European Union level with people coming from other countries and that we look at technical innovation and how we can increase productivity and maybe even produce fewer of the rubbishy goods that clutter up our lives and our planet at the moment."
"Of course, there is also an issue about making the best use of the potential labour force."
"This is why the anti-discrimination directives in the field of employment are crucially important and why it is essential that Member States implement those properly."
"They should also look at the barriers to phased retirement - issues such as: if you cut your working hours, what does that do to your pension; what does it do to your life and access to benefits?"
"We also ought to consider what is happening in the current financial crisis with regard to a lot of our thinking in this area."
"We are likely to see more older workers being laid off, because people are not implementing the anti-discrimination legislation properly, with all the implications for many of them of perhaps never getting back into work."
"There will be others who will find it even more difficult to start their working lives or to find promotion to build up their pensions: all those aspects of what happens if you are not working for a period of time."
"There is the question of disaffection amongst the young who cannot find work, for whom it becomes more difficult, and of course the problems that many people will face when their private or occupational pension schemes are not able to pay out in the way that they thought they would."
"So we also need to look at the demographic situation in the context of the current crisis and how we are going to use this opportunity in terms of increasing training."
"We should use that as a way of helping people to improve their skills, perhaps to find pathways to less physically demanding work - something that we have been saying for a considerable period of time needs to be done."
"We should look at how we might increase the higher-education qualifications of a number of people who never had that opportunity in their youth."
"We now have the opportunity to look at certain of the elements that we know are problematic and really begin to look forward to how we are going to tackle the demographic situation."
"In our opinion, instead of being entitled 'demographic tendencies - economic and social impacts', this debate should be entitled 'economic and social policy and its impact on demographic tendencies'."
"The demographic tendency projections for a country or region should not be disassociated from the policies adopted in that country or region, given that these policies determine and condition the demographic development."
"For example, the 50-year projections are made based on assumptions that should be explained, including the economic policies determining the scenarios put forward."
"In other words, given the projections made, what we should be discussing today are the consequences for demographic development resulting from unemployment, increased job insecurity, deregulation of working time, a monetary policy focused on moderation and devaluation of wages."
"What we should be discussing today are the consequences of the European Union's interest rate policy on thousands and thousands of families who have taken out mortgages to buy houses, the consequences of liberalisation and privatisation on public services, and the consequences of low pensions on the independence and quality of life of millions of pensioners."
"What we should be discussing are those policies which promote the centralisation and concentration of wealth and the increase in social inequalities."
"In essence, what is actually at stake is the observance or non-observance of human rights, such as the right to food, employment, dignified wages, housing, health education and leisure."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, we are facing a crisis in Europe to which we will not find a solution until we face the fact that the crisis is of our own making."
"In the EU, we kill over one and a half million children before birth every year."
"We destroy our future and then wonder why we have a crisis."
"We talk about a fertility problem, but this is not a fertility problem: it is a refusal to let millions of babies conceived be born."
"Unless we are honest in identifying the problem, there can be no solution."
"The solutions are that we must respect life and support the family, in order for that life to find a nurturing environment."
"By taking these steps, we can begin to tackle the challenge of skewed demographics."
"Improvement will not happen overnight, but at this point we can still avert disaster."
"One should study the case of Japan closely."
"Two decades ago, it was the second largest economy in the world, and one of the most advanced."
"In 2007, the Japanese population peaked and entered decline."
"In 1995, twelve years before the downturn, Japan entered deflation as negative demographics began to take their toll."
"It has never got out of it."
"Japan is 20 years ahead of Europe in this, but it was also 20 years ahead of European countries in legalising abortion."
"We peak in 2025 - which is only 17 years away."
"I wonder if the deflation we are now entering, in 2008, is here to stay, with the banking crisis being replaced by a demographic crisis, which will be with us until we learn to respect life again."
"(NL) Madam President, I am delighted that the Council and Commission are issuing a statement about the economic and social impact of present demographic trends."
"Many politicians have a bad habit of thinking in the short term and of neglecting long-term policy."
"Our demographic challenge is a vital problem in the long term, which also requires long-term solutions."
"The average birth rate in women in the European Union is 1.5, which is too low to replace the current generations."
"This is also where the problem lies."
"One option is to reach out for an easy solution in the short term by pleading in favour of an even greater immigration wave from outside Europe."
"Whilst this may seem like a good idea in theory, day-to-day reality in our big cities bears witness to the total failure of lax immigration policy over the past 30 years."
"The European unemployment figure is 20 million, and still the Commission would like to import more immigrants."
"Might I, in fact, point out that the unemployment percentage among non-European immigrants is considerably higher than among the native people in the Member States?"
"A lack of time prevents me from mentioning the social problems, including the social breakdown, which large-scale immigration causes."
"What we need is policy in the Member States that supports young European families in their desire to have children."
"Tax measures are needed in the Member States in order to make having children more attractive."
"Child care should be improved and extended."
"We should also dare to contemplate the introduction of a wage for the stay-at-home-parent who chooses to commit most of his or her time to raising the children."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome this debate because it raises awareness, rather than arousing fear We must take action now, without waiting until tomorrow."
"Demographic change has its causes, consequences and challenges, which include falling population levels, fewer people in gainful employment and the likelihood of us living longer."
"The children born during the next few minutes may live to the age of 100."
"Indeed, this will be the case for half of these children."
"The population is ageing and we are having fewer children."
"This is resulting in dramatic changes to the age structure and the population structure."
"We in this House are faced by new infrastructure requirements, new requirements on public services and on business, education and social systems."
"This is an ageing continent."
"Jean-Claude Juncker once said, 'If we do not rapidly redesign our social, pension and health systems so that they are fit for the future, we will become the losers in the globalisation process, instead of the winners.'"
"What is to be done?"
"There is a great deal to do."
"Ensuring that people have a good work-life balance."
"No longer forcing people to give up working."
"New forms of care, child care and mobile services, such as meals on wheels, are required."
"In all Member States, responsibility for financing care must be taken away from social security systems and become a community responsibility."
"We are facing a challenge in the field of education."
"Our goal should be to become the most child-friendly and people-friendly continent in the world."
"We must credit time spent bringing up children and providing other forms of care, because 80% of carers are family members."
"Equal pay for equal work is also important."
"Much remains to be done and our problems have a wide range of different causes."
"(FR) Madam President, Minister, I have a few words to say: the stumbling block that we will encounter when tackling this demographic challenge is that the number of working people is falling."
"Two figures: in 2010, there will be 217 million people of working age, and in 2050 this figure will be 180 million; a deficit of almost 36 million people."
"Should we fear a shortage of labour?"
"Should we fear an imbalance between the working population and those who are dependent?"
"We are suggesting two solutions to this problem, which aim to achieve optimal management of human resources."
"Firstly, full employment."
"We must work towards full employment."
"There are currently very significant employment opportunities, given the under-employment among young people, women, over-55s and underqualified individuals."
"We are witnessing a huge waste of skills."
"We may well find that if employment levels among women and those aged between 55 and 65 increase, by 2050, to rates similar to the best in Europe, we could make up for this shortage of labour."
"Finally, lifelong education and training."
"We would like to work towards an optimal length of working life."
"It is unacceptable that a worker, a project manager, a 50-year old manager has little more by way of career prospects than stagnation."
"The social responsibility of our firms is at stake here."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the world population has doubled within a few decades with devastating consequences for the planet and so the fact that the European trend is at least partly different is a positive point."
"There are problems in terms of social welfare, certainly, but the answer is not to encourage people to have more children, but rather to raise the retirement age, to eliminate discrimination against older people in countries such as Italy where the disincentives to working after retirement age are so high as to make pensions into obligations rather than rights."
"On the world stage, I call upon the Presidency, in particular, to take action to bring about the convening of the new United Nations conference on population which has, for years now, been blocked because of pressure by states such as the Vatican State and by those who fear responsible policies on the provision of information on sex and family planning."
"(PL) Madam President, Europe's demographic trends have been deeply alarming for over a dozen years now."
"The replacement fertility rate is 2.16."
"In Poland this rate is 1.2."
"At the same time, the progress of medicine and healthier lifestyles mean that people live longer."
"Europe is getting older, but it is also dying out."
"By 2030, the ratio of working to non-working population will be 1 : 2."
"Anti-family, socio-economic policies, the promotion of family models with few children and childless marriages by the media, as well as policies conducive to family breakdown, are significant causes of the adverse demographic changes in Europe."
"Their most important outcomes will be a shortage of workers in the labour market, threatening economic development, a dramatic loss of pension system efficiency and increased cost of health care systems due to the special needs of an ageing society."
"(SK) I welcome the debate on these issues and I feel that it is particularly important now, when we must solve both a financial and an economic crisis at the same time."
"Demographic trends show that we have an ageing population, due to a combination of improvements to health care and falling birth rates."
"Therefore, we have to prepare for this reality and to make provision in the relevant areas."
"In the social area, it will be a relatively difficult matter to provide pensions."
"In the area of health, we must think how to provide treatments, especially for diseases associated with old age."
"We know, for example, that up to two thirds of cancers are associated with an age of over 60."
"The sustainability of the social system will require increased, improved and better-adapted conditions of employment for older people."
"This mainly concerns women over 55 and men in the age range from 55 to 64."
"It is possible to make up for the population loss through immigration of young people from third countries, but we must try, above all, to create the conditions for stabilising the population of young educated people who we are currently losing to the USA."
"In view of the worsening reproductive health of young women, we should support assisted reproduction."
"Many young families cannot afford this."
"In my opinion, we will not be able to comply with the Lisbon strategy."
"Let us try at least to renew the idea of a European family support alliance, either through tax bonuses or through improved facilities for pre-school children."
"Maternity leave should be provided at full pay and not at the minimum level."
"(RO) Minister, I apologise for contradicting you, but we have several problems, not just one."
"We do not only have demographic problems, but political, social and ethical ones too."
"We state that we want a higher birth rate, but 30% of children already born live below the poverty line."
"The consequences for the future will be poor education, bad jobs, lower productivity and small insurance contributions."
"The Council's position on the Working Time Directive blatantly contradicts the intentions of achieving a balance between work and private life."
"Infertility is a condition which is recognised by the World Health Organisation, but not by many Member States."
"As a result, insurance does not cover the cost of treatment."
"To pay for a single attempt at IVF in Romania, a person earning an average salary and saving all of it would need to work for nine months."
"3-4 attempts are required for conception and then another nine months before the child is born."
"Fellow Members, the most effective solution would be for us to promote a consistent policy among states and to ensure equivalence among the statements made and measures adopted."
"(FI) Madam President, the challenges posed by demographic trends seem especially great in the sparsely populated areas of the north."
"Migration takes young and educated people out of a region, whilst the ageing population quickly grows in relation to the rest."
"This results in increased costs for organising social and health care services, a problem exacerbated by the long distances involved."
"New technology and innovation have, however, succeeded in establishing new services to help the ageing population and which can be exploited throughout the Union."
"Another way to turn challenges into opportunities is effective regional policy."
"Effective regional policy is a way to make use of the opportunities that areas provide, create new jobs and deliver added value for Europe as a whole."
"At the same time, trends in population can be made a more positive phenomenon."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Jouyet, ladies and gentlemen, when this House discussed the effects of demographic developments before the summer, the full extent of the current economic crisis had not yet hit us."
"This crisis will increase pressure on our social systems."
"As a result of expected growth in unemployment, some relaxation may perhaps be expected within the labour market in the short term."
"In the long term, however, this does not solve the specific problem of an ageing population."
"If a worsening economic climate brings increased pressure to bear on the older workers to leave the labour market prematurely, we shall lapse into old errors."
"The emphasis should now remain, as it should do in future, on flexible pension arrangements on a voluntary basis, combined with organising work in such a way as to ensure that continuing to work longer becomes a real option."
"The financial crisis has demonstrated once again why we must handle pension funds wisely."
"The sustainability of the pension system, aligned to both demographic and economic developments and based on risk-avoiding investment strategies in the long term, should be accorded high priority."
"Additionally, the European Commission should turn its attention to regulating and monitoring pan-European pension products."
"(SK) The changing lifestyle of the younger generation is such that after completion of studies, everyone wants to spend some years travelling and then building their career."
"By this time, young people, including young women, are over the age of 30 and most of them then produce only one offspring."
"A family is seen today as a negative burden and, in addition to this, young men are not capable of promising marriage and security to women."
"The number of abortions is at an all-time high and a large proportion of women use hormonal contraceptives, so the number of women who are actually physiologically capable of conceiving children is very small."
"The fertility index in European countries varies between 1.1 and 1.3."
"Only France, which has long provided financial support for families, has an index approaching 2."
"A recent European congress on the family at the University of Ružomberok ..."
"Madam President, it seems we will all live longer but enjoy fewer grandchildren."
"I suppose the reasons why that is the case are very complex and varied."
"I think children are seen as a 'problem' and you hear that when you talk to people who do not have children."
"We also talk about a child care 'problem' rather than a 'solution'."
"Older people, too, feel that they are a burden and worry about who will look after them into their old age."
"I think that those of us in the middle somewhere fear this impending doom because there will be even fewer people around to pay for our pensions and to look after us when we, too, are unable to do so."
"The role of carers in society, as Marian Harkin rightly pointed out, is totally undervalued and that needs to change."
"And I wonder - listening to tonight's debate - in the context of the financial and economic crisis, can the Commission perhaps answer this question, and see that this problem of the demographic trend could actually get worse because of the situation we are now in?"
"That would be regrettable."
"(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, the European Union needs to be prepared to face up to the demographic challenges."
"Social Europe needs to be able to meet the expectations of its citizens by offering good-quality education, an efficient and accessible health care system and jobs which support a decent living and the guarantee of a decent pension on retirement."
"The EU has an ageing population."
"At the same time, there are few Member States where the birth rate has grown, apart from Ireland and France which have performed well in this area as a result of specific policies that have been adopted."
"At the same time, although the infant mortality rate has fallen at Community level to 4.7 in a thousand inhabitants, there are still some Member States where this figure is 12 in a thousand inhabitants."
"Europe needs to invest in health, education and social welfare."
"Guaranteeing well-paid jobs means a decent living for workers, but it also guarantees the resources required to pay for pensions."
"The pension system is a system based on solidarity between the generations."
"Madam President, the European Union is an ageing society."
"There are many people in the EU who choose to advance professionally instead of concentrating on their family lives, until it is far too late for them to have children."
"Having recently become a grandfather, I am a fierce advocate of an Estonian family planning measure that allows one of the parents to stay at home for 18 months after the birth of their child, guaranteeing social benefits more or less equal to the parent's salary before his or her leave - the parental allowance."
"It is my strong opinion that, unless we want to burden our children with unreasonably high taxes, we ought to start implementing a similar approach across the EU."
"In Estonia, for example, such a policy has brought the nation out of a seemingly interminable decrease in population."
"Madam President, the most important work done by any citizen is the rearing of the next generation."
"And, without any hectoring or lecturing of the young women of today, married or single, what we need to do is restore the freedom of choice to all women who want to stay at home to have the second or third child and to ensure that they are not forced to remain in employment because of economic and financial circumstances."
"We must ensure that full pension credits or a parental pension or a maternal pension are preserved for the women working in the home so that their old age will be financially secure and that they can be properly rewarded by the state for doing that most important work for all of us: rearing the next generation."
"On another point, given the increased average number of healthy years available to most of us, the compulsory retirement age - the traditional retirement age - of 65 must be revisited, and revisited urgently."
"On average, women are now well into their thirties when they give birth to their first child."
"We must review this situation as quickly as possible."
"(PL) Madam President, we are all aware that European society is ageing, but are we all aware what consequences this will have for our economy and for our labour market?"
"In an era of globalisation, demographic problems acquire a much broader dimension."
"For this reason, the European Union needs integrated action on a large number of levels."
"On the one hand, we must ensure that the goals of the Lisbon Strategy are attained, strive to raise employment levels, increase the participation of women in the labour market and arrest the early retirement trend."
"We must also place greater emphasis on education, especially in engineering and information technology, essential for a knowledge-based economy."
"It is also vital to promote life-long education and to prepare workers for being open to new challenges."
"Madam President, I will try to adhere to your advice."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate has been very fruitful and it is clear from the various interventions that there are multiple points to address if this demographic challenge is to be met."
"Various courses of action can complement each other, as I shall describe later."
"To a certain extent, it is true that we must increase employment rates, and it is true that we will need immigration in order to solve this demographic deficit, and it is also important that immigration be controlled and organised."
"It is also true that we need family policies and support for the existing birth rate, and there is a requirement to care for elderly people and to improve the way in which they are treated."
"In this context, we must pay close attention to the development of education infrastructure, child care and the alleviation of dependency in the elderly."
"As several speakers have said, we must consider our strengths, in particular, new information technologies and research and development, with all the flexibility available in medical and health care services, and all that can be done to assist with prenatal diagnosis, early years assistance and community child care."
"There are therefore several challenges, but we already have the resources to tackle this demographic deficit."
"We must be ready to monitor the consequences of demographic change, as was emphasised in the debate."
"We need to oversee the viability of our social security and pension systems, which are one of the characteristic features of the European solidarity model."
"We must take long-term measures, despite the economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing at the moment, in order to ensure that these systems are viable, and we must also consider the future effects of this demographic change on various aspects of labour organisation."
"Mr Cappato used a specific example to illustrate this point, and he is right to do so."
"In conclusion, I believe that the Commission, as Commissioner Potočnik will undoubtedly say, Parliament and Council must continue to engage in dialogue in the same spirit that pervaded the debate today."
"Europe undoubtedly faces a long-term challenge, and we must anticipate, organise ourselves and not allow the economic and financial crisis to prevent us from taking action and initiating reform."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, we have heard today a clear message that we have a very serious challenge - that of the ageing of society."
"In many ways, the 21st century is an era of fragility, and we have to deal with this."
"We all have to do everything possible."
"As was mentioned, longevity should be a reward and not a punishment."
"It was also mentioned that it would be consistent to do this in the context of the Lisbon Agenda, and I agree."
"We can understand the Lisbon Agenda in a simple way, going towards a knowledge-based society and being concerned about sustainability, whether it be in relation to social security, the environment or the economy."
"What we have learnt from this crisis is that even the profits have to be clearly sustainable."
"So the present financial crisis should not divert our attention from any of the problems which we have been patiently discussing in recent years, including the problem which we are discussing today."
"It is only one additional problem."
"When we have dealt with it, we have to come out of the financial crisis with a structure that is capable of dealing with all the challenges which the 21st century brings us."
"So it is important that in this context, we are aware of all the possible aspects of sustainability - sustainability of the planet on which we live, between living beings on the planet, between us humans and between generations, which is very much the essence of the demographic question which we are discussing today."
"Our policies should definitely address this."
"The demographic forum to be held on 24 and 25 November - which I mentioned in my opening address - is certainly one good opportunity to do so."
"We should certainly continue the dialogue between the Council, Member States, Parliament and the Commission."
"Your discussions today prove that the debate is very timely."
"I would like to thank you on behalf of the Commission for those views."
"All the things you have mentioned are extremely important - promoting demographic renewal, reconciliation of family and working life, the questions of carers, mobility and anti-discrimination and other policies."
"All this is valid when we talk about this problem."
"The debate is closed."
"Social security systems and pensions (short presentation)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Stauner, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the future of social security systems and pensions: their financing and the trend towards individualisation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, preparing an initiative report on the subject of the future of social security systems and pensions is a fascinating task because this area is so topical and so complex."
"However, it involves the significant risk of the report becoming a long wish list and catalogue of requirements for all right-thinking people."
"We did not succumb to this temptation, as the relatively brief and highly technical text, which carefully avoids flowery wording, indicates at first glance."
"I would therefore like to thank all my fellow Members, in particular the shadow rapporteurs and Mrs Lulling, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for their self-discipline."
"My aim was to produce a report which provides a description of the developments over the next 30 to 40 years for all decision makers and interested parties and which offers food for thought and recommendations for action for the individual areas of social policy."
"Social security and pension systems in the Member States have traditionally been designed, developed and financed in very different ways, which is why it will not be possible to harmonise them at an EU level."
"Nevertheless, all of the systems are in difficulty because of demographic developments and the changes to the labour market resulting from globalisation."
"This means that reforms are necessary in every case."
"Scientific findings have shown that continuing as before is not an option for any of the existing systems."
"That is the first important result."
"The type of reforms needed in each Member State obviously varies depending on the structure of each system."
"In our opinion, all the systems need, among other things, more and improved measures to bring about a better work-life balance, which will help to prevent the employment rate from falling, and which will ensure that social problems are not aggravated by the large-scale immigration of workers."
"Secondly, despite the introduction of so-called atypical employment relationships, we must retain the traditional model of full-time employment for an unlimited period, because this is the only way of guaranteeing stability for living conditions and social security systems."
"Thirdly, as well as ensuring that social spending is financially secure through the use of joint contributions and hybrid fund-based solutions, we must put the focus on social investment."
"Fourthly, we must improve productivity and increase the ability to innovate, because in Europe we are reliant on our human capital."
"Fifthly, we must ensure that high-quality health care is available to everyone, with medical progress and falling contributions guaranteeing basic care for all citizens."
"Sixthly, special measures must be introduced to protect women against the specific risks which they are exposed to, in particular poverty in old age, by crediting child care and family care time in pension insurance."
"A sense of solidarity across generations and social groups must lie at the heart of all our efforts in future."
"This is particularly true in a world characterised by change resulting from globalisation, which is becoming increasingly depersonalised and anonymous."
"Solidarity and subsidiarity are the basic principles of the European social model."
"In this context, we must ensure that globalisation has a social side, so that well-qualified and adaptable workers can support themselves and their families with dignity, receive high-quality health care if they are ill and have financial security in old age."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, despite being drafted before the current turmoil erupted on our financial markets and the economic downturn became apparent, this report is remarkably timely and also relevant."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her sound work."
"The report underscores the long-term social demographic and economic changes that are driving the modernisation and reform of our social protection schemes."
"It highlights the importance of our shared values in the field of social protection."
"It also shows how they can help to make our pension and health care systems sustainable."
"More people working more and longer is the key of the long-term adequacy and sustainability of social protection."
"It is also a win-win strategy."
"The report links sustainable, adequate social protection with the Lisbon Strategy and our commitment to guarantee sustainable public finances."
"The renewed social agenda proposed by the Commission gives substance to that link by advocating a broad holistic approach to future social policies and priorities."
"I welcome the emphasis on promoting women's full integration into our labour markets and on fighting all forms of discrimination to ensure that everybody can acquire adequate social security and pension rights in particular."
"The report emphasises the need to combine the move to funded pensions in many Member States with sound national and EU regulatory frameworks for effective supervision and careful monitoring of outcomes for citizens."
"That is a very timely message."
"Access to quality medical treatment and preventive care is a cornerstone of EU social models."
"It is both a goal to be attained for itself and a necessary condition for a productive labour force to exist in a phase of rapid population ageing."
"The Commission shares your concern about health inequalities and the need to guarantee high-quality health care for all and solidarity financing covering the whole population."
"These points will be taken up in a Commission communication on health inequalities to come out next year."
"The report is a strong plea for us all, not only to keep working to achieve our basic objectives of access for all, solidarity, adequacy and sustainability, but also to work to strengthen them through modernisation."
"The Commission will provide its full response to the financial crisis and the downturn in the real economy in a communication to be published on 26 November."
"It will also elaborate on the constructive social and economic role of social protection in the joint report on social protection and inclusion for 2009."
"May I assure you of the Commission's willingness to look again at the various points in this report in close cooperation with Parliament."
"This item is now closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 20 November 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Sadly, population ageing and population shrinkage are the inescapable future of Europe."
"Demographers say that the birth rate will not ensure generational replacement, while average life expectancy will increase."
"The low birth rate is associated with the difficulty of combining professional work with family life - we lack the necessary number of crèches and kindergartens, as well as economic support for families."
"By the end of 2030, the ratio of working to non-working population will probably reach 2:1."
"Mitigating the consequences of the shrinkage of working population through immigration is only one possible solution."
"It will also lead to increased ethnic, cultural and religious diversity."
"We must therefore raise employment levels among the disabled and older people (by arranging for training and retraining)."
"Retirement must also be made more flexible, through the introduction of voluntary retirement, change of employment and the use of new technologies."
"Member States must also conduct a balanced financial policy, dividing the tax burden fairly between workers, consumers and businesses."
"Demographic changes will have a major impact on public expenditure on retirement and old age pensions, which can be mitigated by being partly privately funded."
"Expenditure on health care will also rise."
"In the circumstances, providing the populations of Member States with health care and appropriate benefits delivered at an appropriate level is a task requiring immediate action on many social and governmental levels."
"HIV/AIDS: Early Diagnosis and Early Care (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on HIV/AIDS: Early diagnosis and early care."
"Madam President, Commissioner Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, it is twenty five years since HIV was discovered."
"Today, it is of the utmost importance, now that the epidemic has claimed more than 25 million lives, that the European Union reaffirm its commitment to combat the global HIV/AIDS pandemic."
"Universal access to prevention, testing, early treatment and support in this field is essential, and the European Parliament, your House, emphasised this in its resolution of 24 April 2007."
"There is an urgent need to increase the rate of development, and also to increase implementation of prevention, information, education and awareness campaigns, and to invest in research and development of new prevention and testing strategies, which must be kept up-to-date with changes in the nature of the pandemic."
"In particular, it is of prime importance that testing and treatment are done as early as possible, and that anti-retroviral drugs are made available at an affordable price. When diagnosis is made too late, or if the immune system is too badly damaged by the disease, patients have an increased risk of death in the four years following diagnosis."
"In order to screen earlier, it is necessary to use new strategies and tools, such as rapid screening tests."
"It would be useful to offer testing more widely, providing that patients consent, of course."
"It is useful to remember that these rapid screening tests can be carried out where there is no medical laboratory, and that the results may be given to patients within a relatively short time."
"In order to encourage people living with HIV/AIDS to be tested early, it is also essential to overcome discrimination barriers."
"The fear of the stigma attached to a positive test result can prevent patients from accessing early screening."
"For this reason, the European Union must speak out clearly and consistently against all forms of discrimination against people living with HIV anywhere in the world."
"This strongly held conviction is shared by the French President Nicolas Sarkozy and by Bernard Kouchner, who have brought this matter to the attention of the United Nations."
"HIV is to be treated as a transmissible but non-contagious disease, and any restrictions on freedom of access, travel and residence for HIV positive people, because of their HIV status, are counterproductive."
"Any such practices will dissuade patients from obtaining screening and treatment, which is harmful to the individual and to society."
"In conclusion, I should like to make two observations."
"The first is that our common goal is as follows: people who test positive for HIV must receive high-quality treatment, regardless of their origin, nationality, opinions, age, sex, sexual orientation, religion or any other factor."
"The second observation is that, in this context, international coordination is essential if this pandemic is to be defeated."
"I would like to pay tribute to the EuroHIV programme, which has, since 1984, been disseminating essential information about HIV/AIDS to the WHO, UNAIDS and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control."
"In order to make prevention, screening and early treatment available to all, in order that people with the disease are no longer stigmatised or discriminated against, in order that the countries of the South have proper access to drugs, cooperation between UN agencies and regional agencies must be increased."
"More than ever, the European Union must be involved in this fight."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would say to the honourable Members and to Minister Jouyet that, as we approach World AIDS Day on 1 December 2008, this plenary session provides a good opportunity to reflect on some significant achievements in combating HIV/AIDS and to focus on the serious challenges that lie ahead."
"This year's Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded to two European researchers at the Pasteur Institute - Professor Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Professor Luc Montagnier, who were the first to isolate the Human Immunodeficiency Virus back in 1983."
"That landmark discovery paved the way for many important developments and diagnostics, and the treatment of HIV infections, and allowed us to understand more about the pathogenesis of HIV infections and its devastating consequences."
"However, 25 years later, we still do not have a cure for HIV/AIDS and still witness millions of new infections per year worldwide, including tens of thousands of new infections in Europe."
"How can this happen?"
"It is well known how HIV transmission can be effectively prevented."
"Successful campaigns in the 1980s and the early 1990s have shown that awareness and knowledge are essential elements of prevention strategies against HIV infections."
"Determined political leadership and civil responsibility are two further elementary prerequisites for successfully combating HIV/AIDS - as is an open and constructive partnership with the stakeholders."
"Today's plenary session is also an excellent time to reaffirm our political commitment - a time to be ambitious."
"I should add that I appreciate very much the European Parliament's commitment in keeping HIV/AIDS high on the political agenda."
"Indeed, we recently had a very useful exchange of views on HIV/AIDS in a round-table meeting organised by Vice-President Miguel-Angel Martínez Martínez and Zita Gurmai on the need for HIV testing and subsequent early 'state of the art' care and support."
"Experts estimate that an average of 30% of people in Europe infected with HIV are not aware of their status."
"That incredible figure carries two risks: first for the person concerned, since he or she may not receive treatment and care on time; and second for his or her partner(s), who may be exposed to the infection."
"So what can we as politicians do to address and overcome this situation?"
"Our common humanistic core values and a strong commitment to human values, solidarity and our position against discrimination must be the basis of all policies to fight HIV/AIDS, and should be the foundation for all activities in combating the disease."
"The European position and response is clear: we concentrate on prevention and raising awareness; we promote HIV testing and access to treatment and care for all in need; we fight for affordable medication; we oppose and fight any form of discrimination or stigmatisation; we seek to identify best practice and support civil society."
"In areas within our political responsibility, we have to create the conditions for effective actions on the ground, serving both society and people living with HIV and AIDS."
"Clearly we cannot be complacent."
"We have to keep up the momentum."
"The EU also looks beyond its borders to the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing countries, which represent an exceptional challenge to social growth and development."
"Eastern Europe and Central Asia continue to experience the fastest growth of the epidemic in the world."
"In this context, we reaffirm our commitment to supporting partner countries in scaling-up towards universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support."
"On behalf of the Commission, I welcome the resolution on early diagnosis and early care of HIV/AIDS and fully endorse and support the principle of breaking down barriers to HIV testing, treatment and care."
"The Commission further encourages people to use the possibility of HIV testing and reiterates to Member States the need to establish testing centres that meet international standards and operate according to agreed principles."
"The Commission is currently developing its second strategy on combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and also our near neighbourhood, which will further concentrate on prevention and will focus on the regions and groups most affected by the epidemics."
"However, what a successful prevention approach needs most of all is openness and tolerance on a political and societal level: openness to the realities of our lives today, of sexuality and behaviours; openness to means of harm reduction; openness to fight inequalities, discrimination and suppression; and openness to other cultures and habits."
"In facing up to the challenge of HIV/AIDS, the Commission will continue to play its role to the full."
"I know that we have Parliament's support in this endeavour, and we treasure it highly."
"Let us continue together the strong political momentum, together with the Council, to ensure that we all live up to our responsibilities."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, in the United Kingdom, we have 80 000 people living with HIV and, as the Commissioner has said, 1 in 3 of those is undiagnosed."
"We also have 1 in every 360 pregnant women HIV positive."
"Ten per cent of new cases in Europe are multi-drug resistant strains, and that is heading in the direction of the 20% that we see in America."
"We see increasing numbers living with multi-drug resistant TB as well as with AIDS."
"The ECDC shows new cases of HIV infection doubled between 1999 and 2006."
"It showed 11% of cases are in young people aged between 15 and 24."
"We saw 53% heterosexual transmission, largely from people who originate from epidemic countries, but a third are men who have sex with men and, perhaps surprisingly, less than 10% are injecting drug users."
"But on top of all this - and I very much welcome what the minister said - we impose stigma."
"Stigma is a cruel added burden to the pain of the disease and, what is worse, it encourages people to hide and not to come forward for testing and treatment."
"The solutions stem from these figures, from these facts."
"We need early diagnosis, as everyone has so far said."
"We need confidential testing, we need education, we need the understanding that flows from that and can counter that stigma."
"We need the on-going research and development, and we need care because fewer people are actually dying of AIDS; more people are living with it."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I was very happy to hear the Commissioner mention the Round Table which I co-hosted and co-chaired."
"Miguel Angel Martínez and Commissioner Vassiliou also participated and were actively engaged in it."
"AIDS is one of the most serious diseases of our century."
"Within the European Union alone, 215 000 people were newly infected with HIV in the last 10 years."
"According to estimates this year, almost one third of the AIDS infection - as my good colleague mentioned - still remained undiagnosed, posing a real threat to the health of European citizens."
"It is high time to take concrete steps so we have put forward practical suggestions on how to combat HIV/AIDS effectively by focusing on evidence-based HIV/AIDS early diagnosis and early care."
"It is not only a health-related question."
"It is a strategic matter for the future enlargement of the EU and crucial in the field of neighbourhood and migration policy."
"We should combine the different EU policies to emphasise the right of each single European citizen to better health and living conditions, not forgetting the role of women."
"They are the most endangered groups when it comes to HIV/AIDS."
"Ensuring accurate monitoring surveillance of the disease is of the highest urgency."
"Early diagnosis and the reduction of barriers to testing are regarded as an urgent necessity."
"Steps must be taken to ensure access to free and anonymous testing in order to facilitate more people seeking testing."
"HIV/AIDS reduction strategies must be worked out in each Member State and these must focus on vulnerable groups and groups known to be at high risk."
"The strategy shall also include information and education campaigns on the preventing, testing and treatment of HIV/AIDS."
"We must recognise that increased investment in research and development for more effective therapeutic and preventive tools, such as vaccines and microbicides, will be essential to securing the long-term success of HIV and AIDS responses."
"Discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS must be effectively outmoded across the European Union."
"The struggle against HIV/AIDS must not result in any discriminatory effect on HIV-positive citizens, including restrictions that impact on their freedom of movement."
"The cross-party EP resolution tackles all the situations together."
"The aim is common and the enlarged Europe can become the initiator of enhanced international cooperation on evidence-based HIV/AIDS early diagnosis and early care in the near future."
"I am convinced that, if early diagnosis and an early care system work as a pilot programme, it may be possible to use it as a common European tool for other health-related policies."
"I am really thankful to all my colleagues who supported this initiative and worked on it."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, ever since I had the honour of drafting the report on combating HIV/AIDS within the EU and neighbouring countries, I have been very committed to this issue, with all its implications and ramifications, of people living with HIV."
"One year ago, in the framework of the conference 'HIV in Europe 2007', participants developed a comprehensive call to action on measures regarding how to effectively tackle HIV/AIDS in Europe."
"Some elements of this call are now also reflected in this joint motion for a resolution."
"The aim of this resolution is to contribute to the fight against HIV/AIDS on a political level."
"Therefore, it calls on the Council and the Commission to formulate a comprehensive strategy on HIV to promote early diagnosis, ensure early care and communicate the benefits of earlier care to all European citizens."
"It calls on the Commission to commit substantial resources to deliver the above-mentioned strategy and asks Member States to step up information and education campaigns on prevention, testing and treatment."
"I am aware that the Commission is planning to bring forward a new communication on combating HIV in the EU and the neighbourhood and also that Commissioner Vassiliou confirmed her personal commitment to take further action in this field."
"To conclude, this situation needs to be urgently tackled."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been working as a doctor fighting AIDS for 21 years and every year I still hear the same debates."
"From a clinical viewpoint, the situation is very clear: we have about 30 anti-retroviral drugs that are able to prolong the lives of those with the HIV virus."
"We do not have any drug that is able to destroy the virus and, as a result, in the West and in Europe, we have seen a decrease in mortality and an increase in the number of people living with the HIV virus, who can technically be described as 'potential vectors of infection'."
"This means that today, we have a greater risk of coming into contact with people with the HIV virus than in the past, because the number of HIV-positive survivors is increasing."
"In the midst of all this, what is being done?"
"Nothing."
"The majority of European countries have not had any stable prevention campaigns for years."
"Prophylactics cost a lot and let us give the words a precise, recognisable name: prophylactics cost a lot and are one of the main ways of preventing the HIV virus."
"That is without mentioning damage-reduction projects aimed particularly at drug addicts to prevent the sharing of needles."
"How many countries carry out projects of this kind nationally?"
"In Italy, 50% of confirmed AIDS diagnoses come at the same time as diagnoses of the HIV virus, which means that many people do not know they have HIV until they are ill."
"Where are the campaigns for increasing access to tests, which should be free and anonymous?"
"We know that if there is discrimination, people will try to hide, they will not go to have the test, and this will entail risks for their own health and the health of others."
"One last point: today, again, the Council has spoken of aid to the global South, but I would like to know what happened to the proposals made by Parliament when we voted for the most recent version of TRIPS, which committed the Commission and the Council to increase funds for combating AIDS in the global South and, in particular, to transfer technologies and to transfer pharmacological aid."
"Madam President, in 2006 over 86 000 newly-diagnosed HIV cases were reported, and over 13 000 AIDS cases were diagnosed in the WHO European region."
"In Western Europe, 10% of the new infections occurred amongst the 15-to-24 age group, and 25% of those newly infected were female."
"The main route of transmission was heterosexual contact, as the Commissioner has said."
"In Eastern Europe, the main route of transmission was via drug injection."
"Very worryingly, 27% of new infections there occurred in the 15-to-25 age group, and 41% of the newly-infected patients were female."
"Currently, 30% of HIV-infected patients do not know that they are infected and are responsible for over a half of all new HIV infections."
"In addition, late diagnosis implies late use of anti-retroviral therapy, with increasingly limited opportunities for the drugs to have effect."
"There is an urgent need for European-level guidance on HIV testing and counselling."
"We must have comprehensive and flexible guidance on best practice in reporting, in testing, in treatment and in care."
"In my own country, Ireland - while data on HIV and AIDS should be interpreted with caution owing to considerable under-reporting and late reporting - the total number of AIDS cases reported up to the end of December 2007 is almost 1 000."
"That figure is, however, expected to rise owing to that under-reporting."
"The cumulative number of HIV infections reported in the same period was 4 780."
"Prevention strategies need yet again to be top of the news, on the front pages of our e-newspapers."
"Complacency has set in."
"Fear of infection has evaporated."
"We need to spell out the facts, in an open and tolerant way."
"John Bowis is so right when he says that while fewer people are dying of AIDS, more and more are living with it."
"Madam President, I wish to congratulate the French Presidency for its commitment to the fight against AIDS and HIV, and also congratulate those who have spoken in the debate this evening."
"It is a late-night debate on an issue that actually affects every single one of us every single minute of every single day."
"As a gay man living in the 1970s and 1980s, I could so easily have contracted the HIV virus."
"I was lucky."
"I did not."
"However, I watched as swathes of generations were cut down by a virus and cut down by discrimination and stigmatisation."
"That is why the message we need to send tonight is that we are committed to making available treatment and to having early testing but, above and beyond all that, and the brilliant and excellent work Mr Bowis did as a Health Minister in a Conservative government, we have to say that what happens to you is as if it happens to me, or my daughter or my son."
"People do not go for early testing for one simple reason: fear of the discrimination that they will have to live with - that stigmatisation."
"I remember once in the early 1980s visiting a hospital to try and cheer up the patients - which I always failed to do! - and walking into an HIV unit to find that in one of the beds was one of my close friends."
"He could not even tell me that he was living and dying with an AIDS-related illness."
"That situation still exists, not only in our countries, but also on other continents."
"What happens on other continents affects us directly because, unless we engage with the communities most at risk, they will never hear the message."
"A sex worker who gets trafficked into the EU is as vulnerable as a visitor from the EU to Africa or one of the other continents."
"That is why I welcome this resolution."
"1 December 2008 is the 20th anniversary of International AIDS Day, but little changes except the lives that accumulate, that go past and are destroyed."
"That is why I congratulate the House, the Presidency and the Commission, and all of the speakers, for being here to send a signal that what happens to them happens to us."
"Madam President, I have come to realise that HIV-positive people are sometimes treated like lepers, not knowing that with early diagnosis and care they may be active members of society for a number of years before AIDS develops and the disease starts seriously to affect their lives."
"Such prejudice is a sign of ignorance."
"It is extremely important to promote support and understanding towards the HIV-infected."
"As a result, people would have more courage to have their viral infection diagnosed at an early stage instead of opting for a nuisance that might pose a threat to others."
"It is vital that HIV-positive people can be open about their condition with no fear of being discriminated against, so we can increase awareness and tolerance in society of HIV and AIDS."
"Madam President, HIV prevention and treatment capacity varies across different socio-economic and geopolitical settings."
"Promoting the early diagnosis of HIV infection should be a component of all comprehensive approaches to addressing AIDS."
"Even in countries where anti-retroviral treatment options are severely limited, important contributions to health can be achieved through the diagnosis and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and other opportunistic infections among HIV-infected persons."
"In a recent US research publication, it was found that the time between self-reported dates of HIV diagnosis and presentation for care had, in fact, increased."
"The interval between diagnosis and presentation was substantially greater among injection drug users than among other risk groups."
"Combined with this is a problem of the growing perception that AIDS is now a treatable condition, which undermines the public health message calling for frequent testing and prompt treatment of HIV."
"Madam President, I thank Michael Cashman for the passion he has brought to this debate."
"I am very glad that I stayed to listen to his words, and I hope that others will hear them and act upon them."
"My concern in relation to this issue is that the fear we had in the 1980s has been forgotten and, as a result, we are taking our eye off the situation, when there is a whole generation of people who did not grow up in the 1980s who need to hear the message again."
"The challenge for us all is to try and bring a message of prevention into the public domain while not bringing back the stigma that sometimes comes with it. We have to be able to do this, because while testing is vital and treatment is absolutely vital for those who have the disease, we also want to stop people getting AIDS, living with it and tragically dying from it."
"Madam President, Commissioner Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, this is a truly fascinating and, at times, moving debate."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Cashman for his striking account, and I know that he has often been in contact with Mrs Bachelot, who apologises that she cannot be here this evening and who has said that we must act as though we were all affected and that we must work with those communities that are most at risk."
"Mr Savi has also said that people should be able to talk freely about their condition."
"Mr Burke emphasised the value of tolerance and the importance of equality of access."
"Mrs McGuinness said, very pertinently, that we must not forget what happened during the 1980s."
"I should like to come back to what Mr Bowis said - and I believe this can be a common approach with full support - which is that an increasing number of people are living with AIDS now, and that there are increased levels of resistance to anti-retrovirals."
"We must therefore accept these two phenomena and because of this, we must, for the reasons you have given, oppose all forms of discrimination even more strongly."
"Secondly, we must do all we can, as all have agreed, to ensure that early diagnosis is available."
"Mrs Gurmai was entirely right to emphasise the fragility of women's situations and the need to promote prevention in particular."
"Mrs Doyle stressed the fact that the virus is developing in young people and that efforts at prevention must be strengthened while ensuring that freedom of movement is not hampered, and Mrs Gurmai agreed with this."
"These aspects all seem to me to be extremely important; transparency, Mr Cashman's remarks about anonymity, free medical care, improved distribution of condoms, equal access to testing for all population groups."
"The remarks of Mr Agnoletto, whose expertise in this field is widely known, told me that retroviral drugs will prolong life but that no drug could cure the disease, which means that we must improve preventative measures, whatever the cost."
"Mr Bowis also added that it is necessary to strengthen research and development."
"I believe that these are the aspects on which we should continue to work together, that we have the necessary resources, and I completely agree with Mr Andrejevs about the proposed resolution which aims to develop all aspects of early treatment."
"I believe this debate will encourage us to remain alert and vigilant, to combat all forms of discrimination and to act on what has happened in the past, and not to act as though the situation has returned to normal."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I took part in a conference either at the beginning of this week or last week - sometimes I am probably like you these days, a bit lost in time."
"It was a conference on poverty-related diseases."
"Of course, HIV and AIDS are among the three big killers nowadays, malaria and tuberculosis being the second and the third."
"Every year, five million people still die from these three diseases globally, which is the equivalent of the population of Denmark disappearing every year."
"The problem is so clearly still present that it would simply be immoral not to give enough attention to it."
"We have to do everything possible on the preventive campaigns."
"We have to do more because we have slept a bit there."
"We have to do everything possible to ensure early identification if somebody is infected."
"We have to do more to find a cure; we have to do more about taking care."
"Since, as you know, I am responsible for financing research in the Commission, I can clearly give a commitment that we will also, in future, use our funds to actively search for an HIV-AIDS vaccine."
"We have one excellent project which has now been running for many years."
"It is called the EDCTP."
"It is the clinical trials partnership with the sub-Saharan countries."
"It had a lot of problems at the beginning but now it is really running smoothly and only last year, in 2007, we gave a commitment here; the Member States are working here together with the Commission."
"All the Member States are cooperating with African member states in building their capacity."
"In one year alone, they committed between EUR 80 million and EUR 90 million and this is, of course, doubled because we commit the other half."
"So research should continue in this area too."
"Just as Commissioner Vassiliou, my colleague, is committed in her area, I am also committed in my area to continue in the search."
"One thing which was not mentioned here today, and I think it should be mentioned, is the importance of the neighbourhood policy and structural cohesion policy, because these are precisely the countries in Europe or in our neighbourhood where this is a critical issue."
"This could and should also be used for these purposes."
"To conclude: in simple terms we have a moral obligation as human beings to take action."
"I am really happy that our voice today was so clear."
"It was so united and even passionate."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 20 November 2008."
"Amendment of the single CMO Regulation (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the amendment of the single CMO regulation - C6-0314/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, we are tonight talking about the single CMO on wine."
"We actually very much support the idea of bringing all the common market organisations together into one organisation."
"However, we are concerned that we can identify exactly where the chapters on wine are, that we can access them properly and that, in the future, when we are dealing with wine and Member States are dealing with wine, that you do not open up the whole 20 odd chapters - which are included in the whole single CMO - at the same time."
"We have now had many meetings with the Commission to get reassurance on this."
"At the moment, you are probably at the stage of bringing all these CMOs together."
"We are seeking reassurance that we will be able to get the information we need."
"The industry itself, of course, is also concerned that it will be able to identify the rules within the single CMO."
"There is no doubt that the Commission is telling us that this will mean a reduction in bureaucracy."
"We very much welcome that, but we want reassurance that this is exactly the case."
"We have been told that the technical organisations that give information on wine to the Commission will be the same as they were previously and this will now work within the single CMO, so - provided this is the case and that we can actually go on to a computerised system in the future and identify all the regulations - we welcome this proposal."
"But we must be assured, at the end of the day, that this will actually be beneficial for the whole industry."
"I think there will be Members tonight who will be seeking that reassurance from the Commission."
"We look forward to the Commission giving us these answers."
"I actually think that the way forward is to reduce bureaucracy in the Commission and in Europe."
"What we seek now is those reassurances."
"I welcome the single CMO."
"I am sure there will be other Members here who have comments to make."
"What is absolutely apparent is that we must get this voted on now so that Parliament gives its opinion and the Commission can come forward and conclude this."
"I therefore recommend this to the House."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and Chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Parish, and the members of the Committee on Agriculture, for the report."
"I could be very short and just reassure you but I have to read the speaking points."
"We have been working very hard at simplifying the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"A single common market organisation (CMO) covering all agricultural sectors is a keystone of this effort."
"It allows for streamlining legislation across sectors whilst taking into account the specifications of particular products."
"It has also substantially reduced the volume of CAP legislation."
"This Commission proposal aims at completing the single CMO project by integrating the wine sector also."
"Without wine, the single CMO would simply remain incomplete."
"We would stop part way through the process and lose many of the benefits of the projects."
"We have always intended to include wine."
"Indeed, both the initial single CMO proposal and the recent wine reform were drafted and adopted on that basis."
"I am glad to say that the European Parliament has always fully endorsed the single CMO project, including the integration of fruit and vegetables and wine after the completion of the reforms in those sectors."
"The single CMO, and its management committee, has been working very well for other sectors and there has been no particular criticism of it."
"The proposal for integration might seem complex at first sight."
"But this is inherent in the nature of amending legislation."
"After incorporation, consolidated versions of the single CMO will become available, which will show very clearly the wine provisions."
"The integration of the single CMO will not make any substantive changes to the policy decided in the wine reform."
"The services of my colleague, Mrs Fischer Boel, will work hard with the European Parliament and the Council to ensure that this is the case."
"We did this very successfully during the integration of the equally complex fruit and vegetables sector."
"I would therefore ask you to help the Commission, to help my colleague, to continue her and our simplification work and give a positive opinion on this proposal."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I must say that I am disappointed by your remarks because we have entered into discussions with the Commission on the basis of what Neil Parish has said."
"I had hoped for something more concrete than simply the constant repetition of the fact that it will become simpler."
"It will not become simpler."
"A common market organisation for wine will be the 21st market organisation in an extensive series."
"The objective of making things simpler by reducing bureaucracy is not something that I or the wine growers of Europe are able to recognise."
"In future, everyone who wants to find out something about the wine sector must search through a long regulation, the common market organisation for all the agricultural products, which previously consisted of 204 articles and an appendix that is twice as long, to find all the points which refer to wine, across 98 articles with 21 headings and the 10 accompanying appendices."
"This is not a reduction in bureaucracy, Commissioner."
"This is bureaucracy in its purest form."
"I call on the Commission to at least simplify the technical applications, because it is possible to do so."
"Younger colleagues of mine, such as Anja Weisgerber, tell me that it must be possible."
"Please could the Commission consider this?"
"A technical simplification would include, for example, a search tool on the Commission's website which would allow people to download and print only those parts of the common market organisation which are relevant for their particular agricultural products."
"Neither wine growers nor milk producers are interested in the special regulations on fruit and vegetables or hemp, and vice versa."
"We must make use of these technical possibilities in order to make things simpler."
"In future, whenever a change is made in one agricultural area, there is the possibility that changes will be made in another area."
"This means that when an amendment is made in the milk sector and the single CMO is modified, all farmers and wine growers must make sure that a change has not been quickly pushed through in their area."
"I would like to ask two specific questions, Madam President."
"Commissioner, in future who will be the monitor? ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Madam President, the single CMO Regulation has been in force since December 2006."
"The Commission describes this as an essential component in the plans to streamline and simplify the common agricultural policy."
"Some people, myself included, regard this statement as highly debatable."
"However, I do not believe that this is the time or the place."
"We had a debate at the time and yet, despite this Regulation having only been in force for a few months, we are now voting on its amendment."
"Today we are adding even more pages by incorporating Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 on the common organisation of the market in wine."
"This Regulation will be repealed by the present proposal and its substance will be fully incorporated into the single CMO Regulation."
"This sector has conveyed to us, myself included, its concern about the wine CMO articles being scattered among the various chapters of the single CMO Regulation and about the risk of this diluting the specific nature of this product."
"We believe that this incorporation is actually inevitable and we have all had the opportunity to read the letter sent by the Commissioner to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Parish, assuring him that this legislative measure will not fundamentally alter the rules in this sector."
"This should be solely a technical incorporation which will in no way affect the content."
"As a result, while understanding and sharing some of the misgivings, I can only support Mr Parish's report."
"Madam President, we are actually voting here for a provision which will incorporate winegrowing legislation into the provisions for the common organisation of agriculture on a principle of 'scattered tea'."
"Wine legislation, despite its fundamentally specialist nature, must, in other words, be randomly sprayed between lamb, cereals, goats, fruit and vegetables."
"The Federation of Winegrowers from the Czech Republic has pointed out that a small producer from South Moravia with an output of perhaps 2 000 litres of wine will find it hard to deal with the enormous, impenetrable and widely-scattered body of legislation applying to his wine."
"I have received requests for help, not only from our 20 000 strong federation of winegrowers but also from the federations of winegrowers in Spain, France, Italy and Germany which belong to the Assembly of European Wine Regions (AREV)."
"The Commission, however, has had the temerity to turn a blind eye to this."
"The DG AGRI insisted that it knew nothing and that winegrowers were happy."
"And now that Commissioner Boel has conceded that winegrowers are not happy, she tells us that nothing can be done."
"Something can actually be done, however, because we are the Parliament."
"Let us either create a transparent chapter for wine within agricultural legislation or reject the report."
"We must not allow arrogant officials to burden the lives of winegrowers, who themselves, through their taxes, help to pay the wages of the same officials."
"(ES) Madam President, the European Commission has presented this amendment to the single CMO Regulation, saying that this will now include wine in a new presentation that supposedly tries to avoid paperwork and red tape."
"However, producers tell us that it will create more confusion, that it makes them concerned about a lack of legal certainty, and that it will not change the basis of the wine CMO (as laid down by law, this could not actually happen without passing through this House, even if only for the purpose of consultation)."
"In any event, it must be said that the wine CMO is more than a market CMO."
"It involves other requirements, such as the labelling issue."
"Therefore, if milk is not the same as vegetables, and vegetables are not the same as cereals, and clearly cereals are not the same as wine, why are we putting them together as if they had some connection?"
"I believe that this proposal has some technical shortcomings which, as I have said, have been denounced by producers."
"I wonder what will happen now if, for example, a proposal is made to amend part of this single CMO Regulation."
"Will this open the door to all the other sectors?"
"Will it be possible to amend a sector without us realising?"
"Will the door be open to the amendment of each and every one of the sectors included?"
"I believe that we cannot move a motion of confidence in the European Commission if the Commission does not guarantee that, firstly, there will be a search engine - as requested by Mrs Klaß - guaranteeing producers security, speed and confidence when searching the Regulation and, secondly, if the Commission does not guarantee that there will be legal certainty so that a door cannot be opened or left open constantly to the amendment of any CMO which is included."
"With this proposal, the European Commission is presenting a fait accompli, but they cannot say that we did not warm them that this would be a mistake and that it would not, in any way, avoid paperwork or red tape, but that it will actually create more paperwork and red tape and also more legal uncertainty, which is what is worrying producers most."
"(FR) Madam President, under a pretext of simplification, the European Commission is relentlessly pursuing integration of all CMOs for all products, from wheat to chicken, from fruit and vegetables to tobacco, into a single CMO."
"The result was a large tome amounting to several hundred pages, in which one could seek the pertinent information in vain."
"As has already been said, the wine sector, because of its extremely specific requirements, has been subject to very detailed regulation, which differs from that pertaining to other products and which ensured clarity and transparency."
"Because of this, it was understood that the wine CMO would remain separate."
"However, today it appears that the wine CMO has been swallowed up in this large volume."
"The Commission does not wish to let go of this issue, as wine and wine products are the last to remain outside this tangle that is the single CMO."
"If it is legally impossible to take a step backwards, and if we must submit to this for reasons that are not entirely reasonable, Madam President, I would at least like to see Mrs Klaß's suggestions followed."
"Madam President, I really will not take a minute because, being from Ireland, I have not been lobbied by wine producers."
"I think there is a general concern about the pulling together of so many different sectors in a single CMO."
"We really will not know if it works until it is done."
"I will therefore listen to the concerns of those who know more about the wine sector, while realising that we do have to move this process on."
"I hope that we will get better reassurances from the Commission because we do need to listen to the concerns of the producers."
"(PL) Madam President, we are including wine market regulations in a general regulation covering all markets, which had been adopted at an earlier date."
"Will this be better for wine producers?"
"Let us hope that it will represent a true simplification and reduction of the existing administrative burden imposed on farmers."
"The common agricultural policy health check adopted today is also intended to limit controls and reduce the administrative burden on farmers."
"The consolidation of regulations relating to very specific markets into a single regulation was also a debatable point, but has been agreed."
"It would be worth considering whether we really need to include in it the wine market, which is a highly specific market functioning according to an individual formula in terms of production, processing and traditions."
"(DE) Madam President, you have just switched off my microphone and therefore I am taking the opportunity of using the 'catch-the-eye' procedure to reformulate my questions."
"I wanted to ask the Commission specifically, who in future will be monitoring existing legislation when the common market organisation is amended and who will be making sure that nothing is pushed through in other areas, for example in the area of wine when we are talking about milk?"
"My second specific question is as follows: Can the Commission put in place the technical requirements to simplify management of the system, on the internet or in a portal, to allow users to access each market area separately, such as wine, milk, fruit and vegetables?"
"Those were my questions. Thank you, Madam President."
"Madam President, we are all well aware that the creation of the single Common Market Organisation is an attempt to improve transparency and to streamline and simplify legislation on the Common Agricultural Policy."
"Most sectors have already been successfully incorporated into the CMO."
"Like Mrs McGuinness, I do not come from a wine-growing area, so I will be very careful what I say - thank you Mrs Lulling."
"I support Mr Parish's view that the wine sector should now be included in the amendment, and while I understand the concerns expressed by some colleagues, I feel we should be aiming to complete this technical process, which will ultimately mean a reduction in red tape for farmers."
"That has got to be good."
"For wine-growing farmers, it will be a bonus at the end of the day."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank all the contributors to this debate."
"I would like to reiterate the importance of this proposal in the simplification of the CAP."
"The concerns you raised seem to be quite similar to those expressed at the very start of the single CMO project."
"But I think that experience has been quite reassuring."
"The single CMO is currently working really well."
"The CMO for wine was never simple, to be quite straightforward."
"On the contrary."
"What we are proposing is, in fact, bringing more clarity and credibility - to the extent, of course, it is possible - on the basis of a very complex existing text of the wine reform itself."
"No substance changes to the CMO wine reform will be done."
"We are talking about technical - and only technical - adjustments."
"There will be separate chapters."
"There will be issues unique to the wine sector which will be kept intact in the appropriate place of the single CMO, like those on production potential, support programmes, designations of origin, GI and traditional terms, labelling and presentation, oenological practices."
"But there will also be issues which are common to wine and other sectors, such as the provisions on trade with third countries or state aids, which will be combined into a single simple provision."
"I would also like to add that the possibility of using our search engines was mentioned."
"EUR-Lex has a search engine that allows extraction of all provisions from the single CMO that mention the word 'wine'."
"But, of course, from a technical point of view, it is not yet possible at this stage to provide for a consolidated electronic version of the whole wine CMO extracted from the consolidated single CMO."
"Of course, however, this should be possible when completed."
"I should also mention in the context of the questions of the honourable Members of Parliament that there is no possibility that wine issues would get mixed up in reforms with the other sectors."
"This is not a realistic prospect, simply, in practice."
"It is hard to see why a proposal on, for example, the dairy sector should somehow attract the attention of wine policymakers."
"In any event - from a purely legal point of view - integration into a single regulation does not change the situation."
"What would matter would be the substance of any changes proposed, not the precise legal framework in which they were proposed."
"To finish, I think we need to take the final step to complete the single CMO."
"I would therefore like to underline that the determination of the Commission to do so is very strong."
"But it is truly about simplification; it is truly about transparency; it is nothing more than that."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, as they say, so we look forward to the Commission actually delivering on what it is saying, because we will need this in an electronic form in the future so that we can access it."
"The Commission is promising that it will bring everything together in the one CMO, meaning that when we want to look into wine, we will be able to do so and will not be accessing the milk CMO at the same time, thereby reducing bureaucracy."
"We have had all these assurances tonight, and most of us will vote in favour tomorrow because we have had those assurances."
"As I said, we then look forward to checking what happens."
"We take the assurances of the Commission in the good faith in which they have been presented tonight, and look forward to working together on these CMOs - or rather on the one CMO - in the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 20 November 2008."
"Situation in the bee keeping sector (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission (B6-0480/2008) by Mr Parish, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the situation in the bee keeping sector."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Astrid Lulling very much because it is very much on her initiative that we are presenting this."
"As Chair, I will be presenting the report here tonight because we are extremely concerned about the situation regarding bees."
"What is happening to bees is very important to Europe - to the world, in fact."
"For the last two years running a third of honey bees in the USA have mysteriously died."
"In 2007, some 800 000 colonies were wiped out."
"In Croatia, five million bees disappeared in less than 48 hours."
"In the UK, one in five honey bee hives is falling and, around the world, commercial beekeepers are reporting losses of up to 90% since 2006."
"What is happening and just how serious is it for us and the future of mankind?"
"Albert Einstein predicted that man would only have four years of life left if the bees disappeared from the Earth, so we need to take this very seriously."
"If you look at honey bees, they are responsible for pollinating plants and flowers which provide about a third of all the food we eat."
"They are nature's top dog when it comes to pollination and without them we can say goodbye to soya beans, onions, carrots, broccoli, apples, oranges, avocados, peaches and many other foods."
"There would be no more strawberries."
"You can imagine how Wimbledon would not be able to survive without strawberries!"
"We would not have lucerne, which is used in cattle feed."
"We are therefore absolutely dependent on the honey bee."
"Of course, they also pollinate cotton so we would not have any clothes either."
"We really do have to take this matter very seriously."
"In China, for instance, there are virtually no honey bees in some regions and they are having to pollinate a lot of crops by hand."
"The 90 commercial crops grown worldwide which rely on pollination generate around GBP 30 billion a year."
"Bees contribute over GBP 100 million a year to the UK economy and around EUR 400 million to the European economy, so you can see quite clearly that there is a huge problem."
"Therefore I would ask the Commission - and if possible I want to be able to hand over some of my time to add to Astrid Lulling's because she was very much the driving force behind this - whether it can draw together more money for research."
"Having talked to the professional beekeepers and others, we know there is some mystery as to why bees are dying, partly because their condition has been very poor in the last few years and they seem to be dying literally like flies."
"Also there is a problem with having the right chemicals in place to cure the diseases of bees."
"I think as a Commission you need not only to make money available for research but also to draw together what all the Member States are doing."
"It is essential that we act now."
"We cannot wait until all the bees have died out because the problem will be incredibly serious."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you to Mr Parish and, of course, also to Mrs Lulling for this oral question and resolution on the EU beekeeping sector."
"The Commission clearly recognises the importance that bees play in the EU's ecology and its ecosystem."
"The Commission is also aware of the reports made in several Member States concerning significant losses in bee colonies."
"Let me go straight to your specific questions - there were quite some of them - and try to point out straightforwardly what the Commission is already doing in this sector."
"As regards bee mortality and research, in February this year the Commission requested that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) study the mortality in bees and its causes in the European Union."
"EFSA collected information from Member States and now intends to analyse it in order to provide the Commission with a clearer picture of the epidemiological situation of bee colony collapse, and this would provide the basis for further action in this area."
"Besides this EFSA action, the Commission is, and will be, supporting a number of research projects relating to honeybees in its Research Framework Programme."
"If you are interested I can mention some of them later on."
"Concerning ecological pollen zones, despite the fact that it seems difficult to set up zones as such, I would like to remind you that financial support is already granted for the efficiency of moving of beehives."
"This measure, which is provided for by Council Regulation No 1234/2007, is intended to assist the management of the movement of hives in the Community and provide locations where high concentrations of beekeepers can gather during the flowering season."
"This measure may also include enrichment of apicultural flora in certain areas."
"Concerning your third question, I would like to remind you that the placing on the market and authorisation of plant protection products is regulated by Council Directive 91/414/EEC."
"This Directive provides that pesticides may only be used if it has been demonstrated that they pose no significant risk of unacceptable effects to human and animal health, and the environment."
"Therefore, this assessment also covers the acute and long-term risks to honey bees and their larvae and the tests applied are based on standards developed by intergovernmental organisations such as, for example, the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation, in which 47 governments collaborate."
"It is important to note that the Community legislation is risk based."
"It is evident that insecticides are, by their nature, toxic to bees."
"However, their use may still be possible if exposure does not occur or is minimised to levels which do not generate harmful effects."
"Classic examples of such risk mitigation measures are: well adapted agronomic practices, appropriate rates and timing of the applications (for example in the evening after honeybee flight, or outside the flowering period of the crop and possibly other adjacent weeds), direct incorporation of the product in soil, uses in glasshouses inaccessible to bees or treatment of seeds in specialised facilities."
"As regards the quality of the surface waters, the Water Framework Directive has established protection of all waters; an obligation to achieve/maintain good water quality for all surface waters and groundwaters, by 2015; plus a prohibition of deterioration of water status; an obligation to establish a monitoring system; an obligation to develop the necessary plans and programmes by December 2009, in broad public consultation with local municipalities, stakeholders and non-governmental organisations."
"Concerning support to apiaries in difficulty, I would like to tell you that the Commission is glad to see that the number of hives increased between 2004 and 2007 - and this not counting enlargement."
"Regarding losses of bees, you should know that, since 2004, a new measure on restocking of hives has been added to the list of eligible measures in the national beekeeping programmes."
"Therefore, it is now possible to compensate for losses of bees (and production) by funding activities to promote queen production, purchasing of bee colonies, or even purchases of hives."
"I think that the question which you are raising is of course extremely serious and we have to take it with similar seriousness."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, when it is dangerous to delay, I can rely on the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its Chairman, my colleague Mr Parish."
"I thank them for their quick, effective response to my initiative of an oral question with debate and resolution to the European Commission to deal with the apiculture health crisis."
"In a situation in which bee colonies are becoming weaker and suffering excessive mortality, it is necessary to analyse all of the factors causing this increased bee mortality and to propose a plan of action to remedy this disastrous trend."
"The Commission has just read to us a long paper about what it has already done, but I have to say that, in recent years, whilst I have been rapporteur on the apiculture situation - since 1994 - it has needed a lot of persuading to act, whilst with my colleagues I have strived to draw its attention to this alarming situation, which is widely known and which has been perfectly described, especially by my colleague, Mr Parish."
"I do not have the time to repeat all that or to add anything but, as no one now dares deny that bee mortality is a deadly danger for our fruit and vegetable production, which is dependent on pollination, we demand that the Commission acts with greater persistence and more resources."
"It must contribute to an analysis of the causes of this bee mortality and finally include research into and the fight against apiculture disease in the European veterinary policy."
"It should promote the measures required to limit and remove the risk of an insufficient pollination and assure sufficient and diversified food production to meet human and livestock needs."
"It must be understood that apiculture's health crisis is as dangerous to human survival as the financial crisis is to the real economy."
"I will not quote the figures, except for one world figure: the value of pollination to the cultivation which feeds mankind is estimated at EUR 153 billion."
"The solutions we recommend are much less onerous than those mobilised for the financial crisis, and, even if we were finally to introduce the pollination bonus and financial assistance to beekeepers in difficulty to ensure the survival of bees in Europe, it would be peanuts in comparison with other budget lines."
"If you have a billion to send to Africa without any checks - as you wish to do - to fight hunger, with all the disastrous consequences that would entail, you should be able to find some EUR 60 million to do something worthwhile here."
"Madam President, as I have the office of rapporteur, may I still say something about the amendments?"
"I have not used up Mr Parish's speaking time..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I want to congratulate Mrs Lulling on the determination that she has shown in getting this issue, which some may feel is relatively minor, onto the agenda of this Parliament, albeit at such a late hour."
"Beekeeping is a farming activity with important economic repercussions and beneficial effects on rural development and the ecological balance."
"In my country, beekeeping involves around 27 000 producers who manage more than 2 300 000 hives."
"This makes my country the leading honey producer in the European Union."
"Spanish beekeepers, together with all other beekeepers, are facing problems deriving not only from the reduction in pollen and nectar, but also from the appearance of new diseases which are decimating hives."
"The Commission should be working on a line of research into the origin of these diseases and, in this respect, a budgetary effort seems vital to us."
"However, I want to add that imports - and I am referring to honey imports - must meet the same requirements as our products and offer full guarantees to consumers."
"In this respect, good labelling of our products is fundamental and the Commission has an important role to play in this."
"A high level must be maintained, in terms of both frequency and number of controls at border inspection points, to guarantee that no beekeeping products containing residues enter the European Union from third countries."
"For many of our farmers, beekeeping supplements their almost always limited income."
"It is also work which employs many women."
"Honey occupies an important place at small fairs and markets and beekeepers have made a major effort to diversify their products, provide labelling, ensure better hygiene and health guarantees, and open new channels of distribution."
"Commissioner, we cannot simply allow all these efforts to go to waste."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the beekeeping sector is not only a productive operation with age-old origins in the history of our agricultural activities, but currently it is one of the systems that is vital in maintaining the level of productivity of tree and herbaceous crops, thanks to cross-pollination."
"I would like to point out that 80% of plants grown produce fruit because of the pollen carried by bees, also ensuring genetic variation of species in reproduction."
"It is clear that, at the moment, the beekeeping sector and its operations cannot be replaced and are the only way of maintaining biodiversity on target."
"The products of the hives must increasingly frequently compete on the global market under competition conditions that lack transparency and through the mass importation of products, including those from outside the EU, which are not guaranteed."
"It is not always possible to guarantee their quality, partly because of pesticides which are banned in Europe but are used outside."
"For this reason, it is necessary to carry out labelling and to place the origin of the product on it."
"I also believe it is important to point to the serious consequences for beekeeping operations of the virus, as a result of which over 50% of the European beekeeping sector has been destroyed."
"I ask the European Commission to make further efforts in terms of scientific research to find a way of dealing with this serious disease, by banning any type of phytosanitary treatment during flowering periods."
"Madam President, Commissioner, natural wealth is decreasing before our very eyes."
"Whole species are dying out, decimated by parasites, disease, chemicals and the irresponsible behaviour of humanity."
"In many regions, ecological equilibrium has been disturbed and major, irreversible losses have occurred."
"We witness with concern the mass extinction of bees, with hives falling silent one after another, and many species of plants dependent on pollination perishing with them."
"The status of beekeeping determines the yields of as many as 84% of plant species cultivated in Europe."
"In this way, bees largely determine the abundance of food on our tables."
"Bees are being decimated by disease and pests with which beekeepers cannot cope alone."
"Additional funds are needed to control and study them."
"Nor can beekeepers cope alone with protecting their markets and ensuring the viability of their products."
"We therefore need to protect our internal market from the influx of poorer-quality third-country honey, frequently breaching public health requirements."
"Beekeepers must also receive aid in the form of subsidies or cheaper sugar as well as large-scale promotional campaigns."
"In summary, it is high time for us to start working like bees."
"As a beekeeper, I can only wish that the European Commission would pattern itself on the bee, so that we do not have to wait for fifteen years for a sensible programme which Mrs Lulling has been striving so hard to promote."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would also pay tribute to Mme Lulling, who has been tenacious to say the least in promoting and bringing this issue to the floor of the Parliament."
"Commissioner, I would also thank you for an impressive list of activities that the Commission is undertaking into this grave issue and, if anything, I think we are looking for a greater degree of funding and coordination as well."
"There is a risk that different bits of the institutions are doing a lot of good work but we do not necessarily tie it together."
"I think that is where this debate can shed some light."
"It is a serious issue."
"The miners of old took canaries down into the mines with them to warn of poisonous gases."
"They warned of poisonous gases by dying."
"That was bad news for the canaries but good news for the miners."
"Our concern is that the bees of Europe are doing essentially the same sort of service for us."
"A third of the EU's food - one in three mouthfuls of food - can be linked to bee pollination."
"There is a catastrophic decline in bees, and we must take action at European level."
"Scientists are agreed that there has been a decline."
"We have heard already how severe it has been, but we are less clear as to what has caused it."
"Is it the use of pesticides?"
"Is it climatic conditions?"
"Is it parasites and mites and other diseases, perhaps beyond our control?"
"Commissioner, I would also mention to you specifically the Bumblebee Conservation Trust at Stirling University in Scotland which has done groundbreaking work into this."
"Europe is not short of expertise."
"What we need to do is to tie it together."
"I think the text before us has a number of concrete actions which would take us in that direction - particularly apicultural set-aside, biodiversity zones, even alongside roads and unproductive land, research on pesticides, surface water and consideration of aid."
"As we have heard already, if we can find a billion euros to inflict on African development, I think we can find money to fund our own research."
"It is right that we see EU action on this and - dare I say - this does constitute a pretty coherent plan B, where plan A, the common European agricultural policy, has failed Europe's bees."
"I do think we need to see a greater complementarity of actions already on-going to alleviate that situation."
"(PL) Madam President, beekeepers and bees are experiencing tremendous problems and need help."
"We are witnessing a dramatic fall in the number of bee colonies, not only in Europe but throughout the world."
"Unfortunately, the profitability of the profession is falling and, with it, young people's interest in it."
"There are several issues which we need to address as soon as possible."
"First, we need to develop research into the parasites, diseases and viruses decimating these hard-working insects."
"Second, we need to introduce testing of honeys imported from third countries."
"All products must meet the appropriate quality requirements."
"In addition, labels should carry information about countries of origin."
"Third, we need to launch an information campaign explaining the beneficial influence of bees on the natural environment and of honey and other bee products on human health."
"Due to the scope of the problem, we need to consider providing financial support to apiaries threatened with extinction."
"The beekeeping community has been calling for cheaper sugar with which to feed the bees. It would be worth considering the introduction of a special support system for the beekeeping sector, in view of its highly beneficial impact on the natural environment."
"(PL) Madam President, may I congratulate Mrs Lulling and thank her for her indefatigable and passionate concern for the interests of the European beekeeping industry."
"It is a good thing that we are debating this problem, because beekeepers in Europe and throughout the world are alarmed and worried by the deaths of their bees."
"Investigations of the causes of this phenomenon are under way."
"Among the causes suggested by researchers is the possible impact of biotechnology and more specifically of the cultivation of genetically modified crops, which could have an adverse impact on the functioning of bees."
"I would therefore like to ask the European Commission, which approves the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the European Union, the following question."
"What are the relevant test results and what, in general, is the understanding of the impact of GMO on the condition of bees in Europe?"
"Madam President, let me first of all begin by congratulating Astrid for her work on this issue."
"As far as I am aware, she has been talking about bees now for quite a long time so I am glad to see that this resolution put forward by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has given Parliament a chance to debate the problem currently facing the beekeeping sector."
"While this issue has attracted a lot of attention and publicity, possibly because it is somewhat of a novelty item, we are well aware that in reality, the problems which we are facing are very serious and could potentially have devastating consequences."
"I am sure that I do not need to remind anyone of the importance of bees - and it has already been pointed out here tonight - not only for the production of important by-products such as wax and honey, but also for the role they play in pollination and the maintenance of healthy ecosystems."
"Coming as I do from the county of Armagh in Northern Ireland, which was well known within the island as the Orchard County, where bees are very necessary to pollinate the apples, and I can say that it is already telling a tale in that particular area."
"In this regard, the Commission urgently needs to step up its research on what exactly is causing such a sharp decline in the bee population and hopefully come forward with some solutions."
"The situation will only deteriorate if we cannot find a way to improve bee health and reduce bee mortality and stop the colonies of bees dying and disappearing."
"This is a source of great concern to all involved, not only within the whole of Europe, but even in the United States and beyond."
"I recently addressed a beekeepers' conference in my region of Northern Ireland and it reaffirmed to me, as I listened to the many contributions during that morning, the concern that the beekeepers have at the loss of their hives, especially during the winter period."
"We need extra funds to develop through further R&D in an attempt to assess what is the reason for this calamity hitting the beekeepers."
"If we are doing something wrong, we need to find it out urgently."
"Is it pesticides, or some other reason?"
"There may be lots of theories and such speculation, but the truth is we do not have the answer, and we need that and to be given the extra support."
"Madam President, we know the importance of bees."
"Everyone has spoken about it."
"However, one of the issues that has not been addressed in the debate is the reality of a substantial trade in commercial bumblebees."
"There is literally free movement of bees globally and, as far as I know, there is very little regulation of the movement of bees when there needs to be."
"We do it in other live categories and in livestock, and we know that it works in terms of disease control."
"The movement of bees has the potential to import the varroa mite, as has happened in Ireland."
"There is now the problem of the small hive beetle, which is causing havoc for bee-keepers."
"So we have a huge problem, to which we do not know the answer."
"There are at least half a dozen reasons why these things may be happening, and research is absolutely necessary."
"We need to coordinate that research across the European Union so that we find answers."
"We also need to address the issue of beekeepers themselves, because it seems they are an ageing population, and we need more of them, not less."
"Madam President, if Mrs Lulling will stay quite long enough for me to congratulate her, I will be delighted to do so on her consistent interest and support for apiculture in the European Parliament for some time now."
"The decline in bee populations and the frightening implications for plant pollination and biodiversity generally deserve our full attention and we must support research and join with scientists worldwide to try and find the causes."
"Parasitic infections, climate change, pesticides: we can only speculate at this stage."
"Twenty five per cent of our food depends directly on bees, apart altogether from their contribution to maintaining our grasslands."
"Regrettably, in Ireland, our only research centre in this area, in Clonroche in County Wexford, was closed down by the Irish government some years ago."
"Therefore, I am not sure that Ireland can contribute; we have the scientists and the knowledge, but we certainly do not have the support from the government."
"I look forward to hearing from the Commission on how Europe and the European Union can support the research and what we are doing to date in this area."
"- (FR) Madam President, as Mr Parish has had to leave, he has asked me to state our position on the amendments which reached us at the last minute."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has unanimously adopted the resolution, with all its amendments, which I considered in their entirety."
"However, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, which did not offer any sparkling contributions when the resolution was being discussed, is now making a last-minute attempt to restore its reputation by proposing four amendments."
"The latter not only provide no new material, but would also confuse the text, which is currently coherent and legible."
"Amendment 1 stems from an error in the German translation, since what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf is proposing is exactly what I proposed but, as I said, the German translation of my recital is inadequate."
"Amendment 2 is stating the obvious, Amendment 3 is unintelligible, and Amendment 4 duplicates paragraph 8, which clearly calls for intensified research into the effects of pesticides on bee mortality, and furthermore states that authorisation for such products should be made dependent on this research, as is already the case."
"I therefore suggest that these amendments be rejected, because they add nothing, and they would spoil a text that is clear and properly worded."
"I insist on a good draft, because this resolution is very important, and we want it to be worded properly."
"This is why we wish to reject these amendments."
"(PL) Madam President, the beekeeping debate in the European Parliament has attracted considerable interest from beekeepers."
"As a beekeeper, I have personally met in Puławy with beekeepers who had travelled from all over Poland."
"The asked me to put just one question to the European Commission, and to obtain a definitive answer - what can beekeepers actually count on in the coming years??"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I truly believe that this was a very fruitful discussion with many ideas not only for my colleague but for the DG AGRI services, as well as for my services and others."
"Many of the Directorates General other than DG AGRI are working on the issue we are discussing today: DG SANCO, DG Research and DG Environment."
"It is really a multidisciplinary issue."
"When we talk about how much funding is actually committed to this, I think that we will have to look at various other areas as well."
"Let me come first to many of your questions concerning what we are doing, what is in the pipeline and what we actually mean when we talk about research in the bee sector."
"In the Sixth Framework Programme, a specific target research project on food quality and safety priority was named 'Bees in Europe and Sustainable Honey Production' (BEE SHOP)."
"This gathers together nine European honey bee research groups specialising in honey quality, pathology, genetics and behaviour."
"Do not be misled: FP6 projects are the ones that are already running;"
"In addition, the specific support action 'Bee Research and Virology in Europe' (BRAVE) has enabled the organisation of two large multidisciplinary conferences, involving experts working in fundamental and applied research on bees - experts on virology, diagnosis, immunology and epidemiology - as well as international trade, policy formulation and disease risk assessment."
"A call for proposals was published on 3 September this year, on the theme of food agriculture and fisheries biotechnology, on the identification of emerging honey bee pests and diseases, and the re-emergence of pathogens, aimed at elucidating the intimate mechanisms and reasons for the increased honey bee mortality."
"So it is exactly linked to this topic and many of your questions."
"The environmental aspects, including chronic exposure to pesticides, will also be taken into account."
"The integrated project ALARM, on assessing large-scale environmental risks for biodiversity, is also funded under the Sixth Framework Programme and includes a module on pollinator loss."
"ALARM will develop and test methods and protocols for the assessment of large-scale environmental risks in order to minimise negative direct and indirect human impacts."
"Research will focus on assessment and focus of changes in biodiversity structure, function, dynamism of ecosystems - in particular risk arising from climate change, environmental chemicals, biological invasions and pollinator loss in the context of current and future European land-use betterance will also be assessed."
"These are all current initiatives."
"One thing which I would like to underline - since this was also stressed by your colleague - is that Europe is not short of expertise."
"I think we have to be aware of this and also be fair."
"At European Union level, we deal with 5% - I repeat, 5% - of European Union public money which is devoted to research."
"So it is of the utmost important that we join forces and do as much as possible practically."
"The creation of the European research area, which I fully support, is actually exactly this idea - that we all know what we are doing and that we join the scientific expertise which we already have across Europe."
"This is certainly a missing element in Europe today."
"I will ensure that the Commissioner responsible for research hears your calls for further research - that is me, but today I am in a different role."
"One thing which I would also like to mention - because it was perhaps not fully understood in my introduction - is the EFSA full assessment on bee mortality and bee surveillance in Europe."
"This was published on 11 August 2008, so it is a new thing."
"It is exactly the analysis of the programme which you are searching for and I think it is important that we all look at what we have before us."
"I must also answer the colleague who asked about GMO crops."
"The only GMO crop currently cultivated in the European Union is Bt-maize MON 810."
"Bt-maize, and Bt-toxin in general, have been extensively analysed with regard to the possible impact on bee health."
"Forced feeding trials, where healthy bees are exposed to high doses of bt-toxin, have not shown any negative effect."
"Overall, the overwhelming majority of studies show that this bt-maize pollen diet has no impact on bees."
"I can add to this that the recently observed massive losses of bees, termed 'colony collapse disorder' (CCV), in North America and also in Europe do not appear to be related to the use of GMO crops as they are also reported from other areas where no GMO crops are grown."
"For example, bee losses observed in southern Germany have been clearly attributed to poisoning by the pesticide Poncho Pro."
"It also has a Latin name, which is so difficult that I would rather not read it out."
"In conclusion, Commission actions will certainly continue and be strengthened."
"They will help beekeepers to face the current difficulties and encourage them to continue their activity."
"I also hope that will encourage new entrants to the profession since this activity plays an extremely important role, not only for our EU biodiversity, but also economically."
"As regards my colleague Commissioner Fischer Boel's direct responsibilities, she will continue to make sure that the national beekeeping programmes are used in the most efficient way."
"However, in the first instance, it is up to the Member States to spend their budgets in an appropriate way."
"Today we have EUR 26.3 million in European money each year."
"This is doubled by adding the money from the Member States - but we are not spending it."
"We are spending 80% of that money."
"Member States are not spending what is currently at their disposal."
"Finally, the best solution to guarantee a future for the sector is to encourage consumption of EU honey."
"Since 2004, honey has been added to the list of eligible products for promotion on the internal market and several programmes have been accepted."
"My answer was longer because I just wanted to make it clear to you that we are taking these actions seriously and that you should count on us - definitely also in my area - to continue to do so. Thank you for your attention and for staying so long."
"I have received one motion for a resolution from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 20 November 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Bees are important to many different cultures in many different parts of the world."
"Their universality has not come about by accident."
"Beekeeping has been an important component of the economy since prehistoric times, that is to say since before the inception of written history."
"In Spain, honey was gathered 6 000 years ago."
"Today, the efforts of the bees and the beekeepers could go to waste due to the phenomena affecting the natural environment and also, indirectly, humanity."
"In Europe, we still have people whose livelihood depends on their work and that of their bees."
"They sell the honey they have themselves produced."
"We should be happy that this is so."
"Return to traditional forest beekeeping has also been attempted."
"In Poland, these attempts were supported by beekeepers who had come from Bashkiria, because no one in our country remembered the ancient methods any more."
"Beekeeping is of cultural, social and economic importance."
"This is why we should protect European beekeeping."
"Sadly, there is a lot to protect it against."
"Economic threats, such as unfair competition by third countries, and threats to bee health, as well as biological threats such as diseases, parasites, environmental pollution and the unconsidered use of pesticides."
"The European Commission and Member States should support the beekeeping sector, which is facing major challenges."
"Beekeepers by themselves may find it hard to save biodiversity, to whose riches bees contribute so much."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will excuse the fact that I am a few minutes late."
"Our former fellow Member Otto von Habsburg is celebrating his 96th birthday today."
"He was a Member of the European Parliament from 1979 to 1999."
"His attendance record and the quality of his work was an example to us all."
"I have just spoken to him on the telephone, which is why I am a couple of minutes late, and have congratulated him warmly on behalf of all you - I hope I am allowed to do this - and, of course, on behalf of his political friends from Bavaria on reaching his 96th birthday."

"Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2007"
"The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' Annual Report for 2007."
"President of the European Court of Auditors. - Mr President, it is an honour for me to be able to take part in your debate on the Court of Auditors' annual report on the 2007 financial year, which I have already presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 10 November."
"Overall, the Court's audit opinion on the accounts is now unqualified - positive, if you wish - but the opinion on underlying transactions is broadly similar to that of last year."
"On the accounts, the Court concludes that they give a fair presentation, in all material respects, of the financial position of the European Communities and cash flows at the year end."
"Owing to the improvements that have taken place, the qualifications expressed last year are no longer necessary."
"As regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, the Court gives unqualified opinions for revenue, commitments and payments for 'economic and financial affairs' and 'administrative and other expenditure'."
"As regards 'administrative and other expenditure', which accounts for EUR 8 billion in 2007, the Court acknowledges the decisions and actions taken by the institutions to further improve financial management based on the recommendations made by the Court, including those taken by the European Parliament."
"The Court will assess their impact in future years."
"However, for 'agriculture and natural resources', 'cohesion', 'research, energy and transport', 'external aid, development and enlargement', and 'education and citizenship' the Court concludes that payments are still materially affected by errors, although to different degrees."
"Supervisory and control systems covering these areas are judged to be at best only partially effective, although in 'research' and, at the level of the Commission, for 'external aid, development and enlargement', the Court notes certain improvements in the supervisory and control systems."
"For 'cohesion' which accounted for EUR 42 billion of budgetary expenditure, the Court estimates, based on the audit of a representative sample of transactions, that at least 11% of the costs claimed should not have been reimbursed."
"The most common reasons for errors were ineligible costs, over-declarations of money spent and serious failures to respect procurement rules."
"For 'agriculture and natural resources', where EUR 51 billion was spent in 2007, the Court found that 'rural development' continues to account for a disproportionately large part of the overall error, while the error rate for EAGF expenditure is estimated to be slightly below the materiality threshold."
"But why is this situation persisting, and why are the underlying transactions in a situation broadly similar to that of last year?"
"Well, material levels of errors persist because there is a high level of inherent risk associated with many areas of European Union spending and weaknesses related to supervision and control."
"Much of the budget, including in the areas under shared management, is disbursed to millions of beneficiaries across the Union, often under complex rules and regulations, based on the self-declarations of those who receive the funds."
"These inherently risky circumstances lead to errors by them and also by those paying the funds."
"To control these risks, there are several levels of supervision and control: first, at the level of beneficiaries; second, to ensure that the arrangements to check claims are designed and operating effectively, and, finally, supervision by the Commission to ensure that all the systems are working as a whole."
"As most errors occur at the level of the final beneficiaries, they can often only be detected reliably by detailed controls carried out on the spot."
"Such checking is costly, and so, usually, only a small proportion of individual claims are covered."
"Again, the Court's audit work on the 2007 financial year found that Member States are not always effective in identifying the shortcomings in the arrangements for checking individual claims."
"The Court also found some weaknesses in the Commission's conformity clearance in agriculture."
"In many areas of the budget, mechanisms exist for recovering incorrectly made payments from beneficiaries or, where Member States have incorrectly administered expenditure schemes, 'disallowing' some expenditure, i.e. refusing to finance it from the budget."
"However, there is not yet reliable information on the impact of corrective actions, and the Court concluded that corrective actions cannot yet be considered effective in mitigating errors."
"All of this said, it is fair to acknowledge that the Commission has made significant efforts since 2000 to address the weaknesses in supervision and control, mainly through developing and implementing an internal reform programme and, in 2006, launching an action plan to improve the supervisory and control systems across the Union."
"Annual activity reports and declarations, a key part of the reform programme, including those relating to cohesion and agriculture, now present a picture that is more in line with the Court's own assessments, but some reservations still appear to underestimate the problems."
"Concerning its 2006 action plan, in spite of progress noted by the Commission, the Court finds that it is still too early for their impact on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions to be felt."
"For example, 2007 was only the first year for which Member States were required to produce an annual summary of available audits and declarations."
"These can, in time, as outlined in the Court's Opinion 6/2007, stimulate improved management and control of European Union funds."
"But they do not yet provide a reliable assessment of the functioning and effectiveness of the systems."
"This is the current situation."
"But, looking forward, we need to ask what more should be done, and which measures for the future should be considered."
"The Court suggests that any such measures need to take the following considerations into account."
"First, the benefits from efforts to reduce errors need to be weighed against the costs."
"Second, all participants in the budget process need to recognise that some risk of error is unavoidable."
"Third, the appropriate level of risk for the different individual areas of the budget needs to be agreed on at the political level by the budget/discharge authorities in the name of the citizens."
"Fourth, schemes that cannot be satisfactorily implemented at an acceptable level of cost and with tolerable risk should be reconsidered."
"Finally, due consideration needs to be given to simplification, not least in areas such as rural development and research, because well-designed rules and regulations that are clear to interpret and simple to apply decrease the risk of error and enable streamlined, cost-effect management and control arrangements."
"The Court, therefore, encourages the Commission to conclude its analysis on the cost of controls, and on the levels of risk inherent in the different spending areas."
"The Court also recommends the Commission continue in its efforts to improve its monitoring and reporting, including working with Member States so that effective use of the annual summaries can be made in the annual activity reports, and allowing its follow-up of actions to improve recovery systems."
"In addition to simplification and making use of the concept of tolerable risk, in its response to the Commission communication 'Reforming the Budget, Changing Europe', the Court suggests applying the principles of clarity of objectives, realism, transparency and accountability when designing arrangements for European Union spending."
"The Court also encourages the political authorities to explore the scope for recasting expenditure programmes in term of outputs and to critically consider the appropriate level of national, regional and local discretion in managing them."
"To conclude, while acknowledging that progress is being made, the Court underlines that further improvements in the financial management of the European Union will depend on the success of ongoing and future measures to reduce risks to an acceptable level and develop cost-effective systems to manage them."
"In times of financial turbulence and economic instability, the role of the Court is even more important and relevant."
"As the external auditor of the European Union, it is our obligation to act as the independent guardian of the financial interests of the citizens of the Union."
"In presenting this report, it is our objective to contribute towards transparency and promote accountability, both of which are considered essential to securing the trust of European Union citizens in its institutions that keep the Union functioning and give it the direction for the future."
"President Silva Caldeira, I would like to thank you for your report and for the always very constructive cooperation between you, and the Court, and the European Parliament."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Court's annual report."
"I would like to underline the very constructive cooperation we have enjoyed with the Court."
"There is one piece of really good news in the report: the Court has given the accounts a completely clean bill of health, what the auditors call an 'unqualified opinion'."
"This is a remarkable achievement in only the third year of the new accounting system."
"There is a second piece of very good news: the Court acknowledges that we are strengthening our supervisory systems."
"In 2007, for the first time, there is not a single chapter with a red card on control systems from the external auditor."
"Many efforts are ongoing in this field."
"I would like to highlight the annual summaries of existing audits in Structural Funds submitted by Member States for the first time last spring."
"The Court recognises these efforts, even if results are not yet translated into significantly reduced error rates on the ground."
"The Commission is encouraged by this."
"It is a fact that on individual transactions the picture remains mixed."
"For the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, the largest volume of agricultural expenditure, the Court recognises that this year again the error rate is below materiality level."
"The same is not true for the rest of the chapter on natural resources, where rural development is prone to a high level of errors."
"For cohesion funds too, the Court still finds far too many errors."
"The Commission is giving the highest priority to reducing these error rates, and it is not shying away from taking a tough stance if needed."
"In 2008 we have already imposed financial corrections on the ERDF and ESF - the cohesion funds - for EUR 843 million and an estimated EUR 1.5 billion more is in the pipeline."
"Allow me to recall that, as far as errors in the underlying payments are concerned, the bar is set very high."
"At least 98% must be error-free."
"Nevertheless, we are getting closer: the auditors now say that for all budget areas but one as much as 95% or more of the payments are free from serious financial error."
"For external aid and internal policies, such as transport and energy, as well as education and citizenship, the Court does note improvements."
"Administration and economic and financial affairs fare even better."
"These areas are in direct management by the Commission, which may partly explain why efforts undertaken have a more immediate impact."
"So, to summarise: in the Commission's view the Court of Auditors' annual report for 2007 shows that there is steady, gradual progress."
"We have come a long way over the last five years."
"Looking at the progress made, I can assert that the Commission has absolutely no regrets about having set itself the objective of achieving a positive declaration of assurance concerning the underlying transactions."
"We hope that the European Parliament will recognise the positive developments and continue to support efforts for simplification, better management, and more accountability from the Member States."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, my first words are to thank you, Mr President of the Court, for the immense task you have accomplished with the Court's auditors;"
"I think this is an important document for our information."
"As we know, this discharge is the first discharge for the financial perspective 2007-2013."
"It is the first with the new management, certification and audit control system introduced by the Commission."
"Finally, it is the last for the period of office coming to a close, because we are starting six months of work and we shall be voting in April before the European elections, at a time when the Commission has promised us a positive statement of assurance."
"It is now 14 years since we have had a positive statement of assurance, which gives the European Parliament cause for concern."
"First, as regards the accounts, I am told that this is an unqualified opinion."
"Why was Galileo not consolidated?"
"And I cannot hide the fact that I shall never get used to accounts with negative equity of 58 billion. That is one of my concerns."
"So this is good news."
"We must be glad that, for administrative expenditure, we have a positive opinion, with low error rates and, from what we have been told, no fraud."
"However, the Member States have poor shared management in agriculture, cohesion and the Structural Funds, where there are too many errors - over 60% sometimes in some Member States."
"The Council is not here and it would be interesting to know what the Member States and the Council think about this situation, when they do not sign the national declarations and given that, with the present difficulties in public finances, the citizens will be demanding."
"I think the President is right and we should consider this procedure of discharge with the committees, the Commission, the Council, Parliament, the national parliaments and the national courts of auditors, which are very conspicuous by their absence from this debate."
"I should like, with your permission Mr President, to take thirty seconds' speaking time as rapporteur to express my astonishment, as my fellow Members have done, at the fact that the Council is absent."
"However, I have understood, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, that you are to present your report to the Ecofin Council in a few days' time and that, as a result, the Council cannot express an opinion before there has been an exchange of views between the various Member States."
"This being so and as the finger is being pointed at the Member States on shared management, I trust we shall receive the Council's opinion quickly and I shall take the liberty, Mr President of the European Parliament, of requesting a written question at question time asking for a prompt opinion from the Council, once it has been able to have an exchange of views on this excellent report by the European Court of Auditors."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would very much like to congratulate the Court of Auditors for the work which it is submitting to Parliament in the form of the Annual Report for 2007."
"In a series of constantly improving annual reports, in my opinion this is the best report that the Court of Auditors has so far presented."
"It is more informative, more colourful, so to speak, and clearer."
"Members of the Court of Auditors, I have noted with satisfaction that you have resisted the temptation to add a touch of populism to this year's report."
"On the basis of a number of different special reports and, in particular, this report, we will now have to evaluate whether the work done by the Commission in 2007 using European taxpayer's money was satisfactory or not."
"So far there have been a number of encouraging presentations, in particular from the Commissioner for the Cohesion Fund."
"The Commissioner for Research has also indicated that the criticism from this House and from the Court of Auditors in last year's report has fallen on fertile ground."
"One area where things are still not working well is the cooperative effort to control the European budget which Member States are withdrawing from."
"Four Member States - Denmark, the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden - are giving an encouraging example of active cooperation."
"It is satisfying to see that a national court of auditors, such as that in Germany, is beginning to concern itself at a national level with the European money being spent in Germany and we hope that there will be a political debate on this subject."
"Since the Wynn and Mulder reports we have been attempting to bridge the gap in the treaty between Article 274 and Article 5 by means of this requirement for national statements of assurance."
"While we are discussing this subject, Commissioner Kallas, I would be happy for the Commission to take a more helpful and active role in standardising these reports."
"This is something which your positive approach should help to bring about one of these days."
"When we pass judgment on the quality of the Commission's work in our discharge, we will inform the taxpayers whether or not it is acceptable in overall terms."
"If we expect professionalism from other institutions, we must also take a more professional approach ourselves."
"I believe that it is both intolerable and ludicrous to hold debates in this House about whether this committee can continue to be a so-called neutral committee or not."
"It is not acceptable for a control committee to be regarded simply as a sort of add-on committee, because that is not professional."
"The times have long gone when the budget came under consideration in one place for six months or so and then for the rest of the year another committee was responsible for budget control."
"We have not even looked at all the agencies yet and we are supposed to assure our taxpayers that everything is functioning correctly."
"We need professionalism from the other institutions, but we as a Parliament must also make an effort, otherwise we will not be able to stand up in front of the taxpayers."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to thank the Court of Auditors for the report, and I too have noticed an improvement every year, in that the report is more legible and set out in a more readily understood format, amongst other things."
"Indeed, there is an improvement every year, albeit only a slight one."
"We can now to some extent take the wind out of the sails of the euro sceptics by saying that the accounts have been approved for the first time."
"If we look more closely at the improvements in the accounts, though, they are only minor."
"We have managed to get through by the narrowest of margins."
"If we read what was written in 2006 and 2007, then there is not that much difference, really, although there is an improvement."
"The Commission underlines that, over the years, budget implementation has improved considerably."
"It claims that, in 2002 and 2003, only 4% of expenditure was approved, compared to over 45% at the moment."
"This is, indeed, a considerable improvement, mainly due, I fear, to the drastic changes in agricultural policy."
"Had agricultural policy continued as before, I doubt very much that we would have achieved an approval margin of over 40%."
"This is a matter of great concern, because the Commission's core techniques do not yet meet international standards and still require major improvements."
"Progress over the past four years has been too slow to my mind."
"It is regrettable that we cannot yet measure the results of the action plan."
"Initially, the Commission put a great deal of effort into it."
"It was an excellent method, as we have all acknowledged, but sadly we have not seen enough results."
"I share Mr Bösch's disappointment at what the Commission has done with the national declarations."
"This is all the more surprising because, last year, the Commission stated quite clearly that it was not going to implement the agreement."
"Luckily, the Commission retraced its footsteps."
"We cannot forget, though, that this is an agreement that has been signed by the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"After all, it is unacceptable for one of the parties to state its disinclination to implement the agreement."
"I cannot wait to hear the guidelines the Commission has issued to implement the agreement."
"What are the results so far of the discussions with the Member States to carry out Article 44?"
"We will need to put much of our time and energy into this in the coming months."
"That is also when we will need to decide whether we want to grant discharge to the Commission in April, or whether we will postpone it by six months."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I, too, should like to thank the Court of Auditors, and not least their staff."
"They have once again done a sterling job."
"I should like to remind the Commissioner that it is true that, at the start of your mandate as Anti-Fraud Commissioner, you promised and pledged to produce, by the end of your mandate, a statement that confirms reliability of the accounts, as well as the regularity and lawfulness of all accounts."
"Have we achieved this yet?"
"Clearly not."
"For the 14th time in a row, this statement has not materialised."
"Are we heading in the right direction?"
"Without a doubt, or so says the Court of Auditors, and you are there to defend this stance with tooth and nail."
"Should we be worried?"
"I think so."
"You have exactly one year left, though, to make good on your promise, your pledge, and there is a great deal to be done yet, as my fellow Members said themselves."
"What has the Court of Auditors noticed?"
"There are flaws in the bookkeeping system, partly attributable to the complex legal and financial framework."
"According to the Court of Auditors, there is a risk when it comes to quality and financial information."
"What does the Court of Auditors say about the regularity and lawfulness of payments?"
"Does it sanction the administrative expenses?"
"There are major problems in large sections of the budget, including agriculture, the Cohesion Fund, the structural funds, the Regional Fund, social policy, rural development, research and development, energy, transport, external support, development and expansion, education and citizenship."
"A representative sample has been made of everything related to cohesion, namely the Cohesion Fund itself and the structural funds."
"We note that, in its report, the Court of Auditors states that in 11% of the cases payments should never have been made."
"This is a very serious finding, and something to which much attention will need to be devoted in the discharge."
"2007 was the first year - as various fellow Members pointed out - in which the Member States were asked to draft an annual summary of the available inspections and statements, but, according to the Court of Auditors, it does not work."
"The summaries cannot be compared and they do not contain all the information we need."
"Despite this, as Mr Mulder pointed out with good reason, there was a pledge, a political agreement."
"This is something we worked hard for in Parliament."
"What do we see now?"
"A whole host of Member States are reluctant to lend their cooperation."
"It is notably the eurosceptic countries that are pulling their weight: the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands to a great extent."
"Surely this cannot be?"
"We should indeed remind the Council of its responsibility in this."
"Finally, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to underline the political requirement with regard to the Member States, namely that they should indeed face up to their political responsibility for the spending they help manage."
"This is their darned duty!"
"In addition, we would also like to see more transparency about the end beneficiaries."
"There may be an attractive website, but I have noticed that a number of Member States, including my own country Belgium, place information on it which is woefully inadequate and wholly intransparent."
"There is work to be done in that area too, therefore, and we will need to fight for this during the discharge."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, President of the European Court of Auditors, Vice-President of the Commission Siim Kallas has, generally speaking, done good work to improve budgetary control, and especially to increase administrative transparency."
"Public awareness of agricultural subsidies is a good example of that."
"The European Court of Auditors partly agrees."
"There are of course areas for comment, particularly on the use of agricultural and regional development aid."
"Responsibility for these lies mainly with the Member States."
"Something of a split might be discerned in the Court of Auditors' report: the slightly more correct northern net contributors as opposed to the southern beneficiaries that are rather more prone to abuse."
"The split is also obviously affected by the volumes of cash involved."
"In the south there is more to distribute and control than in the north."
"To ensure that the wrong generalisations are not made, it is important that the Court of Auditors shows precisely in its reports where any abuse has occurred so that confusion and the wrong generalisations are avoided as a result."
"I would like to focus attention on something to which the competence of the European Court of Auditors does not extend and which is also a grey area from a national standpoint."
"This is the Athena Fund set up in 2004, which falls within the competence of the Member States, though not the EU."
"The Member States pay into the Fund out of their own defence budgets for combined military operations that fall outside the scope of EC competence."
"These operations work, on the one hand, on the NATO principle of 'costs lie where they fall'."
"On the other hand, there is this Athena scheme, whose financing is secret."
"This sort of military operation on the part of EU countries should be brought under democratic control."
"When the report by the European Court of Auditors is being considered, our group will be paying special attention to the legality of the Council's budget, which for Parliament has up till now been a grey area."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, well, Commissioner Kallas seems to have read a completely different document."
"I can assure him that as a UK PLC this simply would not do at all."
"If any UK PLC had filed accounts of this nature for 14 years which have been completely unacceptable, and again this year - and I do not regard the Court of Auditors as having given this a clean bill of health at all, and I have read the document - if the Commission were a board of UK PLC directors I have to say they would now be in prison!"
"We have a situation here where this Parliament, if Parliament it is, which spends most of the year talking about bendy bananas, knobbly parsnips, standardisation of bottle sizes, and on Tuesday we were even voting on the standardisation of tractor seats, so this absurd organisation spends most of its year doing nothing very much of value."
"We only have one serious responsibility, and that is to hold the Commission to account on the budget."
"That is the most serious thing we can do; and it is going to go through again for the 15th year on the nod."
"It is an utter disgrace, and let the British MEPs know I am watching very carefully how they vote."
"I will make sure that it is known back in the UK what they do out here as opposed to what they actually say when they go home."
"Mr President, we all know that the European Commission's accounts can never be signed off until - and unless - two major underlying problems are finally resolved."
"Neither of these problems is new."
"Firstly, there is no certainty about the opening balances for the accounting system, which was changed in 2005, because a year later there were huge readjustments which made it obvious that no reconciliation was, or is, possible."
"Secondly, there is the problem of shared management, which has already been referred to, or in other words the distribution of public funds to recipients who are then held responsible for both using and accounting for them."
"Even the internal auditors in Member States admit that that system is impossible to operate."
"For years, all we have ever heard - and we heard it again today from the Court and from the Commissioner - is well-intentioned talk about improvement soon, managing risk, error rates - trivia!"
"The reality is that nothing substantial changes, and the public is losing patience, and rightly so."
"Tinkering with the deckchairs on this particular Titanic does nothing to plug the holes in the bottom."
"If the Greek figures are to be believed, we still have olive groves in the Aegean Sea."
"The misuse of funds in Bulgaria is reported to be out of control."
"In Turkish-held Northern Cyprus, EUR 259 million of public money has been handed over for economic development, but the EU office in Nicosia openly admits it cannot monitor or control it, simply because we do not recognise the Turkish regime."
"Some of that money has just paid for new pavements in the booming holiday resort of Kyrenia, where the casinos do a roaring trade day and night."
"The local regime chooses not to raise sufficient taxes and takes the view that if the EU is stupid enough to pay for them, then that is fine by them."
"Yet that money could have been put to good use."
"Not only are the accounts unacceptable, but some of the judgements on how public money is used are unacceptable too."
"(SV) I would like to start by thanking the Court of Auditors for a constructive report that is unusually easy to follow."
"It will, I am sure, form a sound basis for our ongoing work in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I thought I would restrict myself mainly to the EU's independent authorities, as I am actually rapporteur for them."
"Some institutions are, of course, growing in terms of numbers, responsibility and how much money they have at their disposal."
"I would therefore like to suggest that examination of these institutions is also becoming increasingly important."
"Every year that I have been here in the European Parliament we have commented on the problems the independent authorities have with regard to planning, implementing the budget, public procurement, reporting and so on, and, unfortunately, it looks like we will have to do the same thing again this year."
"The same is true with regard to the problem of their requesting more and more money, despite them having trouble spending it during previous years."
"I think that this raises a number of important questions, as it seems to be a recurring problem."
"At least for me, it raises questions about responsibility and control."
"I therefore think that it is particularly unfortunate that the Council is not here to participate in the debate, as I think that we have a joint responsibility to ensure that these decentralised authorities are controlled and monitored."
"In addition to these general comments, which are for the most part applicable to a considerable number, although not all, of the decentralised authorities, there are four authorities that I think we have grounds for examining more closely this year."
"The first is the European Police College, CEPOL, which has again this year received remarks for its public procurement, and this is a recurring problem that has not been addressed."
"Furthermore, it is even more remarkable that the Court of Auditors has pointed out that money has been used to pay private expenses."
"Another one is Galileo, in connection with which the Court of Auditors has not yet been able to issue a statement about whether or not they want to give a simple statement of assurance, simply because there is so much uncertainty surrounding the relationship between Galileo and the European Space Agency and the other players involved."
"Where does Galileo begin and end?"
"Last but not least are Frontex and the European Railway Agency, both of which are clear examples of authorities which overestimate their costs and demand too much money, but nevertheless request more money every year."
"These are matters that I intend to look more closely at during the discharge process."
"I hope to continue the constructive cooperation with both the Court of Auditors and the Commission and I am disappointed that the Council is not here to contribute to this discussion."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Caldeira spoke of risk as of an important error factor in the preparation of this report."
"May I take a moment to focus on European Development Fund issues."
"The fund provides aid to countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific."
"Their risk differs from that of Member States, and is also greater than in the Member States."
"It is important that the Court has concluded that the transactions underlying the income and commitments for the budget year are lawful and correct."
"This general conclusion gives us grounds to view the report as a whole with approval."
"On the other hand, the number of errors in the transactions underlying the payments is high."
"The Court has questioned the Commission's dynamic interpretation of eligibility criteria, and the Court's view that the interpretation is flawed must be accepted."
"The point is that it does not enable Member States to meet standards of reliable public fund management."
"The Commission should review its position at the earliest possible opportunity."
"Parliament has in fact already approached it on this matter."
"Another issue raised by the report is cooperation with the UN. It highlights the UN's unwillingness or negligence in forwarding the relevant payment documents."
"The Court indicated three main areas of significant error."
"They include eligibility of expenses, pre-financing settlement and the payment of incorrect amounts."
"These errors should and could have been identified and corrected much earlier by the personnel who approved the payments."
"For this reason, the Commission's explanation that auditing costs are very high, as indicated by the ratio of the costs to the effectiveness of the audits is unconvincing."
"It is hard to agree with this point of view."
"Instead, the Commission should aim for greater efficiency and increase the number of its employees."
"Indeed, we, as Parliament, approached it on this matter a year ago."
"In summary, this section of the information provided by the Court of Auditors is mixed."
"While recognising its overall correctness, I wish to point to areas of significant error."
"The report includes the Court's recommendations, which must largely be accepted."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to take my turn in thanking the Court of Auditors for its excellent work."
"There have been a number of Members who, at this very moment, have rebelled against the general use of European funds."
"I would like to say that I hope that, when they report our debates and the results of the work of the Court of Auditors, the media will not do what they usually do and talk about the trains which arrived late and say nothing about the trains which arrived on time, because most of the budget of the European Union has been spent advisedly."
"We must not confuse the wood with the trees."
"Having said which, we have noted that the trend in this report by the Court of Auditors has been one of improvement."
"That is very good news."
"You also said that there are millions of beneficiaries, which alone illustrates the difficulty and scope of the task."
"For my part, I wish to underline two responsibilities."
"I do not wish to point the finger of accusation at any specific organisation."
"I simply wish to say that if, in future, we want to do better, those with material responsibility in the matter need to act."
"As I see it, there are two categories of people responsible."
"There is the Commission - and the Court of Auditors has just told us, having said that there are several million beneficiaries, that the first thing to be done upstream is to simplify the rules."
"We therefore expect, before talking about controls, before talking about a declaration, that things will indeed be simplified upstream for these beneficiaries - especially associations, individuals and so forth."
"The second category of people responsible is, of course, the Member States."
"I and my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development shall not stop pointing to the responsibility of the Member States under the Structural Funds."
"It is they who often add to the administrative complexity and, instead of acting as councils, they complicate matters and sit in judgment."
"Therefore, over and above this Court of Auditors report, we really expect each of the Member States to facilitate access to European funds and, of course, to introduce more adequate controls over coming years."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after making statements of assurance for 14 years, next year represents an anniversary."
"We need to consider what we should do on this occasion."
"I believe that we are gradually making ourselves look ridiculous."
"One of the major risks is that this will degenerate into a routine, that no one will take us seriously any more and that the results which we present will not be taken seriously either."
"The Court of Auditors' Report is an interesting report - the name and shame principle has proved its worth - and I would like to ask the Court of Auditors to continue to provide this kind of clarity."
"However, we are now faced with the question of what to do about the Member States which have been part of the EU since 1981 and still do not apply EU legislation consistently."
"I would like to ask the Commission - and this is one of the lessons which I have learnt from this - to acknowledge that the more consistent the Commission's actions are, the faster we will have improved results."
"I would also like to see this consistent approach being taken in the area for which the Commission itself is responsible."
"I am disappointed that there has been so little progress on direct management."
"I expected the Commission to set a good example and to demonstrate that this is feasible and how it should be done."
"One aspect of this report in particular which interested me is the position of the new Member States, but not very much information is provided in this area."
"I do not understand some of the numbers, for example, your findings on the two new Member States Romania and Bulgaria and what the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) identified there in 2007."
"OLAF has carried out random samples of all the funds which revealed the percentage of fraud and irregularities in these two countries to be 76%."
"This is a significant percentage and it is now time for us to take consistent action and help these two countries to achieve better results, otherwise we will never make progress."
"This annual report is the last from the Barroso Commission and the first in the new financing period."
"I would like to congratulate Commissioner Kallas and the Barroso Commission for their work in the field of financial control."
"The Commission has achieved much more than any of its predecessors."
"It is thought-provoking that despite all of these activities we have not produced better or faster results."
"I am expecting a great deal from the new reporting scheme on recoveries and I hope that we will no longer be in the same situation next year of shrugging our shoulders and saying that things should improve by the following year."
"Commissioner Kallas, so much praise from Mrs Gräßle is really something to be proud of!"
"(DA) Mr President, our discussions can be a little abstract at times, so I therefore think that we should start by reminding ourselves what it is we are actually talking about."
"It is about taxpayers' money."
"It is about European citizens' money."
"Money that is used for quite sensible - and sometimes not so sensible - purposes."
"A common requirement for all the money that is used in the EU's name is that it must be used in a proper and decent manner."
"Another thing that is common to all the money used is that there are rules that must be followed, and if those rules are not followed, a penalty must be paid."
"Unfortunately, we must again this year note that it has not been possible for the Court of Auditors to approve the implementation of the EU budget, that is to say approve the accounts."
"This is, of course, deeply, deeply unacceptable."
"The question is, who should the criticism be directed at, where should we point the finger?"
"There is no doubt that the biggest problem lies within the Member States."
"Unfortunately, there is no doubt that when Member States get a bag of money from the EU they are not so inclined to subject this money to as much control and as many rules as would be the case if it was national money."
"It is clearly stated in the Treaty that it is the European Commission that bears the responsibility, that is to say it is the European Commission that is responsible for there being little pressure on Member States to introduce the necessary controls."
"In this connection, it is a pity that the Commission has not met its own objective for us to approve the accounts before the end of this period."
"We will not achieve this."
"However, I would also like to point out that great progress has been made, for example, following pressure from the European Parliament."
"Last year, an action plan was introduced containing a large number of very specific initiatives, which we will see the effects of - not in this year's report, of course, but in next year's."
"We can be pleased about this."
"In this year's procedure, we will, of course, work in a very targeted manner in relation to the areas in which there are still problems."
"It is, of course, of particular concern that within the agricultural sphere, where there have otherwise been positive trends, we have unfortunately this year seen a somewhat downward evaluation because we do not have a proper hold on things in the rural development funds."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Court of Auditors for its report and the Commissioner and his team for the work they are doing."
"This is such an important subject, because there are so many failing and failed states in different parts of the world - I will not list them as they are obvious - and that is where criminality flourishes and spreads to the rest of us."
"So we have to tackle these problems and I am satisfied that we are moving gradually in the right direction."
"I deeply regret that there is nobody present from the Council, because it is the Member States who are failing to do their job in this area."
"There is not a single person present, and we should try to correct that for next year."
"I want to say one word to the absent Mr Bloom from my country, who made a silly speech about 'knobbly carrots' or something and then walked out and did not have the courtesy to listen to the rest of the debate."
"If he were here, he would hear me remind him that one major British Government department dealing with pensions has failed to have its accounts approved for the last 14 years."
"So, we in Britain have nothing to be proud of either."
"One of the things that baffle me about the UK is that the British Government refuses to cooperate with OLAF, which seems to be completely nonsensical and needs correcting."
"I would love to have an answer from the British Government to that."
"My final point is addressed directly to you, Mr President: when we make recommendations about the committees for the new Parliament next year, I think we should consider seriously how to strengthen the Committee on Budgetary Control - give it extra powers and responsibilities, so that we continue to work very hard on this problem."
"Thank you, Bill Newton Dunn."
"The President will, as always, try to do his best."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it has now become a tradition that once again no statement of assurance can be issued about the relationship between spending at a European level and administration at a national level."
"I can remember discussions with the previous President of the Court of Auditors, Professor Friedmann, who once said to me that, because of the structures, it was not possible to give a statement of assurance."
"For this reason, we should consider how this instrument can be brought to life with the aim of issuing a statement of assurance, if this is justified."
"It is important to make distinctions between a few different issues in this respect."
"Firstly, a budget that consists of around 95% subsidies is much more susceptible to fraud than a national, regional or local authority budget."
"This subsidy budget is largely managed by the Member States, which have demanded a great deal more independence from us in the new financing period, because they complained during the last funding period that there was too much central control."
"Of course, this also means that the responsibility for the budget funds must be transferred to a regional and national level."
"The third area is one that I just want to touch on."
"We must learn to distinguish between fraud and wastefulness."
"These are things which are often lumped together."
"It also annoys me when projects are funded with EU money which are not absolutely necessary."
"However, this is not fraud, but wastefulness."
"For this reason, those with responsibility for the projects, in particular in the area of structural operations, namely the Member States, should also take responsibility for ensuring that money is not wasted and that only those projects are subsidised which provide genuine added value for the region."
"Therefore, we should also consider moving parts of structural operations onto interest-free loans."
"If Member States have to pay back the money, they will only fund the projects that they really need."
"(PT) Mr President, I want to start by congratulating the Court of Auditors on its excellent work and also for having made this work much more accessible to all of us here, and even to European citizens in general."
"However, I should have liked to see more specific details in the Court's report, with names and cases that were analysed."
"This is not a question of doing what some Members call 'naming and shaming', but perhaps rather 'naming and understanding'."
"This is because it is only through a description of specific cases that we can understand the problem."
"As far as I can see, particularly with the Structural Funds, we have regulatory frameworks that often demand absurd things."
"This is down to both the Member States and ourselves, and we have to look at these regulatory frameworks in the greatest of detail."
"We are also going to be discussing the implementation of the European Parliament's budget in 2007."
"The buildings here in Strasbourg were purchased in 2007 and, when we bought them, we were absolutely assured that there was no asbestos in these buildings."
"Only once this purchase had been completed did we find out that there was asbestos in around 50 rooms in this building."
"This is a serious situation to which we must give our full attention."
"That does not mean, ladies and gentlemen, waging war on those who do or do not want to come to Strasbourg."
"We cannot use a health issue for purposes that strictly speaking have no relevance."
"However, the health issue does exist and I should have liked the Secretary-General to give clear guarantees that the proposed asbestos removal plan is compatible with the continued use of these buildings."
"After several months, I am still waiting for these guarantees."
"I have read hundreds of pages of reports and looked at innumerable photographs, some of which have been very interesting, but I do not have these guarantees; we really need them because, without them, we cannot be sure that we can work here in total safety."
"I should therefore like to point out that, when we give discharge of the European Parliament's budget, this issue must be fully clarified because, otherwise, we will not be able to vote positively."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the Court of Auditors."
"Having read their report and listened to the debate here this morning, I ask myself: is the glass half empty, or is the glass half full?"
"The first sentence in the conclusions from the Court states that for 2007 the Court has identified further progress in the Commission's supervisory and control systems, so at least we are going in the right direction."
"There are improvements in certain areas, but the error rate is still way too high in some sectors, and those have been outlined here this morning."
"An extremely important aspect is that, according to OLAF, suspected fraud in the Structural Funds affected 0.16% of payments made by the Commission between 2000 and 2007, and that is a hugely significant figure."
"However, as a politician on the ground, I see the other side of it."
"I am constantly being told by community groups, by voluntary groups, by NGOs, of the huge difficulty they have in applying for funding and adhering to strict compliance rules at every single step."
"I am constantly being bombarded about Brussels red tape and Brussels bureaucracy and, in the middle of citizens and this debate, we have Member States - many of whom need to seriously improve their act - the Commission, which still has some work to do, Parliament and the Court of Auditors."
"I believe, however, that the recommendations from the Court will make a difference, particularly in simplifying the basis of calculation of eligible costs and making greater use of lump-sum or flat-rate payments."
"We are making progress but it is too slow."
"So, is the glass half empty or half full?"
"When I consider the full impact of European funding, the improvements that are being made, and hopefully the implementation of the recommendations, my opinion is that the glass is half full."
"(ES) Mr President, pursuant to Article 274 of the EC Treaty, the Council has the same responsibility as the Commission for expenditure."
"We are the budgetary authority."
"Mr President, did we invite the Council to this debate?"
"I do not see any representatives."
"Have they apologised for not attending?"
"Have they given any reason for not being here?"
"I do not understand."
"Is it because they do not want to hear for the fourteenth time that the Court of Auditors says that things must improve, given that they are the ones spending more than 80% of Europeans' money?"
"Or is it because they, as the Member States, are happy with what they are spending, whereas here in Parliament we have the cheek to question the errors of an absent guest, because I am assuming that they were invited?"
"(FR) I shall say it in French."
"We are in France."
"Where is the French Presidency?"
"Where is Mr Sarkozy?"
"Where is your representation in this debate?"
"(ES) We will have to see whether, in the words of Molière, they arrive ere long."
"This is unacceptable."
"All my colleagues on the Committee on Budgetary Control agree with me that this should not happen again."
"I thought that the excellent French Presidency would also improve this aspect of facing up to the consequences."
"For it is here where they must face up to the consequences."
"They cannot spend and then not come here."
"For it is also the Council, and not just the Member States, that are subject to our scrutiny."
"However, they are never here because they do not want to keep hearing the same thing."
"The solution would be to have national statements."
"I have two points to make."
"Congratulations, Mr Silva Caldeira."
"In this latest debate of this parliamentary term, you have produced a very good report."
"The Court of Auditors, of which you are the President, is partly responsible for things having improved."
"Please convey our congratulations to all your members, as several of my fellow Members have said."
"Mr Kallas, this Commission has improved things considerably."
"Unfortunately, we have not achieved the ultimate goal of a positive Statement of Assurance, but things are going well."
"I have a small suggestion to make: we must simplify."
"We must simplify and give responsibility to the Member States and then they must come here to face up to the consequences."
"Simplification and removal of red tape will be the way to improve how Europeans' money is spent."
"(HU) Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"In my view, for a deputy from one of the new Member States whose absence Mrs Gräßle regretted, the current discharge is important for two reasons."
"On the one hand, this is the first year of the 2007-13 period, thus whatever observations we make now, will have an effect on future uses."
"Secondly, this is the year for which the European Parliament and the Commission will give the last discharge, and therefore it is worth preparing an evaluation."
"Perhaps my fellow Members will not agree with me, but I nonetheless hold the view that although our main goal, a positive DAS, has not been achieved, we can look back with pride at our joint achievements."
"The Commission, under its Vice-President Mr Siim Kallas, and Parliament, under the leadership of the COCOBU, not only saw to it that its own invoices and expenditures were all in order, but with a major, sustained effort succeeded in ensuring that Member States that account for 80% of the expenditures are increasingly prepared to cooperate with regard to inspection."
"I know that in the area of agrarian and cohesion funds we still have serious tasks ahead in this regard, nevertheless when carrying these out we cannot ignore the changing circumstances in the global economy."
"In the current crisis, it is crucially important particularly for the new Member States to use EU resources as rapidly as possible, with the less democracy the better."
"This goal must be attained without thereby increasing the risk to payments."
"For this reason, I welcome the fact that the European Court of Auditors is also proposing simplification in this area."
"Now it is up to the Commission and the Member States to implement these. Thank you very much."
"(FI) Mr President, I wish to thank the European Court of Auditors and Commissioner Siim Kallas for the important work you have done for the sake of European taxpayers."
"A 2% margin of error is permitted in the EU's accounts."
"I would say that it should be possible for the costs set aside for salaries, rent and other administrative items to be finalised with a far greater degree of accuracy."
"There should not be any kind of confusion with these."
"There are other cost groups, however, where achieving an accuracy of within 2% can be difficult."
"For example, there is a lot of talk at the moment about higher figures in the costs of regional policy."
"Perhaps we have to be bold enough to recognise that it is not realistic to achieve zero tolerance in these cost groups."
"In future we need to be a lot more cost-effective, the application procedure must be simplified, and it should also be possible to transfer accountability and authority to national level."
"This would be in the interests of European taxpayers, and I hope that the Court of Auditors will act effectively regarding this."
"(FR) Mr President, I have no wish to take the floor on behalf of the Presidency, but I would like to respond to my fellow Member Mr Pomés Ruiz."
"I believe he may not have been in the House when the rapporteur spoke."
"The Council did not wish to be present in the House before the Ecofin meeting."
"It was quite intentional."
"I do not think that there should be an exchange of views prior to that meeting."
"On the subject of the report, the key word is, I think, simplification."
"However, I believe that shared management is indeed a source of complication at the level of European funds and the degree of complication which we have is not, in all cases, due to fraud, especially in the agricultural sector."
"What we have noted today, especially on the subject of rural development, is due unfortunately to the extremely complex management of European funds."
"We voted on the CAP yesterday and we need to realise that environmental cross-compliance, for example, is highly complicated."
"MEPs are calling for environmental cross-compliance to be simplified, because farmers are working really hard to manage this environmental cross-compliance."
"The European funds - especially the management of the Structural Funds - need to be simplified and this is a political message which we need to get across. Simplification of the European funds is the key word today and it must be heard."
"(BG) My congratulations on the report, which can serve as an operating manual in the complex procedures by which expenses are paid in the European Union."
"I have drawn a number of conclusions about the report: clarity and ease of understanding - it reflects the new working methods introduced by the Court of Auditors; analysis, which gives grounds for important recommendations, albeit ones that have been around for years; and focus on the results."
"Let us look beyond the qualities of the report, and evaluate the results regarding the regularity and effect of European Union expenditure."
"This leads to the following conclusions: weaknesses in Member States' control systems and, to some extent, effective supervision by the European Commission; the distribution of errors in payments made by area is quite high, as are the amounts involved."
"We need to face the substantial level of errors in particular areas."
"Important progress has been made, but it is still not enough."
"The main findings of the report are contained in the recommendations which should improve the system for managing expenditure of European funds: improving control systems at various levels - first, second and third - and the links between them, which is a particular obligation of the Member States; and simplification of procedures to make them easier to control, and also easier to implement risk-free."
"And as it is often the new Member States that are involved, I believe that better cooperation with and assistance is required in respect to the new members to enable them to set up clear and precise national control mechanisms."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Court of Auditors for its presentation this morning, which was extremely detailed and very useful."
"Yes, the error rates are too high - and we all strive for perfection - but progress has been made, and the EU generally has made progress, so that is to be welcomed."
"The general point I would make is that Member States are perhaps more careful with their own money than with European money, and we need to change that mindset."
"However, as others have said, we do not need to overcomplicate the rules and regulations concerning compliance, because that puts people off, and particularly those who might need to have access to funding."
"I have in my hand here - hot off the presses - the health check on the common agricultural policy agreed in the early hours of this morning."
"One thing that strikes me very clearly from the presentation this morning is that it was clearly said that, when it comes to rural development, there are big problems in terms of compliance when, under the health check, we are now taking more money from the single farm payment to pour into rural development."
"There is an issue to be addressed here."
"At the end of the day, putting money into rural development programmes to address climate change, biodiversity and water management is, in theory, a very good idea, but how does one measure these things and assess value for money?"
"That is something we need to look at very carefully."
"I have a concern that this report, as in the past, will be used to beat up on the EU - to say bad things about it - rather than in the way it should be used, which is to say: look, we have made progress and we are pointing to areas where we need to make further improvements, so that we spend European money in a way which is good for the European citizen, and avoid making that overcomplicated."
"The most widely-used word in the House this morning was 'simplification'."
"If it was that simple, then we would already be doing it."
"While I do not think things are quite that easy, perhaps if those who control and inspect were more in tune with the issues on the ground, then it might help the process someway along."
"So, I commend the presentation, and let us hope that we continue to spend well."
"(PL) Mr President, may I first of all express my approval of the Court's report, which confirms the consistency of its work."
"I should also like to point out that these reports are always analysed within a specific context."
"This context is very relevant just now, since first, we are working on a new shape for our policies after 2013."
"Second, we are debating methods of monitoring and judging the effectiveness of our policies."
"And third, we are all working on the European Union's response to the financial crisis and on adapting our tools, methods and instruments to the new challenges."
"In this context, if we look at the effects of the report, which focuses on the cohesion policy, our attention is drawn to the fact that where the Commission itself was responsible for specific actions, the report has identified clear improvement."
"On the other hand, in areas involving multilevel audits and responsibility on the part of Member States, the effects to date, as noted in the report, are slight, because we cannot yet see the direct results of reforms currently being introduced."
"May I also comment that when working on new policies we must clearly distinguish - as was noted by Mr Ferber - between errors, abuses and poor management, and how to relate these to the effectiveness of policies."
"In my view, it is wrong simply to identify an error or the level of error with the ineffectiveness of a specific policy."
"A simplistic drawing of conclusions may cause us to abandon policies which are absolutely essential in the new situation."
"(NL) Mr President, I too should like to add my thanks to the Court of Auditors for the presentation of the annual report and the Commission for its reaction to it."
"Despite the positive noises on the bookkeeping side, we are actually facing the very situation we did in previous years."
"It is true that action has been taken in the area of cohesion, including via the European Commission action plan, and the error rate has decreased slightly from 12% to 11%, but this is less than satisfactory, obviously."
"A twofold picture is emerging where agriculture and other major debit entries on the budget are concerned."
"Agricultural policy's own error rate is under the critical limit of 2%, not least thanks to the integrated control system."
"I do believe, though, that we should mete out stricter penalties for those countries that have failed to carry out this integrated control system effectively for more than ten years, and that we should do this by means of progressive financial corrections."
"In rural development, on the other hand, the picture is less rosy."
"This was to me, as Mr McGuinness has already pointed out, a clear appeal to the Council of Ministers for Agriculture, who met recently, not to move too fast when it comes to transferring monies from agricultural policy to rural policy."
"I have since learnt that whilst the Council did not move as fast as the Commission had liked to see, the proposed modulation is nevertheless considerable."
"These are the problems."
"Now onto the solutions."
"I have heard the Court of Auditors talk in woolly terms about weighing up control costs, simplification and clear objectives."
"This is all well and good, but both the European Commission and the Court of Auditors know all too well that the problem lies with the fact that 80% of the outgoings are co-managed by the Member States."
"It goes without saying, therefore, that the solution should be sought partly via these Member States."
"Imagine my surprise, therefore, on seeing that neither the Court of Auditors nor the European Commission has mentioned national management declarations."
"I should like to remind the Commissioner that, in the context of the previous discharge, he promised that he would commit to these statements, and I should like to know whether he has delivered on his commitment and how this is evident, for I have not seen any evidence."
"Since these declarations are a learning process for us, I think it is important for us to take a closer look at how the present annual summaries and national declarations are put together qualitatively speaking, and to draw the necessary lessons from this."
"I in any event take it as read that the European Commission will help us in this in the coming months."
"(BG) The release of the European Court of Auditors' annual report is a good occasion to analyse what the European Union budget is used for and how it is used."
"The aim of the EU budget is primarily to improve the lives of its almost five hundred million citizens."
"It is used to fund projects that have a direct effect on our citizens' everyday lives, such as roads and motorways."
"As you know, we are currently at a juncture where the 'Eurosceptics' have succeeded in misleading some citizens with empty promises and false assertions."
"Blaming Europe for everything that doesn't work properly is one of the methods they use."
"We, however, must do all we can to allow the citizens of the European Union to reap the benefits of membership."
"We have to send them a strong message that we, as the lawmakers of Europe, want the European Union to function more efficiently and effectively."
"Only in this way will we stop the Eurosceptics from succeeding."
"In this connection I would like to talk of my country, Bulgaria."
"For many years its citizens eagerly awaited the moment they would be able to call themselves equal citizens of the European Union, and would reap the benefits of membership."
"Now, as noted in European reports on various issues, despite joining the European Union, many of my compatriots have been deprived of the benefits of community solidarity, due to mismanagement and weaknesses of the government."
"This was also mentioned in the European Commission's latest report from July 2008, which unfortunately led to a partial freezing of European funds for Bulgaria."
"This situation upsets me deeply, for there is nothing more I want to see than my compatriots living in a prosperous Bulgaria which has taken its rightful place in a united Europe, without accusations of corruption in high places and without organised crime."
"In conclusion, I call upon all European and national institutions to continue in their efforts to correct the failings highlighted in the ECA's annual report, and to fight to continually improve the quality of life of the citizens of the European Union."
"(NL) Mr President, 'catch the eye'."
"I think that this is a topic that catches many people's eye."
"Surely the lack of approval can be attributed to some extent to the level of errors."
"Even after so many years, you have to wonder whether it might be the system that is flawed and needs to be fixed."
"Mr Ferber pointed out that countries that fail to meet the obligations of clarity and own responsibility time and time again must be approached with a different way of financing."
"This can be done, according to him, by providing funds on the condition that these are not spent definitively until later."
"This appeals to me."
"Countries have to choose, certainly when it comes to structural funds, agriculture and rural innovation."
"Mr President, as my friend Mr Bloom quite rightly said earlier, it is simply not true to say that the accounts have been fully signed off by the auditors."
"It seems that about EUR 6 billion cannot be properly accounted for."
"At current exchange rates that is about GBP 4.7 billion."
"Britain's net contribution to the EU budget in 2007 was GBP 4.3 billion."
"The net amount is after the UK rebate and our own money spent in our own country."
"There is of course no such thing as 'EU money'."
"An amount of money exceeding the UK taxpayer's net contribution to the EU budget is quite possibly finding its way into the pockets of fraudsters."
"This neatly sums up British membership of the European Union: a complete and utter total waste of money."
"More and more British people are realising that the European Union..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(BG) I would like to add my congratulations for the report."
"It is very important for me that it underlines the importance of improving the systems for monitoring and controlling European funds and recommends simplification of these procedures."
"I fully agree with the findings and recommendations made to the European Commission, because they are exceptionally fitting."
"I would like to mention here the regrettable example of the ineffective control system mentioned in respect of Bulgaria."
"My country continues to be criticised for irregularities in the management of funding from the pre-accession programmes by several executive agencies."
"This is clear evidence that mismanagement on the part of the Bulgarian government has resulted in misuse, and the results that the pre-accession mechanisms aimed for were not achieved."
"However, I believe that if the Commission had taken and adopted the effective control mechanisms required, this would not have happened."
"Although this is acknowledged in the Commission's answer on page 51 of the report, it is unclear to me exactly what specific measures need to be taken."
"Mr President, Mr Kallas's stated aim at the beginning of his mandate was to achieve a positive statement of assurance, and throughout the different reports we have had from the Court of Auditors in that time, not much, to be honest, has changed."
"I fear, Mr Kallas, that in your reporting and your take on this current report, there is an experience of Peter Mandelson coming through the fibre of your being."
"You have had a touch of the Mandelsons - saying that everything is absolutely fine and spinning that the accounts are clean is disingenuous and simply not true."
"Blaming Member States is not a decent defence, because Article 274 of the Treaty tells you that the buck stops with the Commission."
"Who gives the Member States the monies in the first place?"
"Who, knowing where the problems lie - and you are told every year by the gentleman sat beside you - could tighten the purse-strings or cut off money to fund some programmes?"
"Mr Kallas, the buck does stop with you."
"I am afraid that you have failed."
"Court of Auditors. - Mr President, I wish first of all to thank everyone for their kind words about those working at the Court of Auditors, and all those contributing to the result we have debated here this morning."
"On behalf of all those working at the European Court of Auditors I thank the Members for appreciating what we do to assist the European Parliament as foreseen in the Treaty."
"That is our mandate."
"It is our role."
"We take good note of the comments and suggestions you have addressed to the Court with a view to it further improving the way it presents its results and its findings and communicates these to you and to the citizens of the European Union."
"We will strive to strictly apply international auditing standards in all areas, including when taking into consideration the work of other auditors, namely those engaged in the Member States in auditing European Union funds."
"I shall finish by saying briefly that we will continue to assist the European Parliament and its Committee on Budgetary Control during the discharge procedure, and that we will again strive for full cooperation with all the institutions."
"At the end of the day, the important thing is that the result of our work, as I said in my speech, is a sign that the European institutions are accountable and transparent, and that one can have confidence in the European Union."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, many remarks have been made."
"We have a long process of discharge and discussions ahead of us, during which all these remarks should receive answers and/or comments."
"I would just like to make a comment about simplification, which has been raised many times."
"Everybody says they are in favour of simplification, but in fact, there are two different underlying opinions."
"The first is that the recipients of money want to have more of a free hand, while those contributing that money want a very clear understanding of where the money is going."
"So there is a constant contradiction."
"Secondly, we have until now - although the past two years or so have been different - always assumed that there is zero tolerance for any error."
"The rules are therefore elaborated to prevent any error in the millions of transactions that take place."
"That has also produced some kind of mythological view of the famous declaration of assurance, saying that the underlying transactions of all accounts have errors."
"In fact, as the Court of Auditors says in this report, 95% of all expenditure is free of errors, except in the Structural Funds, where the level of error is higher."
"So the vast majority of spending has been done in accordance with the rules."
"However, zero tolerance of errors is something we will soon be addressing."
"The question of tolerable risks has been raised here many times also, and we will also soon present to Parliament a communication on the intensive discussions which are taking place at the moment in the Commission."
"We have models which clearly show, for instance, that if you want to have zero tolerance - 100% free of errors - then you have the enormous cost of controls."
"Somewhere there is a point where the errors, costs and risks meet."
"In this we highly appreciate the Court of Auditors' approach, first of all towards introducing this kind of quantitative travel light which gives a much better picture."
"Then we will go ahead and see - as one honourable Member said - that maybe in some areas there should be less materiality threshold, and more in others."
"Then we can have a more reasonable interpretation of the requirement of the legality and regularity of transactions."
"The debate is closed."
"Investigations conducted by the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Ingeborg Gräßle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) - C6-0228/2006 -."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, good things come to those who wait."
"As rapporteur I am presenting 92 amendments to you today for the revision of the OLAF regulation, with the request that you approve them."
"This is the first reform of the Anti-Fraud Office since it was established and affects what lies at the very heart of the office, in other words the regulation that controls the essential activities of OLAF."
"The European Parliament has given itself two years to revise this regulation, because OLAF issues always represent dangerous territory for us."
"I am proud of the fact that we in the European Parliament and in the Committee on Budgetary Control were genuinely able to agree and that we remain in agreement."
"We have not fallen out about the details or generally got into a muddle, as the Council often does."
"We agree on the objective of the reform which is to create a more efficient office that can carry out its important tasks more effectively."
"We stand by the office."
"We want it to remain in place and we also want it to be able to carry out its tasks."
"I would like to thank all the employees of OLAF, including the Director General, for their work and to assure them that we need their work."
"I would also like to thank all my fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs, the consultants and the committee secretariat and, of course, my own employees who have shown such commitment to this issue."
"I would like to thank all of you for your wide-ranging support for this work, because this support will represent a success for this Parliament and it is also necessary for its success."
"We have worked together to produce a logical development of the already obsolete draft text produced by the Commission and to enhance it with some genuinely innovative elements, such as the Review Adviser for complaints."
"This will allow us to prevent OLAF from being brought to a standstill and disabled by internal disputes."
"We have made it our priority to improve the way in which the Member States fight against fraud."
"Members of the Council, who are noticeable by your absence once again today, we want to force you to take notice and we will force you to take notice."
"We want the fight against fraud to be a subject that we share."
"We do not want to hold a monologue."
"We want to have a dialogue."
"Once a year we want to have a joint meeting to discuss the major issues relating to the fight against fraud and the problems in the Member States."
"We want to improve the legal protection for those involved in proceedings and to guarantee this protection throughout the entire OLAF investigation."
"For this reason, we have handed over the entire responsibility to OLAF, its judges and its prosecutors."
"We want to ensure that the results of OLAF investigations will stand up in court."
"We want to ensure that national law is taken into account right from the beginning of investigations and that the evidence is obtained under the terms of national law."
"We believe it is highly regrettable that some Member States, such as Luxembourg, have never brought an OLAF investigation to court."
"Any citizens of Luxembourg who are making dishonest use of EU funds have a good chance of getting away scot-free."
"This has a disastrous impact on respect for the law and this is why we are placing such a great emphasis on equal treatment for everyone affected by an OLAF investigation."
"EU officials must not be treated differently from other citizens and ordinary citizens must not be treated differently from EU officials."
"The Commission would be well advised not even to appear to be attempting to do this."
"Commissioner, I am on the warpath about this subject."
"I know that you will reject this point later as unacceptable and that you will insist on this."
"I think that is a pity!"
"The Parliament will definitely not expose you to the temptation of sweeping the findings of investigations involving EU employees under the Commission's carpet."
"We must now convince the Council. The Council is not prepared to negotiate with us over this regulation, but instead aims to consolidate the three legal foundations of OLAF."
"This means that we are wasting a lot of time over an uncertain outcome and we are missing the opportunity to do what is feasible now, to improve the working conditions of the office and to protect the office from criticism concerning those involved in the proceedings."
"We would like the Council to allow us to take those steps which we can take together now."
"Instead of taking the third step before the first step, we should begin at the beginning."
"As rapporteur, I am prepared to come to an agreement with the Czech presidency over an early second reading."
"Where there is a will, there is also a way and I am sure that we can find a joint solution."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Ms Gräßle for her energetic drive in this matter and the Committee on Budgetary Control for forcefully carrying through the debate."
"The Commission appreciates the considerable work of the rapporteur, who was instrumental in taking up this proposal, pending since 2006."
"A first proposal had already been made in 2004."
"Times have changed since 2004 and 2006."
"The largest part of OLAF's work now is not with the institutions but with external parties, conducting anti-fraud investigations throughout Europe and indeed throughout the world, wherever EU funds are spent."
"It has great success in this work, as is widely recognised."
"What remains is a schizophrenic situation, if you allow that analytical term: on the one hand OLAF is a 'normal' Commission directorate general, for which the Commission has full responsibility; on the other hand, it is an investigative function, fully independent in its operations, but for which the Commission is also held responsible."
"Where are the limitations, and where are the limits of independence and accountability in such a set-up?"
"It is our view that with the necessary independence from outside interference of a credible anti-fraud service comes the need for a clear and strong governance set-up."
"Clear rules for investigations and strong accountability arrangements are the mirror of operational independence."
"There are basically only two options: OLAF as part of the Commission, but with clear allocation and separation of responsibility, or make OLAF entirely independent from any EU institution and ensure separate strong oversight and accountability."
"The guiding principles behind the Commission's 2006 proposal were to strengthen the existing OLAF legal framework: a clearer governance set-up for OLAF; reinforced accountability and oversight; reinforced protection of persons under investigation and a reinforced framework for investigations and their follow-up."
"On that basis, the Commission can fully support the amendments proposed in the draft report you are voting on today that are in line with the broad objectives of reform, and can thank you for those developed further."
"On the other hand, the Commission made it very clear throughout the drafting process that some amendments cannot be taken into account in the current situation, simply because OLAF's present status as a Commission directorate-general does not legally permit such changes."
"This includes, for example: OLAF concluding independent cooperation agreements;"
"OLAF's independent appearance before the European Court of Justice; or the European Parliament and the Council deciding on OLAF directorate-general appointments."
"The Commission also made clear that it cannot accept a limited number of proposals which, in their current wording, would depart from the governance improvements envisaged or would remove safeguards contained in the current Regulation."
"This covers, for example, the scope of the governance framework, the procedural rights of persons concerned or a more effective follow-up of minor cases."
"However, the Commission took careful note that, in parallel to the discussion of the current reform proposal, both the European Parliament and the Council repeatedly, and in a particularly insistent manner, stressed their preference for further simplification and consolidation of the entire complex of anti-fraud legislation."
"The upcoming Czech presidency asked the Commission to present a concept paper on that in time for a working-level discussion scheduled during the latter part of its mandate."
"The Commission is therefore striving to present the requested broad reflection paper in early 2009, based on past experience with the existing anti-fraud set-up and the input from the current reform discussion, as well as any other useful elements, as sketched out above."
"The European Parliament will be fully involved in that."
"Let me conclude by stressing again that the Commission is thankful for the support from the European Parliament."
"The Commission is not shying away from openly saying where, in our view, the limits are, but the Commission has been, and will remain, ready to discuss in a spirit of full transparency and cooperation all issues necessary to designing a strong and credible framework for the future of OLAF and a successful fight against fraud."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Bösch."
"He was one of the people who made it possible for OLAF to be established and he was very far-sighted in his view that a body of this kind obviously provides a guarantee for the reputation of European institutions."
"This is what we need on the international stage."
"We need a clear, transparent institution which is accessible to European citizens, which clarifies the situation with regard to the disinformation that generally comes from outside Europe and runs contrary to European interests and, from the other perspective, intervenes in cases of abuse and ensures that abuses are eliminated."
"For this reason, it is also important that the supervisory committee ensures OLAF's independence and, in particular, that the office of the Director General can in future be guaranteed by the Court of Justice."
"This will allow OLAF to carry out its work independently and objectively."
"It is also important that the rights of people who are summonsed or charged by OLAF are clearly demonstrated and this applies also to this House."
"It is also necessary for the rights of these people to be guaranteed in the European Parliament."
"Of course, it is also important to collaborate with third countries and with other institutions in the Member States, in particular with courts of auditors at national and regional level, in such a way that the funds provided by Europe are used for their intended purpose and in the best possible way."
"I would also like to congratulate Mrs Gräßle on the competence and strength of will with which she is ensuring the success of this highly complex dossier."
"I wish her every success and hope that it will soon be implemented."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, thank you, Mr Rübig, for your praise."
"We really should be rather proud."
"It was this committee - and I would like to remind you about someone else as well - it was the Committee for Budgetary Control of this Parliament under the chairmanship of our esteemed fellow Member Diemut Theato who made use of the window of opportunity in the spring of 1999 to create the Anti-Fraud Office."
"We should also remember what the basic principles were. These included, of course, independent investigations and also the fact that OLAF was always regarded as a provisional solution."
"We are waiting until we have a European prosecutor and then OLAF will no longer be what it is today."
"For this reason, we have always emphasised the importance of a powerful supervisory committee and of a high level of independence."
"Some time ago we held a seminar on this subject which confirmed that the independence of OLAF was not, in fact, at risk."
"This is also a compliment to the Commission."
"I have a great deal of understanding for what Mr Kallas has said."
"With this hybrid function that is partially independent and partially dependent, it is not easy to implement something like this and, therefore, I am very curious to see what will be included in a consultation paper."
"Of course it is unacceptable that some of the guarantors of OLAF's independence, in other words the Council, are not taking part in this debate."
"The system cannot work in this way."
"If you are unable to create an independent body, then you can only guarantee independence by ensuring that as many people as possible are tensioning the net, with everyone pulling a bit from different sides."
"Otherwise, OLAF will suddenly find itself hanging from only one thread and will no longer be independent."
"The three bodies which must pull on the net and retain a critical distance from OLAF, because not everything that OLAF does is wonderful, are the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"If we ignore these principles, then OLAF's success will be jeopardised."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work and hope that we make progress in good time, as the previous speaker has said."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Kallas, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur warmly."
"She has put in a huge amount of hard work, which is a rare occurrence these days."
"OLAF is a very special body within the EU: an independent anti-corruption agency which is the envy of other international organisations."
"It was this Parliament - as explained by Mr Bösch and Mr Rübig - which, following bad experiences with OLAF's predecessor, insisted on the independence of the new Anti-Fraud Office."
"We should remember that, at the time, OLAF was only allocated or linked to the Commission for practical reasons."
"Unfortunately, for many people the memories of the scandals of 1999 have already faded, along with any respect for the necessary independence of an anti-corruption authority."
"From today's perspective, the existing safeguards are no longer sufficient to protect OLAF from the exertion of influence and, above all, from increasing blockades."
"Let us be clear about one thing right from the start: OLAF is there to combat fraud."
"It is a body which ensures that taxpayers' money is used appropriately."
"Therefore there are five points which we are supporting by means of this report to promote OLAF's independence:"
"Firstly, the right of the General Director to intervene in cases heard by the European Court of Justice."
"This right ensures that OLAF can consistently defend the results of its investigations."
"The second important guarantee is the right of the supervisory committee, the Commission or another body to bring a case before the European Court of Justice if OLAF's independence is jeopardised."
"This sharp sword is necessary because warnings from the supervisory committee have simply been ignored in the past."
"Thirdly, OLAF's independence is also guaranteed by its obligation to bring before the courts the facts of a case which could constitute the elements of a crime."
"The fourth point is the importance of the skills and strength of character of the people responsible."
"Fifthly, I am pleased that the Director General of OLAF is being reappointed."
"Experience and performance are both important here."
"We should try to avoid denigrating OLAF."
"The experiences of other anti-corruption authorities show that this does not help anyone."
"However, I do agree fully with Mr Bösch that the Council must be involved."
"No French or Czech explanation for this is forthcoming."
"They are not even present and in the end the system simply cannot work like this."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, our debate occurs on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of OLAF."
"The European Anti-Fraud Office rose from the ruins of Jacques Santerre's compromised European Commission, accused of corruption and nepotism."
"Life has shown that OLAF is essential for the efficient functioning of EU administration; at the same time, its existence and operation send a signal to EU Member States, reminding them that European Union bodies are under constant supervision, control and examination."
"OLAF's work raises the prestige of European institutions in its own right."
"The current, well advanced, project is intended to strengthen OLAF's role by first, streamlining its working conditions, second, improving the quality of its operations and third, as noted by previous speakers, strengthening its independence - may I at this point thank the rapporteur."
"The work has been going on for almost four years."
"It was initiated by the European Commission, mindful of the unfortunate experiences of nine years ago, when it was forced to resign."
"The document specifying the new OLAF framework was the subject of consultations with the Council of the European Union, the Court of Auditors and the Data Protection Ombudsman; in addition, importantly, a public hearing was held - in other words, public opinion was consulted."
"The proposals of the public hearing and of the Court's special report resulted in significant amendments to the original proposals of four years ago."
"For instance, it proved necessary to spell out the particulars of cooperation between OLAF and EU Member States and with the European Union's institutions, bodies and organisations."
"A key issue is to achieve real strengthening of OLAF's independence."
"Its personnel must be able to operate in conditions of total independence."
"Where OLAF needs to investigate the allocation of EU funds, whether intended for Member States or for external assistance, the involvement of interested third countries and international organisations must be ensured."
"To streamline its operations, OLAF must be guaranteed immediate and automatic access to European Union fund management data bases, as well as all data bases and important information, by the relevant EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies."
"This would go against the formerly entrenched practice whereby the same institutions sealed themselves off tightly against all controls."
"Member States cannot regard OLAF as an enemy or a redundant institution."
"Every EU state should nominate a body to cooperate with OLAF on a day-to-day basis."
"As is well known, not all our 27 Member States have created specialist national-level services to coordinate combating financial abuses involving EU funds."
"We need close cooperation between OLAF and Europol, as well as OLAF and Eurojust."
"OLAF must also act transparently in the matter of its investigative procedures and guarantees, verification of the lawfulness of its investigations and appeal procedures for those already suspect or soon to become suspect."
"Where procedures involving Member States are concerned, the audits could be carried out by representatives of the relevant Member States."
"Representatives of judicial authorities, and in fact those involved in OLAF structures, could participate."
"This is the main thrust of the amendments."
"At the same time, I oppose the imposition of excessive sanctions on European institution officials guilty of unauthorised disclosure of information about specific offices and potentially corrupt practices."
"The case of a colleague, Mr van Buitenen, today an MEP but formerly a European Commission official, suggests that in the past those who were victimised were not those guilty of abuses but those who drew attention to those abuses, pursued and disclosed them."
"Let this experience serve as a warning also when we come to specific provisions relating to penalties and sanctions to be imposed on whistleblowers."
"Finally, the citizens of Member States frequently overzealously identify corruption and abuse with European institutions."
"To counteract this tendency, we need greater transparency in the operation of EU bodies, and certainly better information about investigations and the methods used by the European Union to combat corruption."
"It is a big mistake to conceal such information under the pretext that its disclosure will damage the prestige of the EU."
"Quite the contrary, we must publicise such matters, to make the citizens and taxpayers of European Union Member States aware that we do not sweep theft shamefully under the carpet."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an exercise in making legislation in the framework of the codecision procedure."
"This means cooperation between Parliament and the Council, the latter of which, indeed, appears to be absent."
"Let us be honest."
"The French Presidency is not in the slightest bit interested."
"This also explains their absence."
"I do hope Mrs Gräßle will reach agreement at first reading with the Czech Presidency, but somehow I do not think this will happen."
"The Chechens will not display much in the way of decisiveness either."
"In addition to the five points which Mr Chatzimarkakis listed and which I fully endorse, I should like to list another ten points which we in the Committee on Budgetary Control deem important in the cooperation with Mrs Gräßle and which we, in fact, consider absolutely essential."
"First of all, we are in favour of improved cooperation between OLAF and Eurojust when it comes to exchanging information on cross-border crimes between more than two Member States."
"The cooperation agreement between OLAF, Eurojust and Europol is of huge importance."
"Secondly, we would like to see the role and the duties of the Director-General of OLAF, the anti-fraud office, better described."
"That way, we can also call him to account."
"Thirdly, we would like to see the tasks of the OLAF staff better described."
"A requirement should be introduced to make investigations last less than 12 months and extend them by a maximum of 6 months."
"If an investigation lasts over 18 months, then feedback should be given to the supervisory committee."
"Fourthly, the rights of the defence must be clearly reinforced."
"Fifthly, journalists' sources must enjoy specific guaranteed protection."
"Sixthly, we need clearer agreements about the role and relationship between OLAF and the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Seventhly, we need clear rules about the openness of information intended for the general public."
"Eighthly, the role of the supervisory committee, including in terms of staff and the composition of the committee itself, must be reinforced."
"They should be experts, appointed for five years, with investigative experience in the judicial world."
"Ninthly, we need a better procedure for the appointment of the Director-General."
"Tenthly, the role of whistle blowers and of people under investigation must be better protected."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, the EU's money streams are prone to fraud."
"Since a huge chunk of its outgoings are related to the common agricultural policy and regional funds, the Union is becoming nothing but a middleman."
"As a result, responsibility is shared with others who consider the pledged funds as their own."
"Collecting funds centrally to subsequently share them out to interested parties or projects in municipalities or provinces renders control more difficult."
"This week, we invited the Council to agree that more funds should be given for school fruit."
"An arrangement of this kind is useful for the children's health, but this is best organised on a small scale at local level rather than the most large-scale level we know in Europe."
"We may be able to reduce the risk of fraud considerably by focusing money streams on budget support or levelling contributions for the poorer regions, with the only criterion that the residents of those areas must be given every opportunity of staying in their regions of origin to live and work."
"If we remove discrepancies in income, create jobs and provide good facilities, much of the labour migration will become unnecessary."
"This will also reduce the ensuing problems."
"We have not reached that stage yet."
"As long as the outgoings remain prone to fraud, extensive checks and fraud control will need to remain in place."
"A high level of funding and staffing are not enough: The anti-fraud office OLAF can only function properly if it can be completely independent and critical in respect of the Commission and Council."
"When the present Director was appointed, the recommendation by an independent selection panel that put forward the seven most suitable candidates was put aside."
"The Commission considered the present Director to be its favourite candidate from the outset."
"He is also rumoured to want to exert too much influence over the selection of his staff, making them too dependent on him."
"None of this does anything to boost confidence in the seriousness of fraud control."
"Many voters consider this chaotic Europe as a fraud paradise."
"Moreover, it appears that whistleblowers cannot pass on their suspicions related to fraud to OLAF in a safe manner."
"If their roles leak, they can be dismissed for violating secrecy by way of penalty."
"Moreover, all too often, we wait until the press drags a scandal into the public arena and the statute of limitations has run out on offences."
"Also, there is not enough provision for hearing both sides of the argument."
"Too many investigations are delayed or stopped before a satisfactory outcome has been reached."
"The Gräßle report makes the first small steps in the right direction."
"It could lead to more autonomy for OLAF, to less control of the working method by the European Commission and to better protection for those involved."
"My group supports these first steps, but we do not labour under the illusion that they will solve the problem."
"The supervisory committee will need to be strengthened further and codecision about amending this Regulation No 1073/1999 must not be delayed or stopped."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, there have been countless scandals as a result of corruption, fraud and irregularities throughout the EU's history."
"Public trust in the EU is low."
"In Sweden, we measure the Swedish people's trust in various institutions each year."
"At the top we find, for example, the health care service, the police and the royal family, and lower down come the politicians, trade unions and the evening papers."
"At the very bottom are the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"This pattern is consistent."
"Thus, the EU needs an effective anti-fraud authority."
"But we have had bad experiences of OLAF, including a lack of independence, a lack of transparency, secret lobbying in connection with the appointment of the director general and the Supervisory Committee."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Gräßle, has put a lot of work into guaranteeing independence, transparency and strict observation of the rules."
"I call on the House to give its full support to Mrs Gräßle's proposal."
"It is an important first step on the EU's long path, if possible, to win the trust of its citizens."
"Allow me to finish by making a particularly strong plea in favour of an amendment that I myself have put forward."
"This requires all EU bodies to respect journalists' sources."
"After the scandalous Tillack affair, where the actions of the OLAF leadership warrant sharp criticism, this reform is absolutely necessary."
"In the end it was the European Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg that fully acquitted Tillack last year."
"Neither OLAF, the European Parliament nor the European Court of Justice accepted their responsibility."
"(NL) Madam President, it is very important for the European Union to have an efficient and well-developed anti-fraud office, all the more so given how much budgets are increasing and foreign aid growing, without it always being possible to monitor effectively whether the deployed means are spent wisely."
"I think that public opinion, the tax payer in other words, often questions this, with good reason."
"This report contains a large number of sound proposals and I for one will be endorsing it, even though I believe that more thought should be given to OLAF's independence."
"OLAF is a Directorate-General of the European Commission, and the political responsibility rests with the Vice-President of the Commission."
"Operationally and in terms of research, the office is independent, but this hybrid status is potentially problematic, to say the least."
"I am convinced that independent status could only reinforce the office's clout."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Dr Gräßle."
"Our rapporteur tried to reconcile all the parties and by doing this she could identify current problems, could find practical solutions and could find compromise."
"At present things are not too satisfactory."
"We see the Court of Auditors refusal to sign off the EU's account for the 14th time in a row due to the number of irregularities and fraud cases which involve EU money."
"It is high time to support a tougher approach tackling the misuse of EU funds."
"Since the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's office is postponed, it is high time to move forward in the fight against fraud by strengthening the independence of the European Anti-fraud Office and by strengthening the investigative power of OLAF."
"There is an important point in the Gräßle report: strengthening cooperation with the Member States."
"Although the regulation states that all national and international partners must provide all the cooperation necessary, there is no detailed legal basis for such cooperation."
"The number of obstacles even increases when we come to cross-border anti-fraud cooperation."
"There is a great need, therefore, for the amended regulation which comprises a better cooperation management between OLAF and the competent authorities of the Member States."
"The only institution which really has the means to protect the financial interest of the EU is the European Parliament."
"If we do not stand up for the fight against corruption and fraud, there is no one to replace us."
"Finally, I would like to raise an interesting point."
"While the European countries are among the so-called 'cleanest countries' in the 2008 Global Corruption Perception Index, according to recent studies these wealthy countries like to show preference for using illegal means, for example bribery, in their outside overseas businesses."
"I agree with all those who find these double standards unacceptable."
"(ES) Madam President, I want to start by congratulating Mrs Gräßle and in particular thanking her for her openness to suggestions and proposals."
"I can say that - and I congratulate you on this - you successfully led a dynamic work team to achieve the best possible results."
"Congratulations, Mrs Gräßle!"
"I believe that the most important element in this text, which my Group at least also fought for and on which Mrs Gräßle's attention was focused, is the guarantee that the rights of citizens under investigation will be protected."
"The principles of presumption of innocence, privacy and confidentiality, the procedural guarantees and also the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union will from now on be the key points of this procedural code for OLAF investigations."
"We want this to be published as soon as possible and to be sent - in fact it must be sent - to the Review Adviser appointed for this purpose so that a response can be given to citizens' complaints within 30 working days."
"The role of the Supervisory Committee has also been reinforced."
"This must protect the independence of OLAF through regular monitoring of the implementation of its investigative function."
"In addition, and this is something I must highlight and which I assume Mrs Gräßle will also highlight, it can appear before the Court of Justice, as can the Director General, who can also bring the institutions before the Court of Justice."
"This was something that the rapporteur was keen to ensure."
"In this way, the role of the Director General of OLAF will also be more protected and have greater safeguards."
"The role of the European Parliament in the institutional conciliation procedure is also reinforced."
"I believe that this is an important and innovative element."
"Although we would have preferred not to increase the extension periods, because two years still seems to us to be too long, we understand that investigations can be difficult and complex."
"However, we hope that the Commission - and here I must also thank Mr Kallas for his openness and for the support that he gave us - after the four-year period when the report on the regulation's implementation should be presented to us, will be able to tell us how we can improve this point of reducing the investigation periods as far as possible."
"We are still hoping for a European Public Prosecutor, a desire that we share with the rapporteur. Thank you, Mrs Gräßle!"
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, I am filled with sadness."
"At Mrs Gräßle's proposal, OLAF is unwittingly being accorded additional powers, while OLAF itself is not subject to adequate supervision."
"In 1999, the then Committee of Wise Men predicted that, as an internal Commission office, OLAF would refuse to work with a powerless supervisory committee."
"The effects are clear for everyone to see."
"Unhindered by accountability and control, OLAF's management, and particularly its Director-General, has slipped up time and again."
"Staged staff selection, violation of the rights of the defence, concealment of evidence and submission of criminal dossiers with lapsed prosecution deadlines."
"The pièce de résistance is OLAF's own dreamed up charge of bribery against a journalist who was too well informed for OLAF's liking."
"In fact, OLAF even managed to secure a house search, at which point the journalist's belongings were confiscated."
"OLAF subsequently lied about the full facts to the Commission, Parliament, the law courts, the ombudsman and the public prosecutors in Belgium and Germany for years."
"In fact, OLAF has sent its own researchers out with false information."
"How far can they take this?"
"The Commission is aware of this, and says this has to stop, but claims it is not authorised to act."
"This is precisely why the Commission has withdrawn this proposal."
"As you already indicated, it was made with the best of intentions."
"Our increasing insight into current abuses, though, make it necessary for a different supervisory body to monitor OLAF, and one of the options indicated by yourself is coming to an end."
"The solution is an independent OLAF which operates independently of the Commission and under competent supervision, that is not appointed by politicians but by public prosecutors of the Member States, until such time as a European public prosecution is formed."
"(DE) Madam President, the fact that the European Union has such a poor public image unfortunately has a great deal to do with OLAF."
"I agree with the previous speaker that OLAF is neither fish nor fowl and it takes a characteristically arbitrary approach."
"OLAF employees have been coming to me and telling me how depressing things are, that two types of measurements are used and that no clear standards are set."
"One OLAF employee even compared OLAF's practices with those of the secret police, in other words, an undemocratic institution."
"The occasion was, of course, once again the so-called Galvin report, the internal report in which many of the practices of Members of the European Parliament are disclosed which, if OLAF were to use the same standards, would have led to large-scale investigations, including one of Herbert Bösch, who refers to himself as the father of OLAF."
"What is happening in this case to the German Members among others?"
"What is happening to many other Members?"
"Instead of taking the correct approach and doing what was done in my case, in other words, saying that we are acting on our own initiative, where there is clear suspicion of fraud, for example tax evasion or illegal party funding, OLAF sits back and does nothing."
"Of course, this also has a lot to do with the personal approach of the current Director General."
"This is a challenge for you, Commissioner."
"What is happening here is not worthy of a democracy."
"In my case, they made up technical errors and searched and searched."
"In the end there was no truth in the accusations, which was embarrassing for OLAF."
"However, in cases where there may be some truth in the suspicions of fraud, they do nothing and simply look the other way."
"For this reason, I am of the opinion that many EU officials work in the same way as OLAF and that an EU officialdom of this kind can no longer be supported, that many EU officials should be brought before a court and that we need true democracy at a European level at last, with separation of powers, and not an OLAF like the one we currently have!"
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to clarify that Mr Martin, who is just coming in, has stated in one of his points, that OLAF should have investigated Mr Bösch."
"That should not be allowed."
"It would mean that there is a suspicion of fraud in this case, because I know that OLAF can only carry out investigations in the case of suspected fraud."
"I would ask the Bureau to resolve this issue."
"I reject the accusation."
"This sort of thing simply should not be allowed!"
"I hope that appropriate measures are taken against Mr Martin."
"Without any evidence, he has stated that OLAF should have taken proceedings against Mr Bösch and other German fellow Members."
"This should not happen and I expect measures to be taken in this case."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Madam President, the Member States, Europol and Eurojust will now have to concern themselves on a regular basis with OLAF's findings."
"The information provided by the European Anti-Fraud Office will pass directly to the police and to the justice system and will be binding."
"As a member of the Committee on Regional Development, I warmly welcome this reform."
"OLAF must make use of its new powers, because the structural funds are a major problem for us."
"The number of irregularities has increased dramatically and the amount of damages rose from EUR 43 million in 1998 to EUR 828 million in 2007."
"This increase is not acceptable."
"Therefore, it is good that we are improving the controls and the prosecution process."
"However, we must also press more strongly for the Member States to publish the names of their subsidy recipients."
"We should also explain one of the causes of the abuse."
"I am of the opinion that we put too little emphasis on the responsibility of the regions when we allocate the funds."
"For this reason, we must increase the mandatory joint financing by the regions and the project promoters and we must offer more loan-based programmes."
"If the recipients of the funding can identify more closely with the potential lasting success of their projects, there will be less abuse and less work for OLAF."
"Madam President, before I make my point, I would just like to make a comment to my colleague, Mr Martin."
"Whilst he has some very valid points to make, in his scattergun approach he should not try and take out an honest, decent and good man like Mr Bösch, who in my experience of his chairmanship of the Committee on Budgetary Control - even though we might disagree on many points - is exactly what I have described him as."
"My concern with OLAF's problem is that it has a huge conflict of interests going on."
"It is not necessarily OLAF itself, but the strange relationship whereby it is part of the Commission, even though it is occasionally called upon to investigate that body."
"That is why I am concerned that OLAF, which was born following the 1999 'Wise Men's' report - and that report called for it to be independent of the Commission - spends less and less of its time investigating internal Commission matters."
"Certainly some of its other investigations are very sexy and exciting, but I am not convinced that Mrs Gräßle's report addresses the problems of OLAF's independence in this way."
"Finally, I am concerned that there is another level of conflict of interests."
"Should OLAF members of staff be allowed to have relatives working in parts of the EU institutions that they might be investigating?"
"Indeed, should we not - this Parliament that has banned spouses from working for MEPs - now extend this call to say that only one family member should work in any of the EU institutions to prevent such future conflicts of interests?"
"(DE) Madam President, I believe that it is particularly important for OLAF to make a distinction between disinformation, which in some cases is controlled from outside Europe, and the bureaucratic treaties which are often 50 to 60 pages long and the manuals of over 600 pages, where, of course, the most errors occur."
"We should explain here that clear and simple regulations are much easier to follow than complex and comprehensive ones."
"This is why I am specifically calling on the Council to improve the basic conditions as quickly as possible."
"We need OLAF for transparency and justice in Europe."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I am grateful for all the remarks, which reflect very clearly the controversial nature of this topic."
"As Ms Gräßle mentioned, this proposal started in 2004, when times were completely different."
"I like the expression 'there is a conflict of interests'."
"There is a clear institutional conflict of interests between independence and accountability."
"We must continue to work and have this debate."
"Whatever will happen cannot happen without collaboration between Parliament, the Council and the Commission on how to solve this conflict of interests."
"As I have said, there are not many, but some, possibilities."
"Most of you clearly support the idea of greater independence, which also means greater accountability."
"Let us find out what is possible."
"There are certain clear limits within the Commission."
"It is very clear that the directorate general cannot go independently to the courts: it is not possible within the legal framework."
"A very important point mentioned by many of you was the right to go to the Member States."
"Again, it is the Commission that takes action in the Member States, and there are clear limits to the extent of involvement by the Commission which is acceptable to Member States."
"The Commission is accountable here and to the public for OLAF's activities, so we would be very happy to have a more independent OLAF, which could go independently to the courts and be independently accountable, with a separate discharge."
"We would welcome all these things and also very clear supervision both of the investigations and of the content of those investigations."
"At present we do not have a public prosecutor."
"This is what we await, but while we are waiting we must find some other solutions."
"Let us continue this work."
"As I said, we will formulate a concept paper on the basis of this discussion."
"I am looking forward to fruitful debates with the honourable Members and the rapporteurs on this issue."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the debate."
"I believe that the Commissioner has now realised how important the independence of OLAF is to this Parliament."
"I would also like this debate to be included in the discussions which we will now be holding."
"I would like to request that we start these discussions gradually, that we exchange ideas about the amendments and that we do not reach the position of saying 'that is not possible'."
"This is the will of Parliament."
"We are part of the codecision-making procedure and we will require the EU Commission to take part in the procedure as well."
"We are supporting you."
"We want you to retain your influence on OLAF, but you must exert your influence in the right place and provide OLAF with more support than was previously the case."
"We are only partially satisfied and that is also the result of the work of the EU Commission."
"There are many subjects on the table which need very serious discussion."
"I am ready for this and I am looking forward to the debate."
"However, I would like there to be a sort of loosening-up exercise at the start of the debate for the Commission, because there is no point in us even sitting down together if everything that you have presented today is already cast in concrete and set in stone."
"We must talk very seriously together about what is possible and also what is not possible."
"I would like to reject two points."
"One is the distorted image of OLAF which some fellow Members are painting on the basis of their own small-minded self-interest."
"It is a distorted image which has nothing to do with reality."
"I would like to make sure that OLAF is aware that this image does not represent the majority opinion of the House."
"We believe that OLAF is doing an important job and this also applies in the case of Mr Martin."
"It was not the case that there was no truth in the story."
"However, it was true that the Austrian state prosecutor's office did not want to follow up on the results of OLAF's investigation."
"That happens frequently."
"You, Mr Martin, must also speak the truth in this House."
"This applies to you too."
"I would like to say to Mr van Buitenen that I very much regret that you did not accept the offers of cooperation."
"We have spoken together twice, but I do not believe that you can look at OLAF on the basis of individual cases."
"Something always goes wrong in organisations, but looking at the whole organisation on the basis of these individual cases does not give the right picture."
"I have tried not to do this. I would like to make this very clear."
"On a personal level, I hold you in high esteem and I have read all your books."
"However, I believe that there are different ways of working and in politics we always run the risk of coming to the wrong conclusion by focusing on individual cases."
"I believe that the report in front of us is a good one."
"(DE) Madam President, I refer to Articles 145 and 149 on personal statements, which allows me three minutes."
"What is happening here is simply outrageous."
"OLAF is making something out of nothing and making an accusation against me on the basis of its own investigations."
"This had a huge impact on our election success in 2006."
"A year later the state prosecutor decided that there may have been a few small technical errors, but that they did not under any circumstances justify an investigation of any kind. No proceedings were taken and the whole thing was abandoned."
"Nothing happened at all."
"What Mrs Gräßle has said here is slander."
"It is a continuing attempt to destroy my reputation."
"This is exactly how OLAF exploits the situation."
"If OLAF comes to a conclusion, but the Member States do nothing, then the person is still guilty."
"That is a complete scandal!"
"Where are the double standards in this scandal, Mrs Gräßle?"
"The double standards lie in the fact that where there are genuinely suspicious circumstances relating to Members of this Parliament, relating to other Members, no investigation is carried out and nothing at all is done."
"This is undermining democracy in Europe."
"This is because a secret tool which is under political control is being used to speak out and to act against troublesome opponents and then attempts are made to make something out of this and genuinely false statements are made, despite the fact that government institutions - and I have a high opinion of the relatively independent Austrian judicial system - say that there is no truth in it."
"This is a slap in the face for every voter and a slap in the face for Europe's credibility."
"If you are elected with 14% of the vote and then you are humiliated like this and incorrect facts are passed on repeatedly, this ruins what was previously regarded as a fair and integrative system."
"You are damaging Europe and destroying democracy, Mrs Gräßle!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Review of recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspection in the Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the Oral Question - B6-0479/2008) by Mr Ouzký to the Commission, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States."
"author. - Madam President, it is difficult to stand up now after that particularly lively debate and switch to another topic!"
"I would like to stress that the good and consistent enforcement of environmental legislation is essential for its credibility, for a level playing field and for ensuring that the environmental objectives will be met."
"The issue of environmental inspections is, therefore, very important for the work of my committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"On 14 November the Commission published the communication on environmental inspections in the Member States."
"This communication reviewed Recommendation 2001/331/EC of the European Commission, providing minimum criteria for environmental inspections."
"The communication contains some worrying messages."
"It states that the information submitted by the Member States on the implementation of the recommendation is incomplete or difficult to compare."
"It states that there are still large differences in the way environmental inspections are being carried out in the EU."
"It states that the scope of the recommendation is inadequate and that it does not include many important activities such as Natura 2000 and the control of illegal waste shipping."
"It states that inspection plans have not been implemented and where they do exist that they are often not publicly available."
"My committee noted with concern the conclusions from the Commission stating that the full implementation of the environmental legislation in the Community cannot be ensured."
"This would not only lead to continuing damage to the environment, but also to the distortion of competition within and between the Member States."
"My committee therefore formulated four questions to the Commission, which can be summarised as follows."
"First, why does the Commission only wish to amend the recommendation - why does it not propose a directive on environmental inspections?"
"Second, why has the Commission opted instead for attaching environmental inspection requirements to existing directives individually, a process that will take a lot of time?"
"Third, why is the Commission not prepared to use a directive to define terms such as 'inspection' and 'audit', which are interpreted in different ways by Member States?"
"Fourth, why is the Commission not prepared to transform IMPEL into an effective EU environmental inspection force?"
"I would like to thank the Commission in advance for its reply and I would like to conclude by emphasising that, in my opinion, the implementation and enforcement of environmental legislation should get the same political attention as the adoption of the legislation in the Commission, in the Council and in Parliament."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I am very happy to be presenting my green credentials in addition to my anti-fraud credentials, so changing topics is also a pleasure."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for this discussion on the very important topic of environmental inspections."
"Recognising the need for EU-wide action, Parliament and the Council adopted the recommendation on environmental inspections in 2001."
"The objective was to lay down common criteria for environmental inspections in order to ensure a better and more consistent implementation of environmental legislation through the Community."
"At the time there was a long discussion on whether these criteria should be binding or non-binding."
"As a compromise, a non-binding recommendation was adopted."
"Member States pledged to implement it fully and the Commission was asked to review this decision on the basis of the experience with the implementation of the recommendation by the Member States."
"The Commission launched the review process with its communication of November 2007."
"In this communication the Commission concluded that, although the recommendation has led to improvements in environmental inspections in some Member States, it has unfortunately not been fully implemented in all Member States."
"The Commission thus put forward its preliminary views on how the situation could be improved."
"The measures that we deem necessary are: firstly, a modification of the recommendation to make it stronger and clearer, including a better reporting mechanism; secondly, where necessary, to complement the recommendation with legally binding inspection requirements in individual directives; and thirdly, to continue supporting the exchange of information and best practice between inspectorates in the context of IMPEL."
"The Commission is now gathering the input of the other institutions and of stakeholders on these initial proposals and will then present its final proposals."
"Now, coming to the questions raised, I would like to make the following remarks."
"Firstly, I would like to clarify that the views presented in the Commission's communication of November 2007 do not exclude the possibility of the Commission presenting a proposal for a directive on environmental inspections in the future."
"The Commission's view, as expressed in its communication, is that there is a need for EU-wide legally binding rules to ensure effective environmental inspections."
"In that respect we have the same position as Parliament."
"The question is, however, whether such rules should be horizontal and cover all environmental inspections or whether they should be sectoral and apply to specific installations or activities."
"Both of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages."
"A horizontal approach would be simpler and quicker to put in place."
"On the other hand, the sectoral approach would enable us to better address the specific aspects of the different installations or activities."
"For instance, the requirements for inspections of waste shipments are completely different from those for the inspection of industrial installations."
"By being more targeted we could set more effective requirements."
"To some extent, the sectoral approach is the one that we have already been practising for several years."
"For example, in the Seveso II Directive, we have provisions on inspections of installations in order to prevent accidents."
"These provisions have proven to be very successful."
"We have now included inspection requirements in our proposal to revise the IPPC Directive."
"Another sector where we see the need for further action is the implementation of the EU Waste Shipment Regulation."
"The growing problem of illegal waste shipments is a risk for human health and the environment."
"There is clear evidence of illegal shipments recorded during joint EU waste shipment inspections coordinated by IMPEL."
"Recent trade data and studies on the export of certain waste streams, in particular electrical and electronic waste and end-of-life vehicles, indicate that significant volumes leave the EU."
"In many cases these shipments seem to violate the EU Waste Shipment Regulation's export bans."
"Serious incidents of EU exports for dumping of waste in developing countries, such as the Côte d'Ivoire incident in 2006, as well as a recent Greenpeace report about waste illegally shipped to West Africa, underline the severity of the problem."
"The Commission is currently examining the need for additional initiatives, including improved legislative requirements, in order to further and strengthen the inspections and controls of waste shipments."
"As we stated in our communication, we also see a need to establish common definitions for terms that are relevant for inspections."
"For this purpose we think that a horizontal recommendation would be an appropriate instrument."
"As regards the idea of transforming IMPEL into an EU environmental inspection force, IMPEL was created as an informal network of Member States' inspection authorities."
"Its objective is to facilitate exchange of information and best practice between the people who are actually applying environmental legislation in the Member States."
"I think we should preserve this role of IMPEL of bringing together the expertise of inspectors and allowing for an informal exchange of ideas at European level."
"From the Commission's side we will continue our support to IMPEL and reinforce our successful cooperation."
"This year IMPEL was transformed from an informal network into an international association."
"This will not only give IMPEL more visibility but also open new possibilities of activities for IMPEL."
"To go further and create an EU environmental inspection force with powers of entry and powers to refer Member States to the Court of Justice is an interesting and ambitious idea. However, it would raise important legal and institutional questions."
"We should also look at the instruments for the improvement of the enforcement of EU environmental legislation at our disposal at present and consider whether these could be further developed or put to better use."
"For example, the horizontal infringement cases that the Commission launched against Member States for systematic failure to enforce certain obligations, such as for the presence of thousands of illegal landfills in some Member States, have led to the establishment of improved enforcement strategies in the Member States."
"Another example of an initiative that has led to better enforcement is the joint inspections of waste shipments throughout the Community organised within the framework of IMPEL with the support of the Commission."
"We would consider ways to reinforce this cooperation and encourage all Member States to participate in it."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I find what the Commissioner has said rather disappointing."
"I know that he is standing in for Mr Dimas and could not help but read out what was given to him, but I think we need rather more than that."
"Environmental legislation is something that most people - perhaps all people - in this Chamber are in favour of - perhaps even including UKIP, who are apparently not here and are perhaps ironing their Union Jacks."
"The trouble is that we do not know what is happening in the Member States, and the proposals from the European Commission go only a very little way to improving that situation."
"We, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, are still in favour of having a directive rather than a recommendation."
"I do not, myself, see why we could not have a general directive regarding environmental inspections and specific rules attached to specific directives where that is appropriate."
"Let me then turn to the question of an EU environmental inspection force."
"It is perhaps a little strange that this idea comes forward from the mouth of a British Conservative - vote Blue, go Green - but we do need this, because, otherwise, the Commission is entirely dependent on the Member States for the information that they choose to give it."
"It is extraordinary that nine years after the Landfill Directive came into force, Spain is now being prosecuted before the European Court of Justice for having 60 000 illegal landfills, taking up more than half-a-million tonnes of illegally dumped waste."
"We think we know what is happening south of Naples."
"The Birds Directive adopted in 1979 is still being widely neglected."
"The Commission often finds that its prosecutions before the Court of Justice on environmental matters are initiated by private citizens."
"I do not think that this is good enough."
"We should tell the people of Europe that we cannot be sure that the environmental legislation which we are adopting is being complied with."
"Given the fact that we are now looking at climate change legislation, that is very serious."
"We must return to the issue of an EU environmental inspection force, which I fully support."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, on behalf of my group and as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, may I express my full support for the questions."
"I share Members' concerns expressed in these questions."
"The Commission's Communication of November 2007 does indeed give rise to many controversies and to doubts among all those concerned about the environment and those who wish environmental law not simply to be made in the European Parliament, but to be enforced, and to be enforced in the spirit in which it was intended."
"To achieve this, we need an effective system of monitoring introduction and compliance with the law, which we still have not developed."
"We have national systems which operate divergently and differently, while at the EU level we have a recommendation."
"As we all know, recommendations are not binding."
"This is stipulated in Article 249 of the Treaty of Rome, which specifies the differences between a directive and a recommendation."
"I would therefore ask the Commission to treat the matter with all seriousness and to present the whole system of compliance monitoring, inspection and the resultant reports in the form of a binding instrument, a directive on compliance with environmental law in the European Union."
"We cannot leave the matter where it is now and we cannot expect that amending one of the 2001 recommendations, that is, adding new Member State duties to the recommendation, will change anything."
"Commissioner, it will change nothing at all."
"The fact is that it we want to have effective environmental laws, we must have an effective enforcement and monitoring system."
"To repeat: you have asked whether we should introduce sectoral or global monitoring regulations."
"I on the other hand want to ask whether you would like to protect the whole of the environment or only individual sectors."
"And this gives you the answer."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, in recent years, we in the European Parliament have approved a great deal of environmental legislation."
"The environment is at the top of the agenda, and rightly so."
"The important thing, though, is not just to produce legislation: it also needs to be implemented, and this is exactly where the problems appear to be."
"According to information from the European Commission, the implementation of environmental policy leaves something to be desired at times."
"Current environmental inspection policy is contained in the recommendation, which is interpreted quite differently in various Member States."
"It has also been reported that environmental inspections have been carried out incompletely, all of which means that, despite existing environmental legislation, the environment does not always benefit."
"If we want the quality of the environment to improve, we must, as an absolute priority, put effective controls in place to ensure that this legislation is implemented."
"Commissioner, you claim to be presenting your green credentials."
"In this respect, though, there is still quite a bit to be done."
"I myself was rapporteur for a regulation on the transfer of waste in 2007 and before, and there is much room for improvement in that area."
"In the context of better implementation of environmental policy, would you be prepared to make the existing recommendation binding?"
"(PL) Madam President, I share the view of the European Commission that large discrepancies exist between the different methods of monitoring environmental compliance used by different Member States, which make it impossible to ensure consistent introduction and enforcement of EU law."
"In my work as an MEP I have had the opportunity to study the results of a number of IMPEL projects, including one concerning the crossborder movement of waste through sea ports."
"I have discovered that cooperation between the various IMPEL inspection services consists not only of the sharing of experience, but also, and perhaps even most importantly, of joint monitoring operations and exchange of information about environmental crimes and offences."
"Some dishonest companies deliberately transfer their unlawful operations to countries where they know the control system to be weaker and where they can continue to operate with impunity."
"If control systems in all Member States were uniform, this would not be happening."
"This is another argument in favour of the European Union having an efficient and uniform system for monitoring facilities for compliance with environmental requirements."
"Inspections are an important instrument in the process of introduction and enforcement of EU laws, but in spite of this Member States give them different political priorities."
"This is why I fully support the European Commission's proposal amending the existing recommendations to make them more effective."
"I agree with the proposal to include legally binding requirements concerning the inspection of specific facilities and operations in sectoral regulations."
"When we have done this, we will be able to give inspections a higher political priority and improve enforcement of environmental laws throughout the Community."
"- (RO) Inspections represent an important element for guaranteeing application of and compliance with Community environmental legislation."
"In this sense, the Commission recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States was an important step forward when it was adopted in 2001."
"However, the evaluation of this recommendation's application has highlighted more matters for concern."
"The Commission's Communication records the fact that there are still large disparities in the way environmental inspections are being carried out at local, region and national level."
"In addition, it has been noted that the national measures adopted in the Communication's wording differ very greatly, both in terms of application and control."
"The shortcomings with this recommendation do not seem to have been remedied satisfactorily in the Commission's Communication."
"Even if this is proposed to accommodate the problems mentioned above, it is missing one key element, which has brought about modest success for the recommendation."
"I mean the very legal nature of this document."
"I believe therefore that only revising this recommendation will do no more than maintain the current state of uncertainty."
"Only a directive can bring about a significant and effective improvement for environmental inspections."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for their remarks and observations concerning environmental issues, which are so sensitive, as we are all in favour of improving the environment."
"Two remarks concerning them raised observations."
"The Commission shares the view that legally binding requirements for environmental inspections are really needed and are valuable."
"The Commission is working in that direction."
"The question is where to have those binding requirements as regards the transformation of IMPEL into a European inspection force."
"The Commission still takes the view that it is better to preserve IMPEL as it is."
"I have received one motion for a resolutionpursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."

"EU and PNR data (vote)"
"- Before the vote:"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, group chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, first of all it is not without emotion that I address you at voting time."
"I am delighted that the French Presidency has been given the opportunity to speak to the House on European PNR."
"This project raises a great many questions, fears and expectations, which all deserve close consideration."
"It involves a large number of public and private agencies and it is the internal security of the European Union, its notion of fundamental freedoms and rights and even, from certain points of view, its international policy which are at stake."
"That is why this programme needs a methodical, concerted and progressive approach."
"We have had open, well-argued debates on specific and concrete questions over the last six months."
"We have heard from companies in the air travel sector, the services in charge of security in the Member States and the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator."
"We have worked with complete transparency with the data protection authorities and, I must say, the contribution by the European Data Protection Supervisor was extremely helpful."
"The French Presidency obtained the opinion of the Agency for Fundamental Rights and this initiative was a first."
"In the same spirit of openness, the Council communicated its wish to associate very closely with this House, regardless of the legal basis or institutional framework actually in force."
"That is why we proposed to this House that views should be exchanged as frequently as possible on this programme."
"Your rapporteur also received detailed information informally at each step of the work carried out over the last six months."
"Next week the Presidency will present a written progress report to the Justice and Internal Affairs Council for approval."
"I promise the House that this summary document will be sent to you."
"The discussion between us needs to be able to cover all the important issues raised by this programme."
"They are of three orders."
"The first is that this instrument is an indispensable tool, as evidenced for example from its use in the fight against drugs."
"In France, the data programme is responsible for 60% to 80% of drugs intercepted at airports."
"One and a half tonnes of drugs a year is hardly anecdotal and what is valuable in the fight against drugs is equally valuable in the fight against terrorism."
"For the EU Anti-Terrorism Coordinator, who works in close contact with the services in charge in the Member States, the data from this programme are undeniably useful, mainly by reason of the particular vulnerability of terrorists at border crossings."
"The second important issue is that we obviously require a set of principles to protect rights and freedoms which will need to be respected throughout Europe whenever data are used."
"These data are collected and processed today using very different methods, which is unsatisfactory within the framework of the European Union."
"We need harmonised standards and whatever is useless or disproportionate must of course be discarded or sanctioned."
"Finally, the third important issue is of an international order."
"There is an interest in developing a global policy, in having an alternative model to the American model and Europe must be in a position to promote this model at international level."
"The European Union has the authority to intervene in the concerted global effort in order to influence the way in which these data and programmes are used and regulated."
"It is a question of influence; it is also a question of respect for our values."
"Our airlines and our fellow citizens are asking us to do this in order to limit the constraints caused by overly diversified national requirements."
"That, Madam President, committee chairmen, ladies and gentlemen, is what we need to reflect on together."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I will be very brief."
"I thank the Council for its statement."
"I would like to say that - on behalf of the shadows of the other groups as well - I think the European Parliament is a serious partner, fully available to give input in this process."
"However, we will only issue a formal position once there are full, satisfactory and detailed answers to all the concerns and objections that were raised on several occasions by the European Parliament, the European Data Protection Supervisor, the national data protection authorities, the fundamental rights agencies and the airlines, because I think they are entitled to a real answer."
"Council has often pledged its commitment to the reforms of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I would ask the Council, in the absence of those reforms, to act in the spirit of the Lisbon Treaty and to follow the recommendations of this House or to explain - not so much to the European Parliament but to the European citizens."
"Eight years after Nice, decision-making on these issues in the area of police and justice cooperation unfortunately still takes place behind closed doors, not subject to any meaningful democratic scrutiny."
"Therefore I wish that the Member States would show the same determination, courage and resolve to democratic reforms as they did in the financial crisis."
"Finally, I appeal to my colleagues to endorse this resolution and give a very clear political signal to the Council."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) Madam President, as Minister Jouyet is to leave us, I think that Parliament should thank him."
"He has been one of the most assiduous ministers we have known."
"I wish him good luck."
"(Loud applause)"

"(FR) Madam President, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is trying desperately to contest the competence of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on the question of equality between men and women in the workplace."
"It has seized our initiative to draft a report on the discriminatory effects of pay differentials and other inequalities on women's pensions and on the trend towards the individualisation of social security rights."
"The outcome is a hotchpotch report which strings together universally known generalities."
"We are a long way from the unequal treatment of women on pensions and the remedies on which the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality wished to predicate its report."
"As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights on the basis of Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure, I did my best, with the unanimous support of the Committee on Women's Rights, to propose specific corrections within the framework of the pension system reforms."
"There are six very precise corrections designed to plug the gaps in women's insurance as a result, for example, of maternity and their family commitments."
"Can you believe that the Committee on Employment expressly rejected them, in flagrant contradiction of its obligations under Rule 47?"
"I am sorry that we have lost a battle, but the war and our fight will continue."
"(NL) Madam President, I have voted against the Klamt report for the simple reason that the entire concept of economic immigration and what is being referred to as the 'blue card' bears witness to short-term thinking."
"We should, instead, adopt a policy of training, re-training and getting the approximately 20 million unemployed that are currently in the European Union back into jobs."
"We should, instead, learn from our past mistakes."
"A case in point is the importing of guest workers and their families in the 70s and 80s, which turned into a major social problem."
"They are now trying to appease the public by promising that this only involves highly-qualified and temporary immigrants, but who am I to doubt the words of Louis Michel, who states that other immigrants should also remain welcome."
"In other words, the floodgates remain open."
"All they are doing is creating a new one."
"This is about a coalition against society."
"Big business wants cheap labour and joins forces with the multi-cultural Left, with society left to pick up the tab."
"(FR) Madam President, I voted for the Parish report on the integration of the CMO in wine, the single CMO, with a heavy heart, because I consider that this single CMO is not a simplification and does not increase transparency."
"It will make life more complicated for wine-growers and for the entire wine industry."
"The Commissioner tried to reassure us yesterday evening."
"I hope that the Commission will keep its word and that, most importantly, the profession will continue to be adequately represented on the advisory committee, as it has been since the first CMO in wine."
"(DE) Madam President, this morning I voted with some hesitation in favour of the report by Neil Parish on the creation of a single market organisation for a wide range of different agricultural products."
"I welcome the Commission's objective of simplifying European agricultural policy."
"This means that in future there will only be one market organisation which will replace the 21 existing market organisations, for example, for fruit, vegetables, milk and wine."
"However, the administration of the resulting highly complex document must be made as simple as possible."
"For this reason, I am very pleased that the Commission gave the assurance in yesterday's debate that it will take up my idea and include in the EUR-Lex European search engine the functionality to allow users to access only the articles which relate to their specific agricultural product."
"The Commission has also confirmed that the wine market organisation, which was negotiated with some difficulty and which includes many of Parliament's requirements, will remain unchanged."
"It is only for this reason that I felt able to vote in favour of the report."
"- (SK) I am delighted that, a few days ahead of 1 December, which is recognised as World AIDS Day, we are addressing this global problem."
"The number of people infected with the HIV virus is growing."
"About 14 000 people are infected every day, and 2 000 of these are children under 15 years old."
"In addition to the usual hot-spots such as Africa and the Far East, the number of infected people has risen in Eastern Europe and in Central Asia."
"In 2006 the number of infected people in these regions rose to 1.7 million. The largest increase was recorded in Russia and Ukraine, where about 270 000 people were infected with the HIV virus."
"The spread of HIV in these areas is caused mainly through drug abuse and the use of dirty needles."
"In the case of Ukraine the figures are all the more alarming as they involve a direct neighbour of the European Union."
"The fact that we have failed to bring the HIV problem under control despite worldwide prevention programmes should lead us to reassess these programmes and to intensify efforts aimed at prevention and the production of effective cures."
"Madam President, in 1994 the West turned its head while genocide occurred in Rwanda."
"The same could now happen in eastern Congo."
"The immediate priority is humanitarian, but beyond that there is a delicate and tangled political mess to sort out."
"This is partly because the international community not only washed its hands of the genocide in Rwanda, but allowed the Hutu génocidaires to flee to eastern Congo where President Kabila did little to rein in the militias, to the disgust of Kigali and the local Tutsis."
"The UN and the AU must now take the lead in addressing the immediate political and security issues at stake, but we should also recognise that the competition for natural resources is behind funding much of this bloodshed."
"China is a serious player in the region but has little interest in the human rights of Africa."
"The Commission should examine whether a certification process for minerals and other resources could be applied now in Africa in the same way that the successful Kimberley Process has worked so well with the diamond industry over blood diamonds or conflict diamonds."
"I therefore voted in favour of this resolution."
"(FR) Madam President, this resolution is a little late coming."
"It is rather 'mustard after dinner' as, since Directive 91/414 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market was adopted, very little has been done to promote research into the effect of pesticides on bees, especially on the complete reproduction cycle of bees."
"It is all the more astonishing that, during the vote at first reading of the Breyer report on the placing of plant protection products on the market, in other words on the reform of Directive 91/414, many of those who today voted in favour of a resolution spoke out against the amendments guaranteeing better protection for bees."
"It is not good intentions that will take us forward; it is facts and acts and I trust that, when we vote on the Breyer report at second reading, my fellow Members will remember this resolution and vote in favour of the bees."
"(FR) Madam President, I should like to say to Mrs Hennicot, who only recently joined this House, that she obviously cannot know what we have been calling for since 1994, especially in this domain."
"I should like to thank all the Members who contributed to this debate and to the resolution on the alarming situation in the agricultural sector."
"There was not a crowd - nor was Mrs Hennicot here - yesterday evening towards midnight, which is understandable, to follow this excellent and very substantial debate aimed at encouraging the Commission to step up its efforts in the face of this very worrying crisis in the bee-keeping sector."
"I see with pleasure that the Commission has understood us."
"I should like to point out to the services that Amendment 1, which was adopted and which my group voted against, is a purely editorial amendment."
"There is a mistake in the German translation of my recital B)."
"We therefore need to correct this translation, which says exactly the same thing as the amendment in German."
"As regards the amendment on the authorisation of plant protection products which has since been withdrawn, I agree with its content."
"However, as it reproduces word for word the text voted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the placing of these products on the market, I and my group felt that we should not plagiarise this text and should give way to the Committee on the Environment."
"However, our recommendation and claim are extremely well formulated in paragraph 8 of the resolution, in which we call for exactly the same thing, in other words for research work on links between bee mortality and the use of pesticides to be stepped up with a view to taking appropriate measures in terms of the authorisation of these products."
"Obviously pesticides that kill bees must not be authorised."
"It is what we have been saying for years."
"Ms Lulling, thank you for your attention to the detail of this measure."
"We can assure you that the language versions will be carefully checked."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the report by my excellent friend and fellow Member Ingeborg Grassle, I voted for the legislative resolution approving, subject to amendment, the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)."
"I support better protection of the rights of persons under investigation by OLAF and reinforced cooperation with the Member States."
"There was a growing need for public governance of anti-fraud investigative activities by OLAF and independent control of the procedures and duration of enquiries, while guaranteeing the confidentiality of investigations."
"Inge Grassle has done a tremendous job of work in this report and deserves our thanks."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for Mrs Gräßle's report because anyone involved in an investigation conducted by OLAF needs to have the opportunity to make comments, at least in writing, about the matters relating to it."
"These comments should be presented to the Member States involved, along with other information obtained during the course of the investigation."
"This is the only way to present national authorities with complete information relating to the case, while also respecting the principle according to which both parties need to enjoy the opportunity to present their own point of view."
"At the same time, the report also ensures cooperation with third countries and strengthens the role of the OLAF Control Committee."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the report by Mrs Gräßle on investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)."
"It is, in fact, extremely important for us to amend the regulation on such investigations, since certain interinstitutional relations must be reviewed."
"In addition, we need to amend the regulation with regard to the rights of persons involved in investigations and with regard to the exchange of information between OLAF, European institutions, Member States and informants."
"Finally, I congratulate Mrs Gräßle on her initiative; she has produced some further interesting proposals, concerning, for example, the new role of the Director General of the Office, who would have powers to open external investigations not only at the request of a Member State or the Commission but also at the request of the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I voted in favour. The key point of this debate is not only the specific issue being tackled by the Committee on Petitions, with reference to the dissemination of German in relation to its use by Community institutions."
"First and foremost, this is a general issue of access to documents by citizens of all nationalities, and, as a result, of the transparency of the Community institutions."
"From this perspective, therefore, I believe it is absolutely vital for the Council to carry out a thorough examination of the issue with a view to promoting an increase in the number of languages used on Presidency websites."
"Such an increase could take place gradually, on the basis of appropriate, objective criteria to be defined."
"We should, however, bear in mind the fact that the greater the number of languages used, the greater the number of citizens that will be able to have a closer relationship to Europe."
"Citizens should view the European institutions in the way in which they view the buildings that house us: our institutions ought to be accessible."
"in writing. - (PT) We generally agree with the report and, in particular, with what it says about the Ombudsman's conclusions in that: 'the Council's refusal to address the substance of the complainant's request constitutes an instance of maladministration' and 'the information on these websites should, ideally, be made available in good time in all official languages of the Community'."
"However, we disagree with paragraph 1(d) of the report's conclusions, which states: 'if the number of languages is to be limited, the choice of the languages to be used must be based on criteria of objectivity, reasonableness, transparency and manageability'."
"We would argue that the Council's website should, like those of the European Parliament and the European Commission, contain all its information in all the official languages of the European Union."
"Only in this way can the multilingualism and cultural diversity supposedly defended by Community leaders, but which in practice are constantly being called into question for the sake of economising, actually be defended."
"in writing. - (PT) Although there are some contradictory aspects in the resolution adopted by a majority of this House, with the odd positive aspect, the main argument is that, because of the ageing population and demographic change, greater fragility of the universal and public social security system is justified in order to respond to the interests of the private financial sector, which wants to manage the greatest possible slice of this cake."
"Just look, for example, at the following paragraph: 'Recalls that the trend towards individualisation, contributes to the modernisation of the second and the third pillars, without calling into question the first pillar of social security systems; this to enable people, especially women and other vulnerable groups, to have more freedom of choice and thus become more independent and able to build up their own, additional pension rights'."
"In other words, in the name of freedom, the aim is to encourage people to find alternative financial solutions to public social security, even where the clearly negative results of this are well-known."
"Recent cases in the US are a perfect example of this."
"However, capitalism always tries to use propaganda to further its own aims."
"This is why we have voted against."
"in writing. - (FR) The rapporteur, Mrs Stauner, has given a lucid analysis of the challenges presented by the ageing of our populations and the decline in our active populations to our social protection systems, to which she appears to be attached."
"That is a first good point in her favour."
"A second good point is the timid question which she raises about the real efficacy of the usual panacea proposed, which is to organise the installation en masse of immigrant workers who, we hope, will pay pensions and health systems for the old Europeans, a panacea of a staggering cynicism and selfishness defended by people who often claim to have a monopoly on sympathy and tolerance."
"Finally, she earns a last good point for her critical analysis of the trend towards the privatisation of health systems and the purely financial approach to the reform of national social security systems."
"However, this report fails to address the main point: as it is the demographic decline of our continent which is at the root of these problems, that is what we need to remedy."
"The Member States can no longer avoid an ambitious family policy to encourage the birth rate to rise, as a pledge to the equilibrium of their social security systems and, more importantly, to their dynamism, prosperity and, quite simply their survival."
"in writing. - (SV) This report observes that in most Member States the population is getting older and that the social security and pension systems will therefore be put under strain."
"The solution put forward to resolve this problem is the usual one, namely various EU measures."
"The June List is of the opinion that the EU ought not to concern itself at all with matters relating to Member States' social security and pension systems."
"The European Parliament has views on the statutory pensionable age, employment contracts, what form of pension system Member States should introduce, labour taxation, sharing of the tax burden and how care should be organised in the EU countries."
"These are matters that should be dealt with entirely at national level."
"General pointers from the EU institutions on these matters contribute absolutely nothing."
"We have therefore voted against this report in the final vote."
"in writing. - (FR) Although the report by Mrs Stauner refers to the Lisbon Strategy, that patent Europeanist failure, it deserves to be supported because it questions the credo of immigration as a remedy to further deterioration in the demographic, economic and social deficits of Europe."
"Immigration, selective or otherwise, distorts the identity and culture of the people of Europe and aggravates community divisions and the tensions that derive from them, in the image of what is happening in every multi-ethnic and multicultural society in the world."
"It is neo-proslavery which only benefits the money-grubbers of globalisation, who see in this cheap labour a means of exerting pressure on wages against a background of already very high unemployment."
"It will allow the elites of third countries to be pillaged, thereby exacerbating their situation."
"It is a delusion in strategic terms, because the behaviour of immigrants will end up being modelled on that of Europeans; I am thinking here mainly of the unfortunate tendency to have fewer children in a society which is truly disorientated on all counts."
"Apart from supporting families and a higher birth rate in Europe, the new Europe of the nations needs a policy of national and Community preference, a policy of national and Community protection."
"in writing. - (EL) The report reveals the full extent of the deeply anti-grassroots aspirations of the EU and euro-unifying capital in terms of abolishing social insurance systems."
"It terrifyingly parades the pretext of demographic decline in the EU to propose an increase in the retirement age and the application of the 'three pillar' system, namely:"
"poverty-level pensions from the national social security systems;"
"the expansion of 'occupational' pension funds which provide a contribution-based pension;"
"recourse by workers to private insurance ('individualisation' in the euro-unifying terminology), the so-called 'third pillar'."
"It thereby paves a very broad way for the monopoly insurance companies to increase their profits by entering yet another profitable sector."
"This attack forms part of a bundle of EU anti-labour measures, such as the general application of 'flexicurity', the 'readjustment (that is, abolition) of labour legislation, the institutionalisation of 'slavetrading' employment agencies, the directive introducing inactive working time with a 65-hour week and the arrangement of working time on an annual basis."
"The working class must reply to the increasingly savage attack by euro-unifying capital with a counter-attack, by setting up an anti-monopoly alliance which will claim its grassroots power and lay the foundations for the satisfaction of grassroots needs and grassroots prosperity."
"in writing. - (RO) The European Union cannot have a higher employment rate as long as we have social categories which are much more weakly represented and social groups excluded from the labour market."
"People with disabilities or those with serious health problems would like to work, but most times, they are subject to serious discrimination by employers."
"In addition, special fittings are needed to ensure that these people can carry out their job properly, but employers are not prepared to invest very much in this area."
"Financial measures adopted in the Member States have not had the expected results."
"In Romania's case, I can mention the deduction, when calculating taxable profit, of sums relating to the purchase of equipment and to equipment used in the production process by a disabled person, of the transport costs for disabled people from their home to the place of work, as well as the discount from the insurance budget for unemployment of the specific costs for preparation, professional training and advice."
"Setting up certain specific enterprises, as described in the report, offers a concrete solution for including these social categories which are vulnerable in the labour market."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased with the excellent work done by Mrs Stauner on the future of social security systems and pensions and I have supported it by voting in favour."
"I endorse the reasoning on which the report is based and I believe that we, the European Union acting together with the Member States, ought to try to find an appropriate solution to the problems raised, as quickly as possible."
"Europe is a continent with an ageing population, and its mean birth rate is below the natural population replacement rate."
"In less than fifty years the population of Europe will be smaller and older."
"Immigration will certainly not be the solution to the problem: rather, there is a need to attract and retain a greater number of people in high-quality jobs, to provide a high level of social security protection and job security, to improve education and training for our work force, and to modernise the old pension systems, noting the instability linked to privately-funded systems, which are endorsed by many."
"in writing. - I fully support the introduction of the Blue Card."
"However, with the adoption of the PPE and PSE amendments, I fear that Europe's forward-looking strategy on legal migration will soon vanish into thin air."
"The current text is simply off-putting to most highly qualified workers considering legal immigration to the EU."
"Highly qualified workers will not be encouraged to work on the EU labour market, not least because of the bureaucratic obstacles that were endorsed in the current text."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted in favour of the report on conditions of entry and residence for third-country nationals for the purposes of highly-qualified employment, also known as the EU Blue Card."
"The report that was voted on in Parliament improves the directive, in particular with regard to the equal treatment of workers from third countries, as it prevents discrimination against these workers."
"It is also a positive move that Member States are to have the opportunity to investigate their own need to open the way for the immigration of workers."
"We also welcome the fact that Parliament has rejected the proposals put forward by the Commission which have allowed employers to discriminate against people for thirty years."
"It is pleasing to see that the possibility for EU Member States to take workers from sectors in third countries where there is a shortage of workers is also being restricted."
"This prevents the EU contributing to a brain drain of highly qualified workers from, in particular, the developing countries."
"At the same time, we regret the fact that Parliament was unable to agree on the issue of collective agreements also applying to workers from third countries."
"We also regret the fact that Amendment 79 was not adopted."
"Finally, the setting of pay levels is not a matter in which the EU has competence and it must ultimately be possible for this to be decided by the social partners in the respective Member States."
"We expect the Swedish Government to continue the fight in the continuing Council negotiations."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I voted in favour. This is an extremely important provision."
"The creation of new rights for highly-qualified workers from third countries represents an opportunity both for migrants and for the host countries."
"Above all, it is vital that this should take place within a framework of criteria common to all the EU Member States, to avoid any disparities and also to increase Europe's ability to attract such individuals, which still lags far behind the figures achieved by the United States and Canada."
"Within this framework of shared rules that we are preparing to adopt, I wholeheartedly support the amendments by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"A minimum wage no lower than that of a similar worker from the host country is a guarantee of equality that we consider to be vital."
"Similarly, we advocate extending the blue card to those already resident in the Member States and lengthening the extension in the event of job loss to six months."
"Finally, we have a duty to cooperate with countries outside the EU to support the training of highly-qualified staff in the key sectors that might feel the effects of the brain drain."
"The adoption of this measure will, in addition, encourage legal immigration and will enrich the EU with professional skills and human experience, within that perspective of exchange which has always constituted the true essence of the European spirit"
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the Klamt report on the introduction of a 'European Blue Card' because, for the first time, it also offers us the opportunity at European level to move from a 'no' culture, the culture of fortress Europe, to a 'yes' culture, a culture of an open Europe, so that we can at long last develop positive management of migratory movements and grant workers a certain number of rights."
"This process will need to be quickly followed by the adoption of other measures in favour of other categories of foreign workers and I shall be looking out for them."
"We could certainly have gone even further; we would have liked to see a horizontal directive rather than a sectoral directive, but the acquis is there, especially the principle of 'an equal day's pay for an equal day's work', the refusal to start a brain drain, especially in key sectors such as health and education, and the doubling of the period of residency rights for the purpose of looking for a new job once a contract of employment has ended."
"This text therefore seeks above all to promote legal immigration channels, not a form of selective immigration, to which I am opposed."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted for Mrs Klamt's report because it offers the possibility of work to immigrants with high professional qualifications."
"It stipulates in the report that EU states are obliged to give priority to European citizens, something which benefits Romanian citizens from the perspective of the restrictions applied to the labour market by a number of EU states."
"The report offers people who meet the conditions provided for by the directive the opportunity to have an EU Blue Card issued, with an initial validity of two years, which can be renewed for a further two years."
"If the employment contract lasts for a shorter period than two years, the Blue Card will be issued for the duration of the contract, plus a further three months."
"in writing. - I regrettably abstained on the vote on the report by Ewa Klamt, the proposal for a Council Directive on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment, as Ireland did not opt in to this proposal under Article 3 to the Fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty and already has an existing national policy in this area which offers flexibility and a wide degree of discretion in terms of adapting to labour market conditions."
"in writing. - (SV) Competition for ambitious, skilled workers has only just begun."
"In order to succeed in globalisation, Europe must become more attractive in the fight for the world's talent."
"The Commission's proposal for a blue card to facilitate entry into the European labour markets is therefore extremely welcome."
"I myself have long been a keen advocate of the blue card and other ideas to facilitate entry into Europe's labour market."
"Unfortunately, the proposal has been watered down so much by the majority in Parliament that I chose to abstain in the vote."
"I will continue the fight in the EU for a considerably pithier blue card than that which Parliament felt able to support."
"in writing. - (FR) The EU Blue Card, which it is claimed is reserved for highly qualified workers, offering cardholders freedom of movement and establishment in all the Member States of the European Union, will be a new suction pump for immigration which will be no more controlled at EU level than it is today in many countries at national level."
"Opening instant admission rights to family members with no real limit in time will encourage permanent populating immigration."
"It is the bureaucratic organisation of the new modern form of slavery, which from now on will choose its victims on the grounds of their diplomas, not for their muscles or their teeth."
"It will deprive developing countries of the brains which they sorely need, thereby aggravating their economic situation and guaranteeing the pursuit without end of increasing illegal immigration."
"It introduces a minimum wage threshold which is completely absurd and arbitrary, taking no account of reality or of the sectors or professions in question, with a double foreseeable consequence: a lowering of the salaries of the most highly qualified Europeans, who will be even more tempted than they are now to relocate out of Europe, and the exploitation of the immigrants, in the absence of any guarantee that they will be paid a salary which is truly commensurate with their qualifications."
"in writing. - (PT) Despite Parliament's adoption of amendments - which we voted for - which lessen some of the negative aspects of the proposal to create the 'Blue Card' in the European Union, we consider that these amendments question neither the motives nor the central objectives of the proposal for a directive presented by the European Commission to the Council."
"This 'Blue Card' is an instrument that seeks to respond to the neoliberal objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in terms of the need to exploit labour."
"In the context of capitalist competition, particularly with the US (which has the 'Green Card'), the EU is trying to entice 'highly qualified' labour, at the expense of human resources in third countries."
"In other words, this 'Blue Card' (which reduces immigration to exploitation and which discriminates between and selects immigrants according to the labour needs of the EU countries) and the 'return directive' (which will increase arbitrary expulsions and worsen the difficulties and obstacles encountered in family reunification) are different sides of the same coin."
"In other words, they are instruments (which are consistent with each other) and pillars of the same policy: the EU's inhumane immigration policy which criminalises and expels or exploits and discards immigrants."
"That is why we have voted against."
"in writing. - On behalf of ALDE I would like to state the reasons for our abstention on the final vote."
"To be clear: ALDE is a strong supporter of the Blue Card."
"However, ALDE feels that the scheme has been watered down significantly."
"Far too many restrictions have been introduced."
"The EU's immigration package is supposed to have two pillars: combating illegal immigration and creating better opportunities for legal migration at the same time."
"The proposal as amended by this House does not bring about the much needed change but confirms Member States' protectionist practices instead."
"By adopting this report, Parliament has weakened an already very modest EC proposal."
"A missed opportunity!"
"The current trend is that the vast majority of highly qualified workers migrate to the USA, Canada or Australia instead of the EU."
"If we want to reverse this trend, we have to be ambitious."
"The current text is simply off-putting to most highly qualified workers considering legal immigration to the EU and thus does not help in any way in efforts to make the EU more attractive for highly qualified workers."
"Political courage is urgently needed."
"in writing. - (FR) The interventions by Mr Jean-Pierre Jouyet, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Jacques Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission, during the debate on the EU Blue Card and the single permit which amalgamates the residence permit and work permit were highly illustrative."
"Here is a short anthology."
"To quote Jacques Barrot, 'These texts demonstrate the true scope of this Immigration and Asylum Pact which the French Presidency has brought to a successful conclusion and prove that this pact is, in fact, a balanced pact that expresses the will of Europeans to open the door to migratory movements which may be particularly useful and prove to be very positive for the future of our European society'."
"He also said, 'The possibility of being able to return to the country of origin for two years without losing the status of long-term resident is essential'."
"To quote Jean-Pierre Jouyet, 'these two texts are a beginning, not an end, and leave room for circular migration'."
"He also said, 'These two texts demonstrate that the European Union is truly committed to promoting legal immigration'."
"There can be no doubt henceforth; our leaders and our French representatives in the European institutions support mass populating immigration from outside Europe leading to national disintegration policies."
"We shall be voting against."
"in writing. - (FR) Mrs Klamt's report on the conditions of entry and residence in the European Union of third country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment starts from a correct premise but arrives at the wrong conclusions."
"It is in fact correct that qualified immigrants from outside the Community prefer to emigrate to the United States or Canada than to Europe."
"To want to reverse the trend and make them come to us smacks of a worrying masochism and loss of clear-headedness."
"Are we that incapable of training engineers, computer scientists and doctors that we need to bring them over from the developing world?"
"Is it humanely acceptable to steal the brains from countries which have an absolute need for these qualified employees in order to develop?"
"Do you believe that by favouring the selective immigration which Mr Sarkozy wants that legal and, more importantly, illegal immigration will be stopped?"
"Last question: what remains of the Community preference if we attract qualified persons by giving them the same rights as Community nationals, including the same salary rights?"
"The replies to these questions illustrate the danger of the sort of Europe that practises a real crime against humanity with regard to the developing world."
"For these reasons, we cannot vote for such a report."
"in writing. - (FR) The EU Blue Card, a real open sesame designed to generate additional qualified immigration from outside Europe, will be an economic, social and humanitarian disaster for the people and nations of Europe already suffering in the face of illegal immigration which is out of control and legal immigration which is increasing exponentially."
"In order to prevent the inevitable social dumping which the arrival of engineers or other qualified specialists from other continents would entail, their salary will need to be at least 1.7 times higher than the minimum salary in the host country."
"That will go down well with French blue collar workers."
"Immigrant workers will also be able to bring their families over under a fast-track procedure, thereby favouring family reunification, never mind how widespread and dangerous it is already."
"Moreover, immigrants will be able to accumulate periods of presence on European territory in order to obtain the status of long-term resident."
"The circle has been closed: the conditions of mass establishment and naturalisation in the Member States are in place."
"What is also scandalous is that this will aggravate the brain drain from third countries, especially Africa, by capturing their elite and guaranteeing their impoverishment once again."
"Once again the people of Europe will not be consulted on this globalist and immigrationist policy by Brussels."
"Now more than ever our fight must be that of rediscovered sovereignty and of the right of the people to stay as they are."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Klamt report, which makes the EU a more attractive destination for highly qualified workers from third countries."
"It establishes a flexible fast-track procedure for the admission of highly qualified third-country workers, including favourable residency conditions for them and their families."
"in writing. - (NL) Most people wish to continue to live and work in the environment where they grew up and whose language they speak."
"People leave their areas of origin for two important reasons."
"The first is that they run the risk of being locked up or killed."
"In order to escape that fate, they become refugees."
"The second is poverty."
"People move away to areas where the pay is higher, even if they do not receive their due pay, if their jobs are unsafe, if their housing is poor or if they have poor prospects."
"Changing expectations for future demographic developments and a shortage of people in certain jobs mean that immigration is suddenly seen as useful once more."
"Refugees who, out of sheer necessity, come to EU countries spontaneously are increasingly less welcome, whilst privileged people with high qualifications are encouraged to move here."
"This selection method means that these people with sound qualifications are taken away from the countries where they were trained, while it is exactly those countries that need them the most."
"Without them, it is difficult to catch up, which is the very reason for their poverty."
"If a blue card spawns brain drain, then this is bad news for Europe and the rest of the world."
"in writing. - (DE) The Blue Card concept in Ewa Klamt's report, which is based on a proposal by the European Commission, is an elite immigration concept which will prove to be disastrous."
"The only positive element of this is that the Blue Card concept at last represents an acknowledgement of the fact that immigration into the European Union and therefore into Germany is both necessary and right."
"The Blue Card concept will allow the EU to pick out the best of the immigrants, on the principle of keeping the good ones and discarding the rest."
"From the perspective of those of us on the left, this elite concept is not acceptable."
"People must be allowed to enter the EU to look for work and they must be given asylum when they are in trouble."
"The concept of the Blue Card will mean that highly qualified and often desperately needed workers will be attracted away from their countries of origin."
"This will increase the problems in these countries and make worldwide inequality worse."
"A study carried out by the German Institute for Employment Research indicates that the Blue Card would result in an economy in which 'above all vacant positions are filled more quickly and the wages paid to resident skilled workers are kept at a lower level'."
"The effect of this would be that in certain sectors of the economy wage levels would fall significantly."
"Overall the Blue Card concept is part of the misguided EU anti-migration policy."
"The Blue Card concept transforms people (who are immigrating) into economic factors and represents a concept of 'selective immigration'."
"in writing. - (RO) The demographic forecasts indicating that the EU's working population is going to shrink by 48 million by 2050 and that the dependency ratio is going to double, reaching 51% by 2050 highlights the fact to us that, in the future, ever-increasing numbers of immigrants with a variety of skills and qualifications will be attracted to some Member States to counterbalance these negative trends."
"The significant discrepancies with regard to the definition and admission criteria applied to highly qualified workers obviously restrict their mobility throughout the whole of the European Union, affecting the efficient redistribution of legally residing human resources and preventing regional imbalances from being eliminated."
"As a representative of a Member State which joined the European Union in 2007, I voted in favour of this report, which will regulate effectively current and future requirements for highly qualified labour, taking into account the principle of Community preference applied to EU citizens."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am totally opposed to the report by Mrs Klamt on the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of highly qualified employment."
"The so-called 'blue card', a sort of crude copy of the US green card, would only be detrimental to the current state of the European social system, and the job insecurity and unemployment which torment our highly qualified personnel."
"I am strongly opposed to this proposal, which would mean that our highly qualified workers would have to compete with non-Europeans and, what is more, probably at a disadvantage."
"It would also help to mop up skills and potential in the non-EU countries themselves, encouraging that very brain drain that we are currently seeking to combat in Europe."
"in writing. - (SV) Positive aspects of the report are lawful immigration and the fact that employers who break the rules can be excluded from the procurement of EU aid, but, unfortunately, the European Parliament has weakened the protection of workers and, in practice, the pay requirements only give high-salaried workers such as engineers and doctors access to the system."
"The brain drain problem could also have been dealt with better and therefore I am abstaining from the vote, despite the positive aspects."
"in writing. - (SV) The blue card is basically a very good idea and I have always advocated making lawful immigration easier and unlawful immigration more difficult."
"Unfortunately, the original proposal has now been watered down so much and has become so bureaucratic that, in line with my political group, I choose to abstain."
"in writing. - (NL) The blue card seemed like a good start to streamlined migration policy in the European Union."
"European migration policy is necessary, to my mind, not least because, by 2050, the European working population will have dwindled by 20 million people."
"The Commission proposal, which was insubstantial to start with, has, however, been pared down considerably by the European Parliament."
"The Commission proposal left some room for migration of people without a higher qualification but with strong skills."
"Parliament, however, nipped this proposal in the bud by tightening up the conditions for migration considerably."
"The income threshold was set by the European Parliament at 1.7 times the average wage of the Member State."
"This is far too high."
"If we want to compete with the US and Canada, the countries that attract the most highly qualified, then we will have to simplify the rules for people to come and work here."
"Moreover, Parliament's requirement that immigrants must have five years' working experience, including two years in a 'senior position', is unacceptable."
"It is beyond me why this proposal has not been expanded into a migration procedure for everyone who can find a job here."
"The blue card will make legal migration possible, but because this certainly does not apply to everyone, I have abstained."
"in writing. - (PL) The European Union must face up to the issue of economic migration."
"Unfortunately, compared with the United States, Canada and Australia, it is not seen as an attractive destination by migrating skilled workers."
"The main causes of this situation are the lack of a uniform migrant reception system and problems associated with movement between EU states."
"To change this state of affairs, we need an integrated and consistent European migration policy."
"We must not forget that by attracting skilled specialists the European Union will gain - will increase - its competitiveness and will have the chance of economic growth."
"It is predicted that in the next two decades the EU will find itself short of 20 million skilled workers, mainly engineers."
"We must not dismiss these predictions."
"It is my view that employing migrants can in no circumstances be a long-term solution to the European Union's economic problems."
"The EU should take further action in terms of economic and employment policy, though at the present time it needs economic migrants, if only because of the ageing of its population and increasing demographic changes."
"In view of the above, I have supported the introduction of a European Blue Card scheme for skilled migrants."
"in writing. - (FR) On the basis of the report by my fellow Member Patrick Gaubert, I voted for a legislative resolution approving, subject to amendment, the proposal for a Council directive on a single application procedure for a single permit for third country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State."
"I should like to welcome the important work done by Patrick Gaubert on such a sensitive subject, which is designed to contribute towards efforts to develop a global European immigration policy."
"Working on a common set of rights for third-country nationals already legally resident in a Member State and on a procedural aspect, namely the granting of a single permit at the end of a single application procedure, had become the logical thing to do."
"in writing. - I felt obliged to abstain on the vote on the report by Patrick Gaubert on the proposal for a Council directive on a single application procedure for a single permit for third-country nationals to reside and work in the territory of a Member State and on a common set of rights for third-country workers legally residing in a Member State."
"I did so because regrettably Ireland did not opt in to this proposal under Article 3 to the Fourth Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Demographic forecasts and the current economic situation prove that an effective immigration policy is needed in Europe so that our labour force requirements are regulated appropriately."
"In the coming decades Europe's economic and social development will depend on an influx of new economic migrants."
"This means that we need active Europe-wide policies for admitting both highly-skilled workers and less-skilled workers."
"in writing. - (FR) The European Parliament has just adopted by a very large majority two reports on the admission of migrant workers into Europe, thereby demonstrating the real capacity of the European Union to introduce specific instruments for the concerted management of economic migrants."
"The adoption of my report on the single procedure for granting a residence permit and a work permit formally refutes the unfounded accusations of a number of heads of state of Africa and Latin America about a 'fortress Europe' which is closed in on itself."
"This vote in plenary affirms the principle of equal treatment of legal immigrants with European citizens and grants them a set of social and economic rights."
"These decisions will help to improve their integration; migrant workers do not represent a danger to our job markets."
"The report on the EU Blue Card will in fact allow graduates and highly qualified immigrants to access the job markets of the countries of the European Union more easily, thanks to more attractive reception conditions."
"Europe has demonstrated that it is capable of adopting a dignified, solid and open immigration policy."
"in writing. - (FR) Mr Gaubert wishes to send out a message that Europe is open to legal immigration by granting legal immigrants all sorts of rights and restricting the facility for Member States to limit the overall equality of treatment between European nationals and immigrants in the Member States, in other words by introducing a European obligation to engage in positive discrimination."
"Let Mr Gaubert be assured: it is a well-known fact in every emigration country that Europe is like a sieve."
"Hundreds of thousands of legal and illegal immigrants enter it every year, attracted not by the prospect of work (in France, only 7% of legal immigrants come for work), but by the still too numerous social benefits and other rights offered to and sometimes reserved for them, without anything being demanded of them or with no facility to demand anything of them in return, not even a minimal knowledge of the language of the host country, to go by what Mr Gaubert says."
"At a time when our countries are entering a recession, when our economic and social models have been undermined by globalisation, when the number of unemployed and poor European workers has exploded, we urgently need, on the contrary, to demand the application of the principle of national and Community preference in all sectors."
"in writing. - (PT) As with the EP's opinion on the 'Blue Card', despite Parliament's adoption of amendments - which we voted for - which lessen some of the negative aspects of the proposal to set up a 'single application procedure' for a permit for an immigrant to reside and work in a European Union country, we consider that these amendments question neither the motives nor the central objectives of the proposal for a directive presented by the European Commission to the Council."
"As underlined by our parliamentary group, the aim of the 'single application procedure' is to harmonise procedures and immigrants' rights; in certain fundamental aspects, however, it will restrict these rather than reinforce them."
"For example, this is the case with making immigration dependent on the a priori existence of a work contract and not making the conditions for immigrants in general equivalent to those laid down for the 'Blue Card'."
"In other words, this 'single application procedure' and the 'return directive' (which will increase arbitrary expulsions and worsen the difficulties and obstacles encountered in family reunification) are different sides of the same coin."
"In other words, they are instruments (which are consistent with each other) and pillars of the same policy: the EU's inhumane immigration policy which criminalises and expels or exploits and discards immigrants."
"That is why we have voted against."
"in writing. - I support workers' rights, which is why I voted in favour of this report."
"This should provide workers in third countries with a much simpler system for a single work and residence permit."
"in writing. - (SV) I am abstaining because a 'no' could be interpreted as indicating that I am against immigration, which is not the case, but the report is problematic because a common procedure means that the EU will have power over immigration policy, which means there is a danger of it being bad."
"in writing. - (SV) I am choosing to vote against the amendment, not because I think it is bad in itself, but because I want to wait for the larger and more well thought-out directive that is being prepared by the Commission."
"It is important for us not to rush through legislative proposals within such an important area as this."
"in writing. - (PT) The main issue in relation to wine is the content of the recently adopted CMO which, in our opinion, includes some very negative aspects, particularly for Portuguese production, which is fundamentally based on small and medium-sized agricultural holdings."
"Its practical effects are already starting to be felt, as reported to me by many farmers with whom I have been in contact."
"However, there do not seem to be any great difficulties with the inclusion of the wine sector in a single CMO which will bring together all the market regulation instruments, which may or may not be common to the various sectors."
"It may be purely a question of simplification, provided that this does not mean the elimination of instruments or have any other legal meanings."
"As the problem with regard to wine lies in the reform already approved and carried out, albeit with our opposition, it is now somewhat irrelevant whether this sector is included in a single CMO or not, as this does not alter the practical effects."
"That is why we decided to abstain."
"in writing. - (SV) The June List thinks that it is a good thing for the current 21 regulations on the sector-specific organisation of the market to be revised and consolidated in one regulation in order to streamline and simplify the legislation."
"However, as the Commission observes, the fundamental policy has not changed."
"The June List has therefore voted against this report, as we do not support the current common agricultural policy."
"in writing. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I have only voted in favour of the Commission proposal to integrate the wine CMO into the single CMO with all the other agricultural products because the Commission assured us in yesterday's debate that, as soon as the Council's proposal is accepted, it will include the functionality in the EUR-Lex search engine to allow users of the individual CMOs, for example for wine, milk or fruit and vegetables, to access only the articles related to their specific product."
"In addition, the Commission has also guaranteed that future changes will only be made to individual products and other products will not be arbitrarily changed at the same time."
"The discussion has made it clear that, in future, although there will only be one document instead of 21, this one document will be just as extensive as the 21 individual documents."
"However, the administration of the resulting highly complex document for the single CMO must be made as simple as possible."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of the amendment to the EU regulation on establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments."
"This means that the financial aid ceiling has increased from EUR 12 to 25 billion for EU Member States which are not part of the euro zone and are experiencing difficulties with their balance of payments."
"The European Parliament believes that Member States which do not belong to the euro zone should be encouraged to look at obtaining, within the Community, possible medium-term financial support to be able to cope with their balance deficit before requesting aid at an international level."
"The current situation provides additional proof of the euro's usefulness in terms of protecting Member States which belong to the euro zone and invites Member States which do not belong to the euro zone to join it immediately, thereby meeting the Maastricht criteria."
"in writing. - The current financial situation demonstrates the protective effect of the euro, and we should do all that we can to encourage all non-Eurozone Member States to adopt the euro as soon as they meet the criteria."
"It is also my view that non-Eurozone EU countries which need financial support should first look to the EU before approaching international bodies."
"It is for these reasons that I supported this report."
"The June List believes that it is very important for Member States in the European area to be in a good economic position and is in favour of an independent European neighbourhood policy."
"However, we believe that a common European aid system for medium-term financial assistance provides neither a guarantor nor a solution for that not being the case."
"Such a system creates an unnecessary and bureaucratic procedure in which those Member States requiring help in reality become dependent on EMU countries with outsider-imposed requirements for 'political and economic measures'."
"Countries that are members of the European Union - as they should be - but are not members of the monetary union - as they should not be - are forced to keep a fixed exchange rate with the euro and thus with their most important trading partners."
"We therefore believe that it is unsound for countries that are not members of the monetary union to choose to fix their exchange rate and then need to be rescued by large regional and/or international bodies."
"The June List is therefore of the opinion that the appropriation of EUR 25 million to support Member States' balances of payments is unnecessary."
"We believe instead that those countries that are members of the EU but have not joined the monetary union should maintain a regime with a floating exchange rate."
"This type of problem will then disappear and taxpayers will save EUR 25 million."
"in writing. - (PT) It is undeniable that both terrorism and organised crime are terrible threats that must be combated with instruments that are as effective as possible."
"It is also important to avoid each Member State creating its own PNR data system."
"At the moment there are three Member States that have done this, resulting in various differences between them in relation to both the obligations imposed on carriers and their objectives."
"However, a basic rule of data protection is that any new instrument should only be adopted where the need to transfer this personal data and the specific aims of this transfer have been clearly proven."
"The proposal presented to us by the Commission is too vague and does not clarify the added value that collecting PNR data will bring, nor what the relationship will be with existing measures for controlling entry into the EU for security purposes, such as the SIS (Schengen Information System), VIS (Visa Information System) and API (Advance Passenger Information) system."
"I believe it is vital, before we take any final decisions, to clearly demonstrate the usefulness of this data and the specific aims which it is intended to address, ensuring that the principle of proportionality is respected and that appropriate legal safeguards are created."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the use of Passenger Name Records (PNR) for law enforcement purposes."
"I did so as any proposal in this area must be proportionate and in compliance with the European Court of Human Rights and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Commission's proposal could have a considerable impact on the personal life of European citizens and it has failed to provide sufficient evidence that the mass collection of data is needed at the EU level."
"in writing. - (SV) The Commission wishes to collect and exchange passenger information at EU level in order to combat crime and terrorism."
"Included in the information that is to be collected and made available to crime prevention authorities are aircraft passengers' credit card numbers, plane seating requests, contact details, baggage information, frequent flyer information, language skills and the age, name and contact details of any person accompanying a child on a journey as well as that person's relationship to the child."
"This type of mass recording will undoubtedly result in the infringement of privacy."
"The proposal does not take account of the often lauded but seldom applied principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"We welcome the fact that the European Parliament is critical towards the Commission's proposal and would like to point out that it is doubtful whether this type of EU legislation is required."
"We have therefore voted in favour of the European Parliament's resolution, as it disassociates itself from the measures proposed by the Commission."
"in writing. - (PT) Although we disagree with certain aspects of this resolution, particularly its failure to demarcate the 'fight against terrorism', we consider that it reaffirms some serious reservations about the creation of a PNR data system (covering passengers of air carriers) within the EU."
"Among other aspects, the resolution:"
"regrets that the justification of the proposal to set up a PNR data system in the EU has left so many legal uncertainties with respect to compatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR);"
"believes that the aim is not harmonisation of national systems (given that these do not exist), but rather the obligation to set these up;"
"expresses concern that, in essence, the proposal gives law enforcement authorities access to all data without a warrant;"
"reiterates the concerns regarding the measures outlining an indiscriminate use of PNR data for profiling and for the definition of risk assessment parameters;"
"highlights that the information so far provided by the US has never conclusively proven that the massive and systematic use of PNR data is necessary in the 'fight against terrorism'."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs in 't Veld, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) for law enforcement purposes."
"I fully share the aims and concerns raised by my fellow Member, both in relation to the proportionality of the measures proposed by the Commission, and in relation to the legal basis of such a provision and the dangers, which I raised on various occasions during meetings of the Civil Liberties Committee, for personal data protection."
"The need to guarantee a high level of security to citizens is sacrosanct, and it seems to me that currently there are many systems in force."
"I believe that before introducing further measures we need to evaluate the full, systematic implementation of existing mechanisms, to avoid the risk of creating greater problems than those we are seeking to overcome."
"in writing. - Paragraph 2 of this resolution deals with membership of the Eurozone."
"In line with the convention of the UK Conservative Delegation on issues relating to the euro, we have abstained on the final vote."
"in writing. - (IT) I voted for this resolution, but I would have preferred the text to have been adopted with Amendment 1, paragraph 19, which was unfortunately rejected by a few votes."
"That amendment would have made our specific commitment in this extremely delicate and crucial area even more valid."
"Nonetheless, I hope that the adoption of this resolution will lead to intervention on the ground by the European Union."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the EU response to the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo as I feel that what is happening is very worrying, given the millions of deaths, hundred of thousands of refugees and heinous crimes against those who are totally defenceless."
"There is also potential for the conflict to spread to neighbouring countries."
"This motion for a resolution is along the right lines, particularly as it calls for the perpetrators of these crimes against humanity to be brought to justice and for efforts to be made to strengthen and comply with existing agreements, either by giving MONUC more resources or by applying international pressure on those involved."
"I also want to highlight the call for the European Union to prevent European companies from exploiting minerals originating from that area, as the sale of these funds the conflict."
"We must do everything in our power to prevent another tragedy in Africa."
"in writing. - (SV) The situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo is dreadful."
"We wholeheartedly support international solutions, which ought to be implemented within the framework of UN cooperation."
"However, we do not believe that the EU should use international crises and conflicts to strengthen its foreign policy."
"We have therefore voted against this resolution."
"in writing. - (EL) The ΕU as a whole, just like strong individual Member States, must take a serious share of responsibility for the deterioration in the already tragic situation of the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as a result of the civil war, and of all the nations of the African continent."
"The systematic, long-standing plundering of the wealth of this specific country and of Africa in general by European colonialists in the past and imperialists today and the fomentation or exploitation of civil conflicts in order to impose their interests, have resulted in a situation where Africa is the richest continent in the world with the most hungry, poor and downtrodden inhabitants."
"The proposed strengthening of the various forms of interventionist activity by the EU, mainly through the military strength of the UN, without excluding simultaneous political or other activity by the country in question, has absolutely nothing to do with the alleged humanitarian protection of its population, as hypocritically stated in the joint resolution by the Liberals, Social Democrats and Greens."
"The humanitarian interest is the pretext."
"The basic objective is for the countries of the EU to secure a greater market share, which is of course connected - as the resolution indirectly admits - with the unimpeded and continuing overall plundering of the rich mineral wealth of the country."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats believe that space should not be militarised and are of the opinion that research and investments should focus exclusively on peaceful aims."
"However, we cannot support Amendment 6, which rejects all indirect military use, as a large number of applications, such as satellite navigation and communications services, are also used in peace-keeping efforts, which in some cases are military in nature."
"This technology is also very useful to civil society and we do not believe that civil use should be restricted because it also has military uses."
"in writing. - While I support the thrust of this resolution, I and my British Conservative colleagues are wholly opposed to the Treaty of Lisbon and cannot therefore support the reference to it in Paragraph One."
"in writing. - I supported this resolution on 'how to bring space down to earth' as I believe we should support a European space policy."
"In Ireland decreasing numbers of young people are choosing science as a career option - a trend that is repeated across Europe."
"Space exploration is inspiring for young people and encourages them to choose a career in science and technology; it also strengthens research capabilities in Europe."
"However, I am of the view that the use of space must serve exclusively non-military purposes and we should reject any direct or indirect military use of systems such as Galileo."
"in writing. - (PT) Among the important issues and priorities highlighted by this European Parliament resolution on the European space policy, this brief explanation of vote is intended to denounce the fact that a majority in this House advocates the use of space for military purposes."
"This is the conclusion that can be drawn from the rejection of the proposed amendments tabled by our parliamentary group which reiterated that outer space must be used for exclusively peaceful purposes and that outer space must be used for exclusively non-military purposes, thereby rejecting any direct or indirect military use."
"By contrast, a majority in Parliament considers that there is a 'growing interest in a strong and leading role for the EU in a European space policy (ESP) in order to foster solutions in the field of the environment, transport, research, defence and security.'"
"In this respect, a majority in Parliament calls on the Council and the Commission 'to encourage synergies between civilian and security developments in the field of space; points out that the European security and defence capabilities depend among other things on the availability of satellite-based systems'."
"In other words, space can be used in the militarisation of the EU and in the arms race."
"in writing. - (FR) I am truly sorry that the excellent proposal for a resolution on the future of European space policy, which has just been passed, makes no reference to the Kourou space centre."
"The space history of Europe inevitably passes via Guyana."
"It is so obvious to everyone that we no longer think of pointing out that all the Ariane rockets are assembled there and are launched from this launch pad."
"My thanks to the French Presidency, represented by Mr Jean-Pierre Jouyet, who had the presence of mind to mention it during yesterday's debate."
"To my mind, European space strategy must without fail incorporate proper consideration of future developments of the European Spaceport, both in terms of infrastructure and staff and in terms of research projects."
"The Kourou site is the window of the European space programme."
"Guyana, which is an outermost region of the European Union, deserves to be recognised for its past and future contribution to this strategic policy."
"I would have liked to see this House pay homage to the Guyana space centre and explicitly express the pride which it inspires in all Europeans."
"In just a few decades, Kourou has become a major constituent element of our European identity."
"in writing. - (PT) The Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) adopted by 107 countries in 2008 will be open for signature as from 3 December and will enter into force once 30 ratifications have been secured."
"The Convention will prohibit the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions as an entire category of weapons and States Parties will be required to destroy stockpiles of such munitions."
"This motion for a resolution, which we support, calls on all states to sign and ratify the CCM at the earliest opportunity and to take steps at national level to begin implementing the CCM even before it is ratified."
"The motion for a resolution calls on all states not to use, invest in, stockpile, produce, transfer or export cluster munitions until the CCM has entered into force."
"It also calls on all the EU Member States to provide assistance to affected populations and to support the clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants."
"Finally, it calls on all the EU Member States not to take any action which might circumvent or jeopardise the CCM and its provisions, in particular through a possible Protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons which might allow the use of cluster munitions."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the need to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions by the end of 2008."
"This proposal, which I fully endorse, will prohibit the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions as an entire category of weapons."
"I also approve of the fact that it will be compulsory for EU Member States which have used cluster munitions to provide technical and financial assistance for the clearance and destruction of cluster munitions remnants."
"Finally, I welcome the initiative of my fellow Members calling upon all the Member States not to use, invest in, stockpile, produce, transfer or export cluster munitions, independently of the convention's ratification."
"in writing. - The British Conservative Delegation voted for this resolution as a straightforward endorsement of the recently negotiated UN Convention on Cluster Munitions."
"We believe that the Convention has successfully combined principled and practical humanitarianism with appreciation of the military requirements of responsible armed forces."
"We have consistently held the view that an indiscriminate ban on the use of all types of cluster munition would negatively affect the operational effectiveness of our armed forces."
"We therefore draw special attention to the clearly defined exemption in the Convention for the next generation of ""smarter” munitions which are designed to self destruct and present a minimal risk to civilians."
"The British Ministry of Defence is currently developing a munition that falls within the terms of this exemption."
"In general, we believe it is important to maintain a sense of proportion in relation to risk management by our armed forces."
"While the British Armed Forces always seek to minimise harm to the civil population and limit collateral damage we should never lose sight of the fact that we are fighting terrorist and insurgent elements totally without scruples in the methods they employ for the indiscriminate destruction of innocent human life."
"It is these elements that should be the target of our ire."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for this motion for a resolution."
"Early diagnosis and research provide a solid foundation for health protection."
"In the case of HIV, results from recent years demonstrate how important it is to encourage research."
"From this perspective, therefore, we need to remove obstacles of any kind to research, which for those affected by HIV represents a real hope of being able to lead a qualitatively more satisfying life."
"This requirement should be supported in concrete terms through the use by the Commission of political, economic and financial resources."
"At the same time, the Council and the Commission ought to ensure that discrimination against those affected by HIV is declared illegal in all EU Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) The MEPs elected by the Portuguese PSD (Social Democratic Party) support the resolution which encourages the promotion of early diagnosis and care of HIV infections in each of the Member States."
"The most recent statistics still indicate not only an increase within the EU of the number of new HIV infections, but also a large proportion of HIV infections which are still undiagnosed."
"One of the reasons for the rapid spread of HIV infection in many EU countries is the fact that many intravenous drug users are infected and spread the disease by sharing needles."
"The annual report of EuroHIV on trends in drug consumption in the European Union puts Portugal as the country with the highest number of detected cases of HIV/AIDS among drug users."
"The annual survey of healthcare, the Euro Health Consumer Index (EHCI) 2008, reports that Portugal is towards the bottom of the ranking of healthcare systems in Europe."
"One of the criticisms levelled at the Portuguese health system is that it has still not solved its problem of access to treatment and waiting times."
"Eurostat still indicates Portugal as being the country with the highest AIDS-related death rate."
"The comparative analysis of data from Portugal and from its EU partners reveals that something is wrong with our national strategy."
"We must identify and analyse what is going wrong."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on early diagnosis and care of HIV/AIDS as, in my opinion, we urgently need to reinforce the measures and actions for diagnosing and treating this disease, given the alarming rise in the number of new HIV infections in the European Union."
"Actions to prevent and treat the disease are vital in order to stem the growing tide of infections."
"I therefore feel it is essential to promote easier access to information, advice, healthcare provision and social services."
"Moreover, it is vital that the Member States enact provisions which effectively outlaw discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, including restrictions that impact on their freedom of movement within their jurisdictions."
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to say that I voted for the motion for a resolution on early diagnosis and early care with regard to the HIV virus."
"In order to protect European citizens and their health, the Commission has an obligation to promote early diagnosis and to reduce the barriers to testing for this disease, as well as to provide early care and to communicate the benefits of early care."
"In view of the fact that the EuroHIV and UNAIDS reports confirm that the number of new cases of HIV is increasing at an alarming rate within the European Union and in neighbouring countries and that in some countries the number of people estimated to be infected with HIV is almost three times the official figures, I welcome the proposal, which also calls upon the Commission to establish an HIV/AIDS reduction strategy focused on drug addicts and intravenous drug users."
"in writing. - (PT) We want to highlight some of the aspects of this resolution with which we agree, in particular: 'unfair competition from products originating in third countries and imported into the Community market' and the 'serious threat of a decline in bee colonies due to the significant reduction in the supply of pollen and nectar'."
"These problems must be solved by applying Community preference and tackling unfair competition from apiculture products originating in third countries."
"Research into parasites and diseases - which are decimating the bee population - and their origins, including the responsibility of GMOs, should be immediately stepped up by making additional budgetary resources available for this research."
"The one aspect missing from the resolution is the responsibility of the common agricultural policy reforms for this whole problem."
"Rural desertification, dismantling of production over vast areas and introduction of genetically modified species have led to a loss of biodiversity."
"Similarly, production methods which ignore the specific soil and climate conditions of each region have been promoted."
"An agricultural policy which reversed this trend, in addition to the measures indicated above, would significantly help to solve the problems in the beekeeping sector."
"in writing. - (SV) This resolution deals with the fact that bee populations are dying of unexplained causes."
"We share the view that research is needed to get to grips with this problem."
"However, we do not share the view that it is necessary to give more subsidies to beekeepers and to provide more protection against the surrounding world (protectionism)."
"in writing. - (SV) The proposal submitted by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has some good and some not so good aspects."
"We are in favour of the Commission initiating research on parasites and diseases that are decimating bee populations."
"However, the resolution also contains proposals that we are unable to support."
"For example, the European Parliament 'urges the Commission to propose a financial aid mechanism for apiaries which are in difficulties due to bee mortality' (paragraph 11)."
"We cannot support any such costs to the EU's budget and the European Parliament's federalist majority ought not to express their support for this without acknowledging the financial consequences of such a position."
"We have therefore voted against this resolution in its entirety."
"in writing. - (RO) The dramatic reduction in the bee population and, by implication, in pollenisation is jeopardising the production of fruit, vegetables and crops in the European Union."
"The drop in the number of bees is due to both different parasites and mycoses found in the atmosphere and spraying pesticides."
"The main problem is the infection caused by the varroa parasite, which is manifested by deformities at the level of the wings and abdomen, and underdeveloped bees unable to fly and with a very short lifespan."
"If left untreated, varroa may lead to the disappearance of a whole colony of bees in a few months."
"The prolonged use of pesticides has also resulted in the reduction of the bee population, even when they were used to destroy mycoses and parasites."
"Certain scientists believe that another cause for this phenomenon is the electromagnetic wave radiation emitted from mobile phones, which penetrates the bees' navigation system, leaving them unable to return to the hive."
"Research in this field will need to be developed in order to find solutions to combating the diseases which affect bees."
"Furthermore, efforts made by farmers to reduce the number of times plant protection products are applied during blossoming will also help to halt the decline of these insects."
"in writing. - (DA) On behalf of Ole Christensen, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Dan Jørgensen, Britta Thomsen and Christel Schaldemose."
"The Danish delegation of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has voted against the resolution concerning the situation in the beekeeping sector."
"It is our view that the resolution bears the hallmarks of protectionism and an attempt to establish more subsidy schemes for the EU's farmers."
"We are of the opinion that bee mortality is a huge problem that should be dealt with at EU level, but using the right mechanisms."
"This will entail, for example, additional research and a focus on the protection of our ecosystems, including restricting the use of pesticides."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the review of Recommendation 2001/331/EC providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections in the Member States."
"Good and even enforcement of Community environmental law is essential and anything less falls short of public expectations and undermines the reputation of the Community as an effective guardian of the environment."
"If our legislation is to have any credibility it needs to be enforced effectively."
"in writing. - (PT) Without doubt, we need to pay more attention to environmental issues and we need to adopt measures to prevent the constant environmental damage which is compromising the present and future of our planet and the quality of life of our citizens."
"We must therefore be more alert to compliance with rules ensuring respect for the environment and taking into account the specific conditions of each country, including the social implications."
"We also need a policy with more solidarity that takes account of different levels of development and economic capability."
"Not all these aspects are duly safeguarded in the EU's environmental law, nor are its policies duly consistent."
"We therefore have grave doubts about the political will of the European Commission to solve this complex problem and we run the risk of worsening regional and social inequalities with some of the proposals put forward in this resolution."
"That is why we decided to abstain."
"in writing. - (PT) I congratulate my colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their wording of both the oral question and the motion for a resolution, because they clearly indicate the need to correctly implement Community environmental law."
"In this respect they urge the Commission to come forward with a proposal for a directive on environmental inspections, clarifying the definitions and criteria and extending the scope."
"Both documents also underline the need to strengthen the European Union Network for the Implementation and Enforcement of Environmental Law (IMPEL) and to support environmental education and information provision, the specific content of which must be determined at local, regional or national level on the basis of the needs and problems identified in a given area."
"If the EU is not strict in enforcing its environmental policy, public expectations will be frustrated and the EU's role as an effective guardian of the environment will be undermined."
"in writing. - (EL) We voted against the motion for a resolution which supports the position that the proper and equal application of Community environmental legislation is vital, because this legislation does not protect the environment; it protects the vital interests of the EU monopolies."
"The call for the adoption of a Community body of environmental inspectors constitutes direct intervention in the internal affairs of the Member States in order to secure the application of the 'polluter pays' principle, which permits the destruction of the environment in return for payment of a cheap consideration, the 'green taxation' which the grassroots classes have to shoulder, emissions trading, the promotion of entrepreneurship and competitiveness as the determining criteria for the development of what are otherwise innovative 'environmental' technologies, the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture and the abolition in practice of the principles of precaution and prevention."
"The EU and its environmental policy, which serve the interests of big business, breed food crimes, the atmospheric pollution of city centres with 'modern pollutants', the destruction of forests, soil corrosion and desertification and the pollution of seas and waters."
"The environment will constitute a business sector with the objective of maximising the profits of the economic oligarchy."
"It will suffer the consequences of the unthinking and unaccountable exploitation of natural resources and it will be spoiled by capitalist barbarity."

"Somalia"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Somalia."
"author. - Mr President, Somalia is a country whose citizens live in very dire and chaotic circumstances, fraught with dangers to their well-being and to their very existence."
"This House - and indeed the international community in general - time and again have dealt with the unacceptable situation in that country."
"Both the EU and the UN and other foreign agencies have given - and continue to give - much financial and other support to the Somalian people."
"But to add to the country's grave state of affairs came the involvement of the so-called Islamic courts."
"These are in effect a manifestation of the practice by criminal and evil people of exercising terror on fellow citizens by using religion - in this case Islam - as an excuse."
"The recent execution by stoning to death of the 13-year-old girl victim of rape, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, is another example of this practice."
"But the most recent worrying phenomenon in the gradually disintegrating society of Somalia is not just the barbaric extent of such acts of atrocity but also the fact that such a despicable act was carried out by a group of 50 men and was watched by about a thousand spectators."
"Such a gruesome performance of sadistic behaviour is easy to condemn but hard to understand using humanly accepted parameters of societal psychology."
"The Government of Somalia, aided by the international community and the African Union, must forthwith demolish the devilish Islamic courts and those that support or propagate their practice in the country."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I want to express our total condemnation of the murders being committed in this region of Somalia in the name of God."
"Few atrocities have been committed by someone who has not invoked the name of God or a religion."
"I must particularly condemn the way in which this atrocious murder was committed: a 13-year-old girl was raped, she was then accused of adultery and then five men - if we can call them men - hurried to stone her to death, even preventing someone from trying to save her, in a stadium with around 1 000 spectators."
"This event, combined with the acts of piracy which so far this year have involved almost 100 boats being hijacked along the coast of Somalia, constitutes a wholly unacceptable humanitarian situation."
"The international community cannot remain impassive."
"It must not remain impassive in the face of cowardice and the use of religion to justify the commission of atrocities."
"We therefore have to re-establish order, by supporting the legitimate government of Somalia so that it can take back control of the whole country and establish a rule of law which respects human rights."
"I believe that there have been few occasions when we have been presented with such a clear situation which requires us to act."
"I believe that we cannot remain impassive here in this Community of 500 million people and 27 countries, the most important in the world."
"We must intervene."
"I do not know how we can do this, but I believe that we must, and quickly."
"The Socialist Group does not agree with the amendments tabled at the last moment, which have not been duly negotiated."
"We support the text of the joint motion for a resolution and hope that this will mark the start of the European Union's serious concern about this type of humanitarian issue and its condemnation of the misuse of religious concepts to commit atrocities in the name of God."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, I have participated in dozens of human rights debates in this Chamber, but I am perhaps especially moved today, because in fact when we speak of large numbers, of thousands of dead, it gradually stops making an impression."
"However, when we look at the murder of one specific person, of a child in fact, a thirteen-year-old girl called Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, then indeed the cruelty of the act forces us to think about what we can do."
"In fact of course, what is happening in Somalia is not restricted to just this one horrifying, cruel murder enshrined in the majesty of the local Islamic religious law."
"It also includes - and this is worth mentioning, and has not been mentioned by previous speakers - suicide bombings which have recently killed thirty people."
"It includes public floggings carried out in the country's capital to demonstrate the power of radical Islamists."
"It includes many human rights violations."
"It also includes - although this is mentioned less often and should be emphasised - the recent abduction of two Italian Catholic nuns from Kenya, who are now being held in Somalia."
"In summary, we must today say a resounding 'No!'"
"author. - Mr President, every Thursday afternoon during our plenary sessions in Strasbourg we learn of yet new tragedies, vile crimes, atrocities and grave injustices."
"The competition for the three places allocated to urgency debates is the best indication of man's continued inhumanity to man."
"Against this dismal backdrop it is hard to imagine that any case could still manage to shock us."
"We may say we have heard it all."
"Yet every once in a while we deal with a case so utterly repugnant that we are proved wrong."
"The stoning to death of a 13-year-old girl child in Somalia is just such a case: first the victim of a mass rape, subsequently found guilty of adultery while the perpetrators of the rape go free, and finally sentenced to the most horrible of deaths."
"As colleagues have already mentioned, 50 men stoned her to death, with a crowd of a thousand bystanders watching the horror unfold."
"To their credit, some of the gathered crowd tried to save the petrified child."
"However, militia opened fire on those who had the decency to try to protect this victim of an inhuman and bigoted practice."
"One young boy paid with his life, the victim of militia gunshots."
"In the face of this horrific crime, what can we possibly do to right the wrong?"
"We must give every support to the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, as only by reasserting some control and rule of law in areas of the country controlled by the radical opposition groups can there be any prospect of avoiding a repetition of this and other atrocities."
"The Somali Government should restore the honour of the victim, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, posthumously."
"This Chamber expresses its sincere condolences to Aisha's family."
"It was I that proposed Aisha's case be placed on today's agenda."
"Thank you for supporting that request."
"May we never have to debate a similar instance in this Chamber again."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, we are today discussing an event in Somalia which is beyond the imagination of the average European."
"The first impulse that comes to mind on hearing about it is a refusal to accept it."
"You simply do not want to believe that such a thing is possible at all."
"Nevertheless, we should realise that it is possible, since the situation in Somalia makes various things possible, however unacceptable or unimaginable they may be."
"What is more, the situation in Somalia affects the situation in the Horn of Africa, which is already so difficult and complicated."
"The human rights situation in the region and in the country will improve only when its political situation changes."
"We should therefore support the implementation of the Djibouti peace agreement, since without peace, stability, improved security and responsible government we will hear more often of tragedies such as Aisha's death."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I must add my voice to those of all my fellow Members who have spoken on this issue."
"This is yet another country where religious fanaticism is taking hold and where, in the name of justice hiding behind a religion, all the fundamental principles of our whole civilisation are being called into question."
"This situation is absolutely intolerable."
"I must say, in addition to everything that has already been said, that we must not under any circumstances forget the famine which is spreading throughout this region, both in Somalia and also in Ethiopia."
"Obviously this has nothing to do with and cannot excuse what is happening, but we must also look into the extremely serious humanitarian problem which is developing right now in Somalia."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the problem of human rights violations in Somalia, which we are discussing today, extends beyond the cases quoted in the resolution, which do indeed serve as dramatic proof of the barbarous treatment of the weakest, including girls, women and abducted nuns."
"In Somalia, where 95% of the population are Muslims and which is one of the poorest countries in the world, the majority of the people live on the brink of destitution, illiteracy reaches 70%, and average life expectancy is 47 years."
"Although Somalia regained its independence over 40 years ago, conflicts are still caused by competition between clans for grazing land and water sources."
"Before independence, the conflicts were suppressed by the colonial powers."
"Left to their own devices, the Somalis started a civil war, which intensified as the economy collapsed."
"In such circumstances, the fight against terrorism and piracy should be based above all on the elimination of poverty and destitution by humanitarian aid to the poorest and facilitation of development."
"However, Somalia's hard-won stability was destroyed by foreign intervention conducted under the banner of war against terrorism."
"The divided, poor, uneducated and easily manipulated Somali tribes are becoming an easy tool with which to continue anarchy and division."
"All peoples have the right to choose their own way of thinking and their own way of life, and international aid should not be used to spread the donors' own ideology or expand their influence."
"Not for the first time, opponents are using religion in order to discredit it and to win power, and this is happening not only in Somalia, but also in Vietnam and India, where the persecution of Catholics has become an element of election campaigns."
"However, where Christians are being persecuted, Parliament's left-liberal elements do not permit a debate aimed at the prevention of persecution and human rights violations."
"(PL) Mr President, NGOs are warning that Somalia has become an example of the most ignored of humanitarian tragedies, which is being played out before the whole world."
"Large numbers are dying of hunger, thirst and disease, and every fourth Somali child dies before the age of five."
"The country's capital, Mogadishu, is deserted."
"Artillery fire rains down on ordinary people."
"The civilian population is terrorised by suicide bombers."
"Pirates plague the Somali coast, while on land Somali Taliban forces are occupying increasingly large areas, moving gradually towards the capital and introducing the harsh Sharia law."
"Let us be under no illusions, the law is applied arbitrarily for their own purposes."
"If we include the disasters caused by drought and floods, the true scale of the tragedy becomes apparent."
"Natural disasters we can at least understand, but how is it that in poor Somalia there are so many weapons?"
"In my view, it results from the cynical behaviour of some countries, which want to conduct their frequently dirty business in that poor part of Africa, while we are pleased and consent to the Olympic Games being held in China."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, the unstable peace in Somalia manifested itself today in the shape of the work of professional pirates."
"The case now before us in the European Parliament did not receive the same sort of attention: the stoning of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow."
"That might be regarded as a still greater tragedy than the activities of pirates."
"It provides an image of a country which is living in an Islamic Middle Ages."
"The joint motion for a resolution perhaps gives too much unambiguous support for Somalia's transitional federal government."
"The Council of Ministers of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which is made up of countries in the region, met the other day."
"It condemns the Somali Government's unwillingness to work towards its commitments and peace policy."
"Representatives of other countries in the region say that the government lacks the political will and initiative to commit to peace, and that is the biggest challenge to the prevention of insecurity."
"Parliament's resolution, however, is important for Aisha, and so our group is prepared to adopt it."
"We are not going to wipe the slate clean with the Somali Government in our efforts to achieve peace."
"Mr President, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow was barely a teenager."
"She would probably have never known anything about the European Union or its Parliament."
"Even as she was being gang-raped, or lay dying under a deluge of stones, she would probably never have imagined that politicians far away would recognise her ordeal and commemorate her very short life."
"But I am sure that as she died, she knew that she was the victim of a grave injustice."
"The sickening crimes she suffered are made all the more shocking by the bizarre details of this case: the crowd of one thousand people; the venue of a stadium, as though it was some kind of spectator sport; the truckload of stones ordered specially for the purpose; the gunmen who fired at people trying, to their credit, to save this poor girl's life."
"Somalia is a failed state, and there is little the EU can do practically to address the barbarity of the various clans and Islamist militias in charge of areas outside the government's control."
"Where we can take a stand, however, is by asserting our own values, which are incompatible with Sharia law."
"That is not just my opinion, but also the opinion of the European Court of Human Rights."
"This tragic case merely reinforces our determination never to surrender our hard-won democratic freedoms to obscurantism."
"(PL) Mr President, Somalia has for years been the scene of brutal battles, lawlessness and marine piracy."
"Recently, two Poles fell into the hands of kidnappers."
"But what happened on 27 October is beyond human comprehension."
"A thirteen-year-old girl, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was stoned to death."
"The child had been raped by three men."
"The perpetrators have not been arrested or tried."
"In Kismayo, she was stoned to death by fifty men in the presence of around a thousand witnesses."
"Aisha was punished, in accordance with Islamic law, for the rape inflicted on her."
"This shocking act is not an isolated matter, but the brutal operation of Islamic law in the name of a God who punishes the victim for the crime inflicted on her."
"I call on the government of Somalia to put an end to this barbarous practice, to mete out an exemplary punishment to the perpetrators and to rehabilitate Aisha."
"Mr President, on 27 October a 13-year-old girl named Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow - and let us not forget the name - was stoned to death in Somalia by a group of 50 men in a stadium in the southern port of Kismayo in front of around a thousand spectators."
"She was accused and convicted of adultery in breach of Islamic law, but was in fact the victim of rape by three men."
"There has been no arrest or detention of those accused of her rape."
"I strongly condemn the stoning and execution of Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow and I am horrified at such a barbaric act perpetrated against a 13-year-old rape victim."
"As Unicef stated in the aftermath of her tragic death, a child was victimised twice: first by the perpetrators of the rape, and then by those responsible for administering the justice."
"This abhorrent treatment of women can in no way be condoned and permitted under Sharia law."
"This episode highlights not only the vulnerability of girls and women in Somalia, but the inherent discrimination such individuals have to endure."
"(PL) Mr President, we are today debating the murder of a girl who was stoned to death in Somalia."
"We are also aware that two Catholic nuns have been kidnapped and are being held in Somalia."
"All this is overshadowed by the piracy rampant on the Somali coast."
"We have heard that it is all due to the fact that in practice the Somali government is not functioning at all."
"Where in this situation are the mighty of this world?"
"Where are the mighty United States, China, Russia and the European Union, which claim to be civilised countries?"
"When countries are not in a position to intervene in defence of the weakest, who are being attacked by the actually not-so-mighty, they cannot be regarded as civilised."
"Where are we in this situation?"
"Mr President, I appeal to the mighty of this world: Do what is right!"
"Do your duty!"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission and Commissioner Michel, I wish to share some remarks about this issue of human rights in Somalia."
"Firstly, I would like to share the concern about the continuing conflict and political instability in Somalia."
"Somalia remains a context where fundamental rights and respect for basic human dignity continue to be shunned by armed entities perpetrating systematic and widespread attacks against civilians."
"In the last few months, an escalating wave of attacks on humanitarian workers, peace activists and human rights defenders has been sweeping southern and central Somalia."
"At least 40 Somali human rights defenders and humanitarian workers were killed between January and September 2008 alone."
"As a result of these attacks, a number of humanitarian organisations have been forced to withdraw staff from Mogadishu; humanitarian access received further blows; and human rights and humanitarian conditions further deteriorated."
"The Commission, together with the Member States and other international actors, is committed to helping at this critical juncture."
"The EU supports the efforts of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, including the Independent Expert on Human Rights in Somalia, Shamsul Bari, to come to the creation of a mechanism to investigate systematic human rights abuses by all parties."
"At the development level, the EU is strongly involved in supporting human rights organisations, mainly in training and funding for identification, documentation, monitoring of human rights abuses, and advocacy."
"In particular, the Commission is increasingly involving civil society in any programme of reconstruction and national reconciliation, including exchange programmes for civil society with other regional organisations, paralegal training, public awareness campaigns, and women's groups' work on enhancing their political representation and participation in reconciliation processes."
"Moreover, the EU supports programmes focusing on law enforcement and reinforcing the judiciary."
"Meanwhile, we need to work to improve security and to make the Somali reconciliation process move forward."
"A climate of insecurity will only serve to worsen the human rights situation and encourage violations of international humanitarian law."
"Any lasting peace in Somalia must be based on accountability and justice for the human rights violations committed by all sides throughout the Somali conflict."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, among this week's urgent resolutions, the Somali case is the one that perturbs us in particular."
"Three weeks ago a 13 year old girl, Aisha Ibrahim Duhulow, was stoned there after having been raped by three men."
"Nothing happened to the men, but the girl was sentenced for adultery under Sharia law."
"The stoning took place in a stadium in Kismayo, in southern Somalia, in the presence of 1 000 spectators, while 50 men carried out the execution."
"The sentence was handed down by the Al-Shabab militia who control the city of Kismayo."
"They also killed a boy who tried to stop Duhulow from being stoned."
"This harsh and inhuman interpretation of Sharia law, that adultery should be punished by stoning the guilty one to death, has assumed inconceivably cruel dimensions; it has led to the murder of an innocent child, who was the victim of a crime."
"It is important that we condemn the sentence and execution by stoning and insist that the Somali Government and the African Union should do the same, and that they take concrete steps as soon as possible to ensure that no such sentences are passed any longer."
"While we show our support for the attempts by the Somali Government to take control of the city of Kismayo, we also have to call on it to bring Duhulow's rapists to justice."
"As the resolution on Somalia proposes, the Member States of the EU should do more to assist Somalia, so that the country might have a democratic government, and so that the government receives the help it needs to try and take control of all the country's regions."
"2."
"Death penalty in Nigeria"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on the death penalty in Nigeria."
"author. - Mr President, the judicial system of Nigeria is fraught with inadequacies, neglect and corruption."
"To add to such a dreadful state of affairs, anachronistic Islamic Sharia courts have jurisdiction over criminal courts in one third of Nigeria's states."
"Such religious courts, run by sick-minded fanatics, continue to this day and age to terrorise the population by handing down sentences of death, flogging and amputation."
"We in Europe, of course, condemn the operation of such anachronistic religious courts, but how about the Islamic world itself?"
"Why do Islamic political figures and Islamic states, some of which are globally and regionally very powerful and influential, and some of which we have trading partnerships with, why do they not take responsibility and strongly fight against Sharia law, Islamic courts and other such evils?"
"Why do Islamic religious leaders themselves in some of the more advanced Islamic countries not condemn such use of Islamic religion?"
"In my opinion their silence or lukewarm reaction amounts to quietly supporting such activities and such a stance is, for me, just as criminal as those who actually administer Sharia law."
"Let our message of disgust with this aspect of Islamic fundamentalism reach those in the Islamic world who should be doing something drastic to change things for the better, but unfortunately they are not."
"Mr President, I feel that the case of Nigeria, although obviously not comparable to what is happening in Somalia, runs a serious risk of developing into a similar situation."
"As has been said, Sharia law is effectively being applied in one-third of the country and there has been a clear deterioration in human rights."
"At this point I must say that, before talking about or condemning any religious leaders, particularly any Islamic religious leaders, we must bear in mind that our fundamental role is to maintain dialogue with and encourage those Muslim leaders who do not share this fanatical view."
"I can assure you that there are many such leaders, and I personally know a large number."
"The problem now is that, instead of the European institutions communicating with the country and with Islam, which has the same values and viewpoints as we do, they are doing the opposite."
"The European institutions seem to be preoccupied with appeasing the most fanatical and the worst offenders, those who are butchering the human rights of all Muslims, because Muslims are - and we need to realise this - the main victims of this situation."
"They are our main allies."
"They are the people with whom we need to work. They are the people with whom we Socialists will certainly be able to tackle these challenges."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, this debate is of course in some senses a debate about the death penalty as such, but I do not want it to move in that direction, because in fact we should be discussing this specific situation."
"Of course, we are familiar with reports which tell us that the recent reduction in the number of death sentences has not reduced the country's crime rate."
"This tempts supporters of the death penalty to continue calling for it."
"But the fact is that last year only 7 out of the 53 African Union countries carried out death sentences, while in 13 the death sentence has been suspended, and in another 22 the death sentence is simply not used."
"I think that Nigeria should adopt this way forward, perhaps under pressure from the European Union."
"We could point to the fact that death sentences are carried out on the very young and the young."
"There are very many such people, at least 40 in Nigeria."
"This is a particularly shocking situation, when such young people are awaiting execution."
"This is of course a much wider issue."
"This is a country where it is very easy to sentence someone to death, especially since one quarter of Nigeria's regions are governed by Sharia law, an Islamic, a Muslim law which indeed allows the amputation of hands and feet, and also uses flogging."
"This is an unacceptable situation. We need to speak out about it."
"draftsman. - (DE) Mr President, Nigeria is one of the largest and one of the most important countries in political and economic terms in Africa."
"For this reason, it is also a major partner for us."
"Unfortunately, the situation relating to the rule of law there leaves a lot to be desired, in particular with regard to the justice system."
"During this debate we have focused on the death penalty."
"In Nigeria a large number of people are on death row."
"A quarter of them have been waiting for five years for their appeals to be concluded and 6% have been waiting for 20 years."
"This situation is not acceptable and therefore we call on the European Commission to help the Nigerian authorities to improve the rule of law and to make recommendations which may be helpful."
"The President has also established committees which have made recommendations on Nigeria that indicate the right direction to move in."
"However, I believe that more political pressure must be applied in this area."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, being sentenced to death for being poor is a reality in Nigeria."
"I appeal to the Nigerian authorities to impose a moratorium on executions and to commute the death sentences."
"Hundreds of those sentenced to death are people unable to afford a fair trial."
"Sentenced on the basis of testimony extracted under torture, without the means to employ qualified defence counsel, without a chance of finding files lost five or fifteen years ago, they await their execution in inhuman conditions."
"The windows of their cells frequently overlook the execution yards."
"Approximately 40 of those condemned to death are juveniles."
"Their alleged crimes were committed when they were 13-17 years old."
"Appeals take five years on average, but sometimes up to 20."
"Forty-one per cent of the condemned have not filed appeals."
"Their case files have been lost, or they do not know how to complete the application by themselves, and cannot afford a lawyer."
"Nigerian law does not allow torture."
"It does not recognise testimony obtained in this way as valid."
"Nevertheless, the police use torture."
"Trials are lengthy."
"The testimony of victims of torture is frequently the only evidence in a case."
"It is virtually impossible for the poor to get a fair hearing."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, the death penalty is a dreadful affair in itself."
"Rather than trying to help those who have hurt their fellow human beings or society as a whole to function as better people in future, revenge is taken by letting the condemned die."
"This is an irreparable decision which is at times even based on a miscarriage of justice."
"It becomes even more dreadful if it is not exceptional crimes that are penalised."
"In Nigeria, it is more a case of poor organisation of justice combined with administrative chaos."
"In addition, it is also increasingly about persisting in primitive, fundamentalist opinions in the northern federal states, in which it is assumed that Man has been commissioned by God to eliminate their sinful fellow men."
"Unlike Somalia, the outgrowths of which were discussed in the previous item on the agenda, Nigeria is a functioning state."
"It is a state, though, full of federal states functioning independently from one another, coordinated by a central authority which, often by means of coups d'états, has ended up in military hands."
"Things appear to be better in Nigeria at the moment, without dictatorship and without the violent conflicts of the past."
"A number of regions in the north, like Iran, parts of Somalia and the north-west of Pakistan, form the trial region for a hark-back to the Middle Ages."
"It is also a form of class justice."
"The condemned are mainly poor people without any legal aid."
"We must pull out all the stops to rescue those people from chaos, arbitrariness and fanaticism."
"(LT) Today the principal message the European Parliament sends to the Nigerian Federal and State governments is to immediately halt executions, to declare a moratorium on the death penalty and to abolish the death penalty altogether."
"After all, 137 of 192 United Nations Member States have abolished the death penalty."
"Even among the 53 African Union Member States, Nigeria is one of the few where the death penalty is still carried out."
"Both the National Study Group and the Presidential Commission working in Nigeria itself recommended that the death penalty be abandoned, as it does not reduce crime."
"I urge, ask the Council, Commission and Member States to take advantage of all available opportunities and contacts with the institutions of the Nigerian state authorities as we strive to halt the killing of people, above all minors, in the name of the law in Nigeria."
"(PL) Mr President, the death penalty has always given rise to reflection and to many questions."
"First, does one person have the right to decide about another person's life?"
"Second, can this decision be made if a confession has been extracted under torture?"
"Should young, underage criminals be executed or educated?"
"Such questions can be multiplied, but the answer will always be the same: no one has been granted this right."
"Humans have granted it to themselves."
"But since this is the case, humans can abolish it, renounce it and commit these acts no more."
"I address these words to the Nigerian authorities, but also to all those who consider themselves to be lords of another person's life and death."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, since its independence, Nigeria has enjoyed only three periods of civilian rule and has endured 29 years of military rule."
"Nine years ago, Nigeria took a step towards democracy and came back to civilian rule, even though all elections since then have been widely criticised for irregularities, fraud and violence."
"The April 2007 elections could have set a good example for other countries, but the opportunity was missed and the new government took up office amidst doubts of legitimacy."
"It is in this context, and bearing in mind the importance of a stable Nigeria for Africa, that a suitable strategy has to be found to engage the government there in a constructive dialogue over human rights."
"The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed by honourable Members on the issue of the death penalty, and agrees with the need, pending complete abolition of the death penalty, to declare an immediate moratorium on all executions."
"At the same time, it should be acknowledged that the situation of human rights in Nigeria has generally improved since the return to civilian rule."
"Indeed, some steps have been taken to launch a debate in the country over the usefulness of the death penalty as a deterrent to heinous crimes."
"Several prisoners on death row have been pardoned this year and Nigeria has committed itself to an intensified high level political dialogue with the EU which covers, inter alia, human rights issues."
"The Commission has contributed significantly to starting this process, which could lead to a global EU political strategy vis-à-vis Nigeria, and which has already led to an important ministerial troika and to a comprehensive joint communiqué."
"In the context of this dialogue, it will be possible to discuss constructively human rights issues, and to undertake a range of cooperation activities in crucial sectors such as peace and security, and governance and human rights."
"Examples of cooperation initiatives under consideration include: support for improving the investigative capacity of the Nigerian police; access to justice and support for prison reform; support for anticorruption efforts; support for the democratic process; and support for federal institutions dealing with human trafficking, illicit drugs, human rights and counterfeited medicines."
"To be effective, these actions will have to be made known to civil society and ordinary citizens."
"The Commission will develop a strategy, based on a combination of support for local mass media and cultural initiatives, to support sensitive cooperation initiatives and to disseminate to the public educational messages concerning respect for human rights and basic freedoms, the basic values of democracy, good governance, care for the environment and so forth."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) The issue of human rights still requires our attention, even when the world is facing economic crises."
"Poverty and the lack of political and economic prospects always result in a deterioration of people's living conditions."
"Respect for human rights features lower down the list among the urgent problems and it is easy for us to overlook, blinded by our own economic woes, the fact that there are places in the world where people are still punished by the death penalty."
"I am referring in this instance to Nigeria, a country with a population of 140 million, where 725 men and 11 women have been awaiting execution since February this year for committing acts such as armed robbery, manslaughter or treason, according to Amnesty International."
"Furthermore, alarming reports highlight that many of these did not go through a proper trial procedure, with evidence even being extracted under torture."
"These people will be hanged for actions which they may not have committed because in Nigeria the poor have absolutely no protection at all from the justice system, even though we are talking about a member state of the International Penal Tribunal."
"It is the duty of the international community to make every effort necessary so that the Nigerian government declares an immediate moratorium on all executions and commutes all death sentences to prison sentences."
"3."
"The case of the al-Kurd family"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on the case of the al-Kurd family."
"author. - Mr President, let me commence by stating that I am speaking in a personal capacity on this topic."
"Let me also say that I am well aware, as you all should be, that whatever is said in this Chamber regarding Israel gets scrutinised very meticulously by the Israeli authorities and then gets totally disregarded as far as the substance of the matter is concerned."
"The only action taken is to attack, in various ways, those MEPs who criticised in any way, shape or form Israeli wrongdoings."
"I have had personal experience of this."
"During the recent debates in this House on Palestinian prisoners in Israel, I used strong language to attack the Israeli Government officials."
"I did this in order to stress to them that their stance on the Palestinian prisoners was - and still is, I am afraid - utterly inhuman and criminal."
"Subsequent to my speech, not only did the Ambassador of Israel to Cyprus embark on a political defamation campaign against me, but, more importantly, the Speaker of the Knesset, Ms Dalia Itzik, wrote an official letter of complaint against me personally to the President of the European Parliament."
"Mr Pöttering replied as diplomatically as he could, and I thank him for defending the right of free speech of MEPs in debates taking place in this House."
"I also thank him for copying his reply to Ms Itzik to me."
"I have that letter here and I submit it to the Secretariat so that there is evidence that what I am saying is true."
"Furthermore, I have this message for Ms Itzik: in the European Parliament, and in the EU in general, we have the right to express our opinions freely and democratically."
"Perhaps you, Ms Itzik, should do the same in your parliament and in your country too."
"As regards the subject matter of this resolution, I wish to say the following."
"First, this is not a judicial civil matter, as some ill-informed or ill-informing Members of this House might propose: it is clearly a political matter; it is a continuation of the policy of successive Israeli Governments to kick Palestinians out of their homes and lands and to absorb by force - or by using legalistic tricks - as much of the Occupied Territories as possible into the state of Israel."
"Secondly, an attempt is made by the Israeli mission to the EU, in a document sent selectively to some MEPs, to argue that property concerned belongs to Israelis for historical reasons."
"It is claimed in that document that two Jewish NGOs bought the land on which the buildings in the contested neighbourhood are built during the rule by the Ottoman Empire."
"Quite honestly, such a claim cannot be taken seriously and deserves no further consideration."
"In conclusion, let me reiterate my position so that there can be no mistake: I respect the right of the Jewish people to have their own state, but the Jewish Government must respect the right of the Palestinian people to have theirs."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, there are two aspects to the painful problem of the expulsion of the al-Kurd family, one political and one humanitarian."
"The political aspect is the status of East Jerusalem, which is claimed as an integral part of Israel by the Israelis."
"Let us remind ourselves that neither Europe nor the international community has ever understood it as such."
"In Resolution 252, the UN Security Council quite clearly stated that all legislative and administrative measures and provisions adopted by Israel, including the expropriation of land and property which tend to alter the legal status, are invalid and cannot modify its status."
"The Security Council reminded Israel as much in 1980, when it adopted measures to make unified Jerusalem its capital, and Resolution 476 calls for the immediate cessation of policies and measures affecting the character and status of the holy city."
"Resolution 478 affirms that all measures taken to modify the status of the city are null and void."
"Neither the UN nor Europe has ever gone back on this point."
"That is why, despite all the respect that everyone in the House has for Israeli independence and justice, we know that it can only be based on the laws of its country, which conflict here with international law, and that, moreover, international law does not grant it any jurisdiction over East Jerusalem."
"The expulsion of the al-Kurd family therefore needs to be placed in this political perspective and cannot be seen merely as a property dispute."
"The al-Kurd family has been expelled for the benefit of a Jewish family which only recently emigrated to Israel."
"They have been deprived of their property right after having fought for 40 years and some of our parliamentarians who met them can describe the human drama that this expulsion represents better than I."
"I welcome the fact that we are calling across the party divide for justice to be done and for their property to be restored to them."
"(Applause)"
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the middle of the night of 9 November, the Palestinian al-Kurd family were thrown by the Israeli police out of their house in Sheikh Jarah, in East Jerusalem."
"The family consists of the mother, the semi-paralysed father with heart problems and five children, a family that have been refugees from their land since 1948, thrown out of a house in East Jerusalem, along with thousands and thousands of other Palestinians."
"Today, once again, they are without a house, although they had bought the house and had lived there since 1956."
"A group of extremist settlers - not poor Jews who were persecuted and escaped from the dreadful tragedy of the Holocaust, but fundamentalists who believe that that land is theirs by divine right - is claiming ownership of the house and 26 other homes in the same district, on the basis, as Mr Matsakis said, of an Ottoman code dating from the nineteenth century of undoubted authenticity, disputed even by the US authorities."
"There is, however, already a plan: an Israeli association wants to build 200 homes on the ruins of the houses of the Palestinians who are to be thrown out."
"Only last week, with the European Parliament's delegation in the occupied Palestinian territories, made up of MEPs from all the political groups, we visited the al-Kurd family in their house, and were direct witnesses of the bullying and violence that they were subjected to daily by the settlers, who were already in some of the houses."
"Now they are homeless, and in our resolution we are asking in paragraph 4, and I am sorry that the PPE which stands for compromise and which had voted for that paragraph - which asks for the al-Kurd family to have their house returned to them - is now asking for a split vote, because in the compromise everyone was in agreement."
"Today, though, as well as being without a house they are also without a tent, because the tent, which had been put up inside the courtyard of a Palestinian-owned house, has twice been destroyed by Israeli bulldozers."
"Another 500 families in Sheikh Jarah will also suffer this fate if we do not intervene very strongly in respect of these crimes - these constantly authorised continuous demolitions."
"I therefore believe that, as Mrs De Keyser also said, the policy towards East Jerusalem is a colonial policy by Israel that is not recognised by the international community."
"It is time, I believe, for us to say most emphatically not just 'please, Israel, respect international law,' but for concrete steps to be taken to prevent their actions from continuing to destroy the peace between Palestinians and Israelis."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, I have the feeling that this matter differs from those we discussed before."
"The drama of the thirteen-year old girl murdered before the eyes of a savage crowd in Somalia and the matter of the death penalty and of the hundreds awaiting execution in Nigeria are different from the issue we are discussing now."
"We must say that we are the observers of a drama involving a Palestinian family, and we must give this our attention."
"On the other hand, I would like to emphasise that unlike Nigeria and Somalia, this is not a black-and-white issue."
"The territory's complicated fifty-year history shows that the victims have frequently been both Jews and Palestinians."
"The balance of harm inflicted by the two sides is certainly not equal, and this is not what we are discussing now."
"I have intervened to say that we must in future try to see these matters in a broader context."
"It may be that this will give us the right to a fairer judgment than is sometimes the case now."
"draftsman. - (DE) Mr President, the history of the people of Israel is an endless tale of expulsions."
"Two thousand years ago they were driven out of their original homeland and became scattered all over the world."
"Over the centuries they have been persecuted and thrown out of the countries where they have found refuge."
"The dreadful climax of this process was the holocaust, the crime against humanity, which led to a huge number of Jewish people returning to the Holy Land, the land of their ancestors, with the result that clashes, expulsions and legal disputes have once again been taking place there."
"In a situation of this kind, the European Parliament can do nothing more than to support to the best of its ability the declared intention of the Israeli state and the peace-loving section of the Palestinian population, which I cannot guess the extent of, in order to come to a peaceful and consensual solution."
"There is no sense in picking out an individual case in an emergency and then deciding dogmatically that it will be resolved one Thursday in Strasbourg."
"However, there are clear reasons why we have taken part in this resolution."
"We wanted to become involved in this discussion process and we believe that human rights are indivisible."
"Of course, we are not indifferent to the fate of the al-Kurd family and we want to discuss their fate."
"However, we do not believe that we can do this authoritatively."
"Therefore, we think that point 4 is dogmatic in a way which does not do justice to the case."
"For this reason, our approach is to intervene on behalf of human rights, the peace process and, of course, the al-Kurd family, but we can only do this as part of a dialogue with both parties and not by unilaterally taking sides."
"Therefore we strongly support the decision, but would ask for a split vote on point 4, because this is an issue which must be decided on the spot."
"We offer our services for this purpose."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Mr President, qui bonum, allow me to disagree with the way in which this Parliament has been unwisely drawn into the specific political interests of the parties to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict."
"This is all about the fundamental ambiguity of Resolution 242 - which is older than I am myself - as this resolution does not specify the boundaries of legal jurisdiction for East Jerusalem."
"Is this a civil dispute?"
"It is not."
"Does it involve the Fourth Geneva Convention?"
"It does not."
"We are carelessly anticipating here the negotiations of a future peace conference, without having any right to do so."
"The head of the delegation to Palestine was drawn into visiting a lawfully convicted family, thereby inciting the extreme provocation of Israeli officials, out of which has come a resolution which, unfortunately, will achieve nothing."
"What is needed is to create the preconditions for a fundamental political change in the views of the European Parliament towards the participation of Israel in community programmes and to bring about an improvement in political relations, which we have unfortunately not been able to achieve through democratic means."
"Instead of a democratic solution there is the way of our MEPs, who gave the Israelis a reason for cracking down."
"Instead of solving the problems, we are pouring petrol onto the fire."
"This is not a dignified role for our parliament."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I am happy to say that I was one of those who was part of this Parliament's official delegation to the PLC two weeks ago, and we visited the al-Kurd family."
"At that point they were still hopeful that the Israeli courts would deliver a just decision."
"It is regrettable that they had a vain hope and that they have now been completely evicted from their home and, not only that, have been removed from the immediate area of their home, where they were staying in a tent."
"It is difficult to maintain any shred of hope that a sustainable two-state solution is still possible, given the war of attrition against the Palestinian people, which we witnessed on our recent visit and which this eviction is a reflection of."
"It is quite appalling that we are, at this point in time, even considering upgrading relations with Israel when there are so many breaches of international law, families being evicted, settlements being put in place."
"Eleven thousand Palestinian prisoners are in jail."
"Forty elected representatives of the Palestinian people, including the Speaker, are in jail, as are 300 children under the age of 18, including children as young as 12 years of age."
"This is not acceptable from a state which claims to be a democratic state and which claims to be complying with the norms of international law."
"It is not the case."
"The EU must insist upon the Israeli Government restoring the al-Kurd family to their home."
"Israel must be told in no uncertain terms that, if it wants to continue to do business with the EU, it must comply with democratic and humanitarian norms in practice as well as rhetorically."
"Certainly any idea that the EU should upgrade its relations with Israel, as some Member States are proposing, should be dropped so long as injustices of this kind continue."
"I would like to conclude with a point of order."
"I think that the proposal here of oral amendments on a Thursday afternoon - amendments which do not reflect the facts on the ground and which do not have the support of the joint authors of this resolution - is an abuse of the ability to place oral amendments."
"I believe that this matter should be looked at by Parliament's secretariat and proposals brought forward to ensure that it does not happen again."
"We shall of course take account of your proposal, Mr De Rossa."
"It will be sent to the proper party, knowing that oral amendments on Thursday afternoons are somewhat of a case unto themselves in that, even if there happen to be too few Members to stand and oppose them, the House can still vote against them."
"Mr President, on this point, although I strongly disagree with the oral amendments, I will nevertheless defend the right of MEPs to place oral amendments, even on a Thursday afternoon, and I will condemn most strongly the groups - and my group is one of the first that I condemn - which do not manage to have their MEPs here on a Thursday afternoon."
"I do not wish to start a debate, as I am sure you understand."
"I am just advising you of the law that applies in this House."
"Of course, every Member has the right, during voting time on Thursday afternoons, to table oral amendments."
"In accordance with our rules, a certain number of Members may oppose them."
"I should also like to advise you that these questions have already been decided at the highest level in the past."
"Obviously, if ever it was because of the Members' disaffection that an oral amendment which the House obviously did not want was imposed purely by reason of the fact that there were too few people present to oppose it, we would revert to the initial text, in order to avoid having an orally amended text which was unacceptable."
"Of course if you wish I can supply precise and detailed information on previous examples."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, before we start the clock ticking I would also like to make a point of order on this matter."
"I consider it absolutely irregular and unacceptable that Parliament's Rules can be altered because Members from one side of the House choose not to turn up on a Thursday afternoon."
"That is their problem - not ours - and we are perfectly entitled to operate within Parliament's Rules, which should be the same for every period within the working week during Strasbourg part-sessions."
"I would be grateful if you could now restart the clock for my speech."
"Mr President, in these urgency sessions we debate the gravest abuses of human rights, involving torture, rape and murder."
"The al-Kurd case in East Jerusalem does not fall anywhere near that category."
"It is a civil dispute between two private parties, and we really have no business interfering in such a dispute."
"The family was evicted by the police, who were enforcing an order of the Israeli Supreme Court."
"The family knew well in advance that eviction proceedings would be taken."
"The family had not paid their rent for 40 years, in spite of a court order ordering them to do so."
"This case has little implication on the wider issue of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Normally these debates are conducted in a bipartisan fashion."
"This debate, however, is simply another example of pandering to anti-Israeli hostility and sentiments, particularly on the other side of the House."
"Try as they might, they cannot disguise the fact that Israel is a democracy where the rule of law and independence of the judiciary remains paramount."
"I wish we could say the same about the Hamas-led authority in the Gaza Strip."
"Colleagues, are there not many more pressing issues in the wider world that merit our attention in a human rights debate?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make one thing clear, so that we are agreed."
"The rules of the European Parliament are not altered on Thursday afternoons."
"They are different on Thursday afternoons and it is our Rules of Procedure that are different."
"For example, during debates on Thursday afternoon, with the catch-the-eye procedure, we have two speakers rather than five."
"If there is a request for a referral because there is no quorum, the point is not carried forward, it is annulled."
"Requests for oral amendments are also governed by different rules, not rules at the disposal of the president of the sitting, but rules already formally included in our Rules of Procedure."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, on the night of Sunday 9 November, Israeli troops evicted the Al-Kurd family from their house in Sheikh Jarrah in the East Jerusalem area, where they had lived for over 50 years."
"The eviction resulted from a ruling handed down by the Supreme Court of Israel last July, which had brought to an end a long and very controversial trial conducted in Israeli courts and before Israeli authorities."
"It must be emphasised that the family was deprived of its home in spite of forceful protests on the part of the international community, and that the Supreme Court decision in fact paves the way to the seizure of a further 26 houses in the same area."
"The fate of the Al-Kurd family and the numerous instances of destruction of the homes of Palestinian families in the East Jerusalem area by the Israeli authorities give rise to great concerns."
"Such actions are illegal in international law, and the international community and in particular the Middle East Quartet should do everything in their power to protect Palestinians living in this area and in other parts of East Jerusalem."
"We should call on Israel to stop settlement expansion and construction of the Wall beyond the 1967 borders."
"These actions conflict with international law and seriously endanger the prospects of a lasting peace agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis."
"(PT) Mr President, I believe that there are two fundamental issues in this debate, the first of which is that we are dealing with a judicial system that is one of the most independent in the world."
"This judicial system even forced the President of its own country to resign just a short while ago."
"Secondly, this legal dispute that was ongoing for decades and that concerned ownership and non-payment of rent cannot be compared, for example, with the expulsion of millions of Iraqis who until very recently were left on their own without anyone bothering to challenge the legitimacy of the Iraqi government and without anyone having a sense of balance about what is happening in that whole region."
"For it is balance that we must talk about."
"The issue of balance is fundamental."
"I must say that I have been horrified at what I have heard here, in terms of challenging the existence of the State of Israel."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission is greatly concerned about recent developments in East Jerusalem, in particular the destruction of Palestinian-owned houses and the expansion of settlements in East Jerusalem."
"At a time when confidence-building measures are urgently needed to support the negotiation process started in Annapolis, such measures are extremely unhelpful."
"The EU, in its statement of 11 November, called on the Israeli authorities to put an early end to such measures."
"The EU has also, on numerous occasions in recent months, expressed its concern about the decision of the Israeli authorities to approve the construction of new settlements in East Jerusalem."
"The creation of facts on the ground undermines the chances for a negotiated settlement of the conflict."
"Jerusalem is one of the so-called final-status issues to be resolved between the parties in negotiations."
"The Commission has provided assistance to help preserve the Palestinian presence in East Jerusalem and is committed to continuing this support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debates."
"Debate on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)"
"1."
"Somalia (vote)"
"2."
"Death penalty in Nigeria (vote)"
"3."
"The case of the al-Kurd family (vote)"
"- Before the vote on recital B"
"Mr President, I propose an oral amendment to recital B, which would add the wording 'on disputed ownership'."
"I can read the whole thing out if you want."
"It reads: 'whereas this eviction was carried out on the basis of an order issued by the Israeli Supreme Court on 16 July 2008 following long and controversial legal proceedings on disputed ownership before Israeli courts and authorities'."
"Otherwise it does not make any sense as regards what the controversy is."
"One has to actually specify what the controversy was in law."
"Clearly forty Members have not stood to oppose the inclusion of this oral amendment."
"I shall therefore submit recital B as having been amended orally."
"Mr President, in order to have more support for this recital, I would like to propose an oral amendment to Mr Tannock's oral amendment."
"It is just to add the word 'apparent' before 'disputed', so that it reads 'on apparent disputed ownership'."
"Then Mr Tannock will be satisfied that we have put the subject matter in the recital, and we will leave the matter open."
"Mr President, I am afraid that I do not know the Rules in precise detail, but I do not think you can submit an oral amendment to an oral amendment literally in the Chamber unless the whole House agrees."
"I, personally, do not agree with that, and, I suspect, neither would most of my group."
"There is no such thing as an 'apparent' dispute: a dispute is a dispute."
"It went before the courts and that is the verdict."
"But I wanted to explain what the dispute was all about."
"I have been advised that the precedent is as follows: where there is an oral amendment to an oral amendment, if the first person who tabled the oral amendment accepts the second oral amendment as a consensus, it is taken into account."
"If the second amendment to the first amendment is not accepted by the author, it is not put to the vote."
"I am therefore sorry, Mr Matsakis, but we cannot take your amendment into account."
"However, Mr Tannock's amendment was not rejected, because forty Members did not stand and I am therefore obliged now to submit it."
"Mr President, I am sorry but I am not completely familiar with the Rules."
"Can we not simply vote?"
"We cannot avoid voting because we do not have 45, or I do not know how many Members necessary."
"We cannot avoid voting because that is the requirement when you leave."
"Surely we can vote on the oral amendments?"
"Can we just vote on the parts on disputed ownership and then see if it has the majority or not?"
"That is exactly what I was about to propose."
"We shall therefore vote now on recital B, as amended by Mr Tannock."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on recital D"
"Mr President, I am sorry to have to do this again but on recital D I am suggesting once again an additional two words in order to ensure clarity in law, because some of the interventions earlier suggested a certainty."
"This is not the case so the full recital would read as follows: 'emphasising the fact that the eviction took place despite international objections; whereas the US has raised the issue with the Israeli authorities; whereas this decision may pave the way for the takeover of 26 more houses in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, with 26 other families targeted for eviction; having regard to the political ramifications of this matter for the future status of East Jerusalem'."
"It is very clear."
"You cannot say it 'will pave': it 'may pave', and we need that to be in the hands of the courts, not in the hands of debates as enunciated by some of my colleagues earlier on."
"Mr President, I am afraid that I would like to oppose the oral amendment by my learned friend, Mr Tannock, based on evidence that, in fact, has been supplied by Mrs Galit Peleg, First Secretary of the Israeli Mission to the EU."
"I have here an e-mail she has sent to many Members, including, I suspect, Mr Tannock."
"The first line states: 'during Ottoman Empire rule, two Jewish NGOs bought the land and built the buildings in the neighbourhood', which means the whole area, thereafter - not just one house but all the buildings in the neighbourhood."
"I have it here, if anybody, including Mr Tannock, wants to have a look at it."
"I would remind you, Mr Matsakis, that there is only one way to oppose an oral amendment and that is to stand up, not to start a debate."
"I confirm that forty Members did not stand."
"Mr President, you thought we were in complete agreement and that we understood each other, but I had a different question."
"I understand that we cannot avoid voting on the amendment because we do not have sufficient Members, but surely we should be able to vote on the parts proposed by Mr Tannock?"
"That means that we should vote only on the text 'may pave' and only when that has been done should we decide on the rest of recital D. It is a bit strange that, just because you do not have 45 people here, you have to include something which might not have the majority of the House."
"It pains me to have to explain our voting mechanism to you yet again."
"If a majority votes against recital D, as amended orally, we revert to recital D before the amendment."
"If, therefore, you wish to oppose this addition, you must vote against."
"If there is no majority against, recital D will be taken as adopted as orally amended."
"The only way for you to get rid of an oral amendment which you do not like is to vote against now, because I am opening the vote."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the initial oral amendment)"
"(FR) I have one brief remark, Mr President, which I should like to be recorded in the Minutes."
"This is a joint resolution which we have taken the trouble to debate in a highly conciliatory manner."
"Everyone made concessions."
"Unfortunately, I see that, with the oral amendments which it is entitled to make and through separate votes, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has seriously changed its tenet."
"I wonder, therefore, if the procedural representatives who made the compromises have a real mandate from their group and I shall bear this in mind in future negotiations."
"We shall of course take account of your statement, which shall be included in the Minutes."
"Mr President, just very briefly, I would like to congratulate the PPE-DE Group because they manage to get the majority of their Members in this House on a Thursday afternoon and get what they want on breaches of human rights issues."
"I congratulate them."
"Mr President, I simply want to ask you to put on the record my objections to the abuse of the oral amendment system here this afternoon."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that it is very sad that compromises are made and then not abided by, and that it is very sad particularly when you think that the al-Kurd family is not just a name, but people who are forced to live - and here I am addressing you, Mr Casaca - forced to live not even in a tent, because they are not even permitted to remain in their tent."
"It truly is a sad day when Members think not about this group of human beings but only about politics."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Matsakis for his fairness."
"All the groups have already made use of oral amendments, which are very important in urgent cases, because errors can arise rapidly and sometimes need correcting."
"This is what we have done in this case and the Social Democrats, the Greens and all other groups have often done the same."
"It is important not to become offended simply because you did not have the majority on one occasion."
"(PL) Mr President, I agree with the view that the Rules of Procedure have today been abused."
"Nevertheless, the Rules of Procedure work, and the rule requiring 40 objectors is a rule, even though we know that we can never comply with it on a Thursday afternoon."
"I wanted to ask you, Mr President, what is your view and whether you think that we should change a rule requiring 40 people to object to an oral amendment when there are so few people in the Chamber that there is no way this can be achieved?"
"(PT) Mr President, I must say that respect for the human dignity of whoever it may be, in this case the al-Kurd family, whatever religion they may practice, wherever they may come from and whatever colour they may be, is my primary concern."
"I find it profoundly offensive that someone has called this into question simply because I have a different opinion from that person about a specific legislative act."
"To sum up this interesting exchange of views, I propose that this afternoon's incidents be transmitted to the competent bodies so that we can see what needs to be done."
"As far as I am concerned, I have applied our existing rules this afternoon calmly and as pedantically as possible."
"I think that, as several Members have pointed out, the problem would not arise if our benches were a little fuller on Thursday afternoons."

"Statements by the President"
"One week ago today, on 26 November, a dramatic series of coordinated terrorist attacks took place in Mumbai in India."
"According to the Indian Interior Ministry, almost 190 people lost their lives, 22 of them foreigners, as a result of these terrible attacks."
"200 people were injured in these attacks and it is still uncertain whether many of them will live."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to voice my outrage at this monstrous attack on innocent people and to express our deepest sympathy with the families of all those who have died."
"I should also like to assure those injured in the attacks and their families of our support and our heartfelt sympathy."
"The European Parliament utterly condemns these terrorist acts and would like to manifest its solidarity with India, its people and its authorities in this time of mourning."
"Today we are all Indians at heart."
"Terrorism is a direct attack on freedom, human rights and democracy."
"Terrorism is the attempt to destroy our values by means of indiscriminate violence - values which unite us in the European Union and in our Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you know that a delegation of the Committee on International Trade from the European Parliament was in Mumbai at precisely the time of the attacks."
"In the midst of all the mourning over the tragic attacks, we would nevertheless like to express our joy and relief that all the participants of this parliamentary delegation trip are with us again safe and sound because some of the members of the delegation of the European Parliament were in the hotels affected at the time of the attacks and were in immediate mortal danger."
"Welcome back to Brussels all of you."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in particular I should like to greet the following in our midst: Ignasi Guardans, who led the delegation, Daniel Caspary, Béla Glattfelder, Syed Kamall, Sajjad Karim, Erika Mann, Jan Tadeusz Masiel and Mia De Vits."
"It is wonderful that you are all here again."
"(Applause)"
"I am also delighted that the following Members of the European Parliament are with us again and I greet them just as warmly: Alberto Rodas, Christopher Ford, Levente Csaszi and Vladymyr Dedobbeleer, and members of the political Groups Arielle Rouby and Barbara Melis as well as the interpreters Vincent Capet from the European Parliament and the two freelance interpreters Karen Twidle and Michael Hill."
"(Applause)"
"We are all relieved that all in all you are well, and I hope that you can soon recover from this terrible experience mentally as well."
"My special thanks and my acknowledgement go to the people in India, to those who offered you protection and assistance despite the uncertain local situation."
"My thanks go also to the consulates of those Member States of the European Union who all according to the letter and spirit of the European Treaty showed solidarity in offering you assistance in an emergency."
"I should like to remind everyone that all citizens of the European Union whose country of origin has no local representation - as in this case in Mumbai - can contact the consulate of any other EU Member State."
"Such situations represent the genuine expression of a concrete solidarity between the people of the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"Fellow Members, today, however, our thoughts go above all to the victims of the attacks in India and to their families."
"Their death and the circumstances which led to it are crimes which are unacceptable under any circumstances."
"Terrorism - wherever and by whoever it is committed - must be met with determined action and solidarity."
"The European Union is called upon to combat terrorism in any form together with the international community."
"In this we are guided by our principles of the rule of law."
"The fight against terrorism may only be conducted in accordance with those values which we defend."
"I have just heard the terrible news that less than an hour ago a 70-year-old businessman, Mr Ignacio Uría Mendizabal, was murdered - it is said by ETA, it is not yet confirmed - in the Spanish town of Azpeitia, in the Basque Country."
"I wish to condemn this terrorist attack and to express my deep sadness and profound sympathy to the family and friends of Mr Uría."
"I want also to express my solidarity with the Spanish people, their authorities and democratic institutions."
"I should like to ask you to rise from your seats in remembrance of the victims in Mumbai and the murdered citizens of the European Union in Spain and to commemorate the dead."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, many of you are wearing the little red bow at this time."
"Last Monday, 1 December 2008, marked the 20th World Aids Day."
"Aids-HIV is a terrible illness with which approximately 7 000 people are infected worldwide every 24 hours - without knowing it."
"Africa is the most severely affected, with 33 million already infected with HIV."
"But in Europe as well people are infected with the virus daily."
"According to official figures from the World Health Organisation WHO, between 1999 and 2006 more than 800 000 new infections were confirmed in Europe - just under 270 000 of them in the Member States of the European Union."
"At least every tenth newly infected person is under 25 years old."
"This underlines the urgent necessity for reinforced information and prevention campaigns and the provision of voluntary - as well as anonymous - tests."
"We must make a political undertaking to increase the resources for combating this illness and take measures for early detection and thus the earliest possible care and treatment."
"On behalf of the European Parliament, I should like to expressly ask the Member States to take measures to prevent any discrimination and stigmatisation of those infected."
"(Applause)"

"The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 20 November 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"It has been requested that this draft be amended as follows:"
"Wednesday"
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance propose postponing both the voting on the report by Mrs De Keyser on the participation of the State of Israel in Community programmes and the voting on the motions for a resolution regarding the same topic."
"Mr President, our request is based on a very clear fact known to everyone."
"At the end of last May, an official delegation from our Parliament, representing all political groups, went to Israel and visited the Palestinian territories including Gaza."
"On the basis of what they observed on the ground, at the end of this visit, they unanimously adopted a statement."
"This statement includes the following:"
"'We strongly feel that without serious signs of good faith translated into tangible improvements on the ground, the time is not yet right to upgrade EU-Israel relations'."
"(FR) Since then, no such significant signs have been apparent, quite the contrary."
"This is why we think that it would be a very bad signal today if we were to vote in favour of the recommendation made by the Council."
"My group proposes that we postpone this vote until there is evidence, in Israel's policy and on the ground, of these famous signs called for unanimously by the delegation representing our Parliament a few months ago."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sometimes we must take very difficult decisions."
"I think that the dispute which we in Europe - here in this House - are having about Israel and Palestine is always very difficult."
"When we take decisions, we must also actually keep the vision in mind."
"It would be disastrous if this House were to vote against a motion to strengthen the connections between Israel and the European Parliament."
"I repeat, it would be disastrous to vote against it."
"But it would also be disastrous to vote in favour when we all know how difficult and delicate the situation is."
"I was in Israel 14 days ago and saw for myself that both the Israelis and the Palestinians really are at the end of their tether."
"It would be disastrous to increase the frustration of the Israelis by saying no."
"And it would be just as disastrous to increase the frustration of the Palestinians by saying yes."
"Therefore, if we are intelligent, let us postpone the vote."
"For we still need to talk, we need to act."
"Sometimes it is more intelligent to continue the discussion calmly than to take a decision emotionally and too quickly which will frustrate and disappoint either one side or the other."
"In Europe we have a mediatory function and we must retain this function."
"For this reason, we propose postponing this vote."
"Being intelligent sometimes means waiting."
"Mr President, I must mention in this regard that Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, including the rapporteur, Mrs de Keyser, voted overwhelmingly in favour of Mrs de Keyser's report."
"As we said to the Israeli Foreign Minister yesterday when she met with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, we understand the extreme concern felt by this House about the humiliation and frustration that the people of Palestine are suffering."
"It is precisely for those reasons, however, that we believe that Parliament has to take a stand, Mr President, in the first instance by means of a resolution."
"I can announce that my political group will accept the amendments tabled by the Left to establish a relationship."
"It is not a matter of upgrading relations with Israel, Mr Wurtz, but of voting for a resolution and for the assent that the European Parliament, according to the powers attributed to it by the Treaties, has to give to negotiations undertaken by the European Commission and the 27 Member States."
"That, Mr President, is why we believe that the European Parliament has to take a firm stand for peace - peace in the Middle East - and give its assent to the agreement on scientific and technological cooperation with Israel."
"This item must therefore be kept on the agenda for the present plenary, as the Conference of Presidents of the political groups itself decided."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to inform you that a group of high-ranking religious dignitaries and persons from civil society from Bulgaria, headed by His Eminence Metropolitan Dometian of Vidin, has taken its place on the VIP rostrum."
"Our guests are taking part in a seminar on Cultural Diversity in Europe which is taking place on 4 December here in the European Parliament."
"I extend a very warm welcome to you all in the European Parliament in the last month of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"Welcome to the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Preparation of the European Council (11-12 December 2008) (debate)"
"The next items are the statements by the Council and the Commission on the preparations for the European Council on 11 and 12 December 2008."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, honourable Members, first of all Mr President, I should like to add my condolences, feelings and solidarity to yours for the victims of these barbaric acts in Mumbai, for the Indian people, who were also victims of these tragedies."
"I should also like to say that, having welcomed Mr Guardans when he arrived at Roissy Airport, at European level, we must all learn lessons from our cooperation between the various consulates, and I echo your words Mr President; we must definitely improve coordination in this area at European level, even before a single diplomatic service is established."
"I should finally like to add my words of condolence for the Spanish victim and confirm our solidarity on behalf of the Council, with our Spanish friends and the Spanish authorities."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, honourable Members, the forthcoming European Council on 11 and 12 December - my apologies, I did not mention the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mrs Wallström - is extremely important."
"They have a very full agenda: the future of the Treaty of Lisbon, Europe's response to the international economic and financial situation, the battle against climate change and the energy package are all due to be discussed."
"With regard to the Treaty of Lisbon, we are in contact with the Commission, with our Irish friends."
"Transpartisan work has been carried out in Ireland over the last few days, at which you were present, Mr President, representing the European Parliament."
"You were also questioned by the Irish Parliament on this issue."
"I believe that the work of this group is leading to three outcomes."
"The first is that the Irish Members of Parliament believe that Ireland risks being marginalised to a certain extent in the European Union, and will subsequently suffer in the short and medium term."
"The second element is that the full and complete participation of Ireland in the European Union still remains, in their opinion, completely desirable."
"Finally, the third element, which is that a solution must be proposed by Ireland so that it can remain at the heart of the European project, while providing a response to the concerns expressed at the time of the referendum on 12 June."
"As you know, the Irish Government has not yet formally adopted a position to indicate whether or not it approves these recommendations and whether or not it wishes to implement them, or by what method."
"We have been in contact, and between now and the end of the week there will be further contact with the Presidency of the Council, between Prime Minister Cohen, and President Sarkozy."
"You will understand that I cannot speak on behalf of the Irish authorities."
"However, as far as the Presidency of the Council is concerned, we are very keen to help our Irish friends, to understand their possible requests in the various areas, to see what legal guarantees they need, while of course respecting and considering the fact that twenty five Parliaments have already ratified this treaty, that we are expecting a twenty-sixth ratification at the start of 2009, and that we wish to provide a clear and positive signal with regard to the actual entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is the entire thrust of the road map that we will propose, and which we will be discussing at this European Council."
"With regard to the economic and financial situation, we have already held numerous debates in this Chamber."
"I would therefore like to reiterate the main issues, since Europe is being severely hit by the economic slowdown."
"Confronted with an exceptional situation, we have to show that we are able to respond."
"We have to demonstrate unity, the same decision-making capacity we exhibited last October when a coordinated response had to be found to the risk of the entire financial sector collapsing."
"It is in this spirit that the Presidency will lead the work of the Council on 11 and 12 December."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, will express this better than I can, the Commission adopted proposals for a European recovery plan on 26 November; these were examined at Monday's 'Competitiveness' Council and at the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers."
"This constitutes a coordinated European response to the economic crisis which makes use of the Community instruments available and allows Member States to take the measures most suitable for their situations in close coordination with one another and respecting certain principles."
"I should like to say that the Commission's proposals are a move in the right direction as far as the Presidency of the Council is concerned."
"We must try to release marginal funds from the Community budget, wherever they are available, with regard to the European Social Fund, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, and the Structural Funds."
"We must also make use, as proposed by the Commission, of more funds from the European Investment Bank and we are counting on your Parliament to fully participate in the mobilisation of the Community institutions in response to the crisis."
"It is chiefly the responsibility of Member States to deploy every means possible to support economic activity over the coming year, taking account of the forecasts produced by the Commission as well as by other institutions."
"The Commission proposes a joint effort between what can be done at Community level and what is done in Member States, of up to EUR 200 billion, that is to say 1.5% of Community GDP."
"I know that there is some apprehension with regard to these figures."
"It seems to us, as the Presidency, that the effort proposed by the Commission responds to the problems that we must confront and the necessary stimulus."
"We are well aware that the Community authorities cannot guarantee everything since their instruments are limited, particularly in terms of the budget, particularly with regard to allocations and that not everything can be done at Community level."
"The authorities, however, must guarantee that national recovery actions are consistent and coordinated so that the greatest overall effect for economic recovery to the benefit of the Union is achieved."
"Along with the Commission, we believe that we need targeted sectorial and transitional support measures."
"These measures must be compatible with the Union's long-term priorities and the Lisbon Strategy, and they must be rapidly implemented."
"We believe that a priority action must target the European industrial base, particularly the 'backbone' industries such as the automotive sector which, as you know, is very seriously affected by the economic slowdown."
"In association with the European Investment Bank, Member States ought to be allowed to provide support to their manufacturers in order to support efforts to develop new technologies, particularly clean cars."
"We must also, as highlighted at the 'Competitiveness' Council, obtain more room for manoeuvre in order to support small and medium-sized enterprises which are particularly adversely affected by this crisis, and in particular, are currently threatened with credit restrictions, bearing in mind the continuing state of the European financial sector."
"We are determined to obtain the most ambitious possible overall plan at this Council at its forthcoming meetings on 11 and 12 December."
"With regard to the climate and energy package, Mr President, we will be holding a debate tomorrow in this Chamber."
"On behalf of the Council, I should like to thank Parliament once again for its extremely constructive attitude in the dialogue that we have had on the energy and climate package."
"Our aim is and will continue to be a first reading agreement between now and the end of the month."
"This is not a vanity project for the French Presidency, nor is it a question of finding out whether it will be one more feather in the cap of the Presidency."
"That is not the issue."
"The issue is that Europe, I repeat, must be ready to meet international timescales, bearing in mind the 2009 timetable, and must be ready to take the desired initiatives in Poznań, at the conference which has just opened, and in Copenhagen next November."
"Your rapporteurs are very aware of this."
"There have been a large number of substantial exchanges between your Chamber and Jean-Louis Borloo in order to successfully complete this negotiation."
"What we wish, the aim of the Presidency is clear: there are targets and there is consistency in the package proposed by the Commission."
"These targets and this consistency must be protected."
"We must not deviate from the initial reasoning proposed by the European Commission."
"We must incorporate two components: the first comprises being sufficiently flexible towards those countries that, bearing in mind their geographical situation and economic development, have to make efforts in the area of greenhouse gas emission reductions, and I am thinking in particular about our Central and Eastern European friends; the second component comprises finding, bearing in mind the economic crisis, the necessary flexibility for the industrial sectors that are most severely affected by these energy consumption problems."
"These are the lines along which we are working very closely with the Commission and with other Member States, and we must all be united so that concrete results can be achieved and this package adopted between now and the end of the year."
"So, Mr President, Mr Barroso, honourable Members, this is a crucial Council."
"Europe is now at a crossroads in several areas, namely, the institutional, economic and energy areas."
"This will be a difficult Council."
"It must be able to deal with the situation in the European Union."
"This is why in the Council, Commission and Parliament, we must do absolutely everything within our power to reach these various goals successfully."
"We are of course aware, however, of the difficulty of our task."
"President of the Commission. - (FR)."
"Mr President, Mr Jouyet, honourable Members, firstly may I concur with you Mr Pöttering in everything that you have said relating to the tragedy in Mumbai, and also say that I share your sentiments relating to the need for the spirit of solidarity in Europe, and the spirit of what must be real European citizenship to be put into practice."
"I think that we will all be able to learn lessons from these events and demonstrate the reality of the fine ideas of European citizenship and solidarity."
"Over the last few months, Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union has indeed been faced with a series of major challenges: a conflict in Georgia, an unprecedented financial crisis and an unexpected recession."
"The European Union has so far correctly assessed these extraordinary events and has, I am absolutely convinced, performed creditably."
"Thanks to the shared commitment and close cooperation of our three institutions and, I must add, the energy and skill of the French Presidency, the usefulness and relevance of the European dimension has been made clear."
"We have shown Europeans in particular and the world in general that the European Union was up to the task: able to provide a swift and coordinated response and ready to work hand in hand with its partners on the world stage."
"But let us be absolutely clear and honest with each other: the key work still needs to be carried out over the coming weeks."
"Because we are facing a large number of challenges, in particular, three major challenges, which can only be met if the three major European institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - continue to collaborate, with each one fulfilling its role in the pursuit of our common aims: first of all to take decisive measures, which must be immediately implemented, to put Europe on the path to economic recovery, to provide a response to the crisis in the real economy; secondly, to demonstrate that Europe is equipping itself with the resources to become the world's leading low-carbon economy and that we can keep our position as world leader in the battle against climate change; and thirdly, to draw up a road map for the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am sure there are lots of other areas I could mention, in particular in the field of external relations, where I should like to say that we in the Commission are today proud to have approved a communiqué which sets out the considerably ambitious aims for a real Eastern Partnership policy but, as time is short, I am now going to concentrate on those three challenges which I see as the greatest challenges for the European Council in December."
"First of all, let us look at the European plan for economic recovery."
"During the debates which took place prior to the European Council in October this year; problems were having a knock-on effect and the financial crisis was already spreading to the real economy."
"A week later, in a communiqué we approved, the Commission proposed an EU-level policy framework for action."
"We said that we needed an economic response to the financial crisis and that this must be made in a coordinated fashion."
"A consensus was broadly reached for this policy framework, being approved at the last informal European Council and by Parliament at its part-session last month."
"But this policy framework also fed into the global strategy defined at the G20 summit, where it was used as a basis for discussion."
"Finally, the approach recommended by this reference framework policy was adopted by Member States when defining their own courses of action."
"As well as providing detailed implementation methods, the European plan for economic recovery, as presented by myself last week, elevated this coordination to a new level of ambition."
"I wish to pay tribute to the boost given by Parliament to the recovery plan, in the form of its parliamentary committee and plenary part-session debates, and in particular, the debate I had with the Conference of Presidents, and I should like to thank the President of Parliament and the chairmen of the various groups for their contributions, which made this debate possible."
"The implementation of this plan must enjoy the same sustained dialogue as its preparation."
"By proposing to inject EUR 200 billion to kick-start our economy, our recovery plan, which comprises ten detailed priorities, shows a degree of common action that is unprecedented at European level."
"The challenge was enormous, as was the risk of failure, since an ambitious plan on the same scale as the need had to be defined."
"The plan is not based on the smallest common denominator but nor does it ignore the widely varying budgetary and economic positions of the various Member States, even though all Member States are part of a common market and the majority of them have a common currency."
"We therefore have to confess that it is no easy task, that it is really quite difficult to find, from an intellectual and also obviously from a political point of view, an economic response for 27 countries with such different starting points."
"This is why we have not defined a one-size-fits-all plan, but a coordinated plan, based on the instruments already at our disposal in Europe, the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, but by defining the common aims to be pursued in a coordinated fashion for economic recovery."
"This plan must now be translated into reality."
"The concept of coordination must not simply prevail at the time of agreement but also during implementation, since the price of inaction is unacceptable."
"We ourselves can testify to this: job losses are occurring daily."
"We cannot wait for the recession to get worse and degenerate into a serious depression."
"I think that we can all see a change of attitude even if this change of attitude has not yet fully been translated into concrete decisions."
"Everybody is very well aware that we are not dealing with an ordinary fall off in economic activity."
"We are in a completely different situation, which is not an ordinary drop in economic activity; we are, I repeat, experiencing exceptional circumstances and that now is the time to act."
"Each institution must fulfil its responsibilities."
"The Commission has done so by presenting this plan and will continue to do so to ensure its implementation."
"I am counting on the vigilance of Parliament to remind each institution of its commitment."
"This recovery plan offers the necessary policy framework for decisive and ambitious action."
"I believe that it is at the same time both ambitious and realistic; putting forward ambitious proposals that have no chance of being approved is pointless."
"At the same time, however, we must retain this ambition."
"This plan shows that the basic principles established by the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon Strategy have rendered us capable of providing a real European solution."
"This is a great opportunity which must be seized by Europe."
"I believe that this is a real test for Europe."
"Not merely a test of its economic response, which is demanding enough, but also of the very idea of Europe."
"What is our idea of Europe?"
"Do we or do we not want to have European responses to European and to global economic problems?"
"United in action, Europe can demonstrate that it is capable of: providing the necessary coordination so that each can deploy all its forces in the battle; offering, on a customised scale, the required budgetary stimulus to guarantee a real impact, while ensuring the medium- and long-term viability of public expenditure levels; ensuring intelligent use of short-term tools for boosting long-term competitiveness by killing two birds with one stone: the stimulus must limit the impact of the crisis on households, workers and businesses in the short-term, while simultaneously easing the transition towards a less energy-intensive economy, while supporting reforms for European competitiveness, in the medium- and long-term; ensuring all our actions are imbued with the key imperatives of solidarity and social justice, which must primarily be focussed on the most vulnerable in this time of crisis."
"We have therefore set out three clear priorities, three foundation stones for the strategy which has the needs of the most vulnerable sectors of society as its underlying across-the-board priority."
"This is not the time for restricting actions to the national level."
"Let us be absolutely clear about this."
"This is the message that I would like to send to the European Council and I know that I can count on Parliament to echo my message."
"Only a European-level solution will have the necessary scope to make a difference, to everybody's benefit."
"Parliament's support is essential."
"I would therefore like to ask you to examine new proposals, speed up procedures and adjust the European budgetary framework."
"Here too, we must be clear."
"I think that it would be completely contradictory if we now were to ask Member States to make an additional effort as regards their budgets, budget boosts, while we at European level, were unable to use all the appropriations at our disposal in the Community Budget."
"The Commission has therefore, I believe, produced a good proposal, saying that all unspent appropriations should be used to support certain programmes and launch certain European actions, whether for interconnections, innovation, climate-friendly energies or for an economic recovery policy that is also full of potential in the medium term."
"I believe this is the very least that should be done."
"But above all, I invite you to explain to our fellow citizens how the European Union is providing protection, not by taking action on behalf of States, but quite the reverse, by increasing the effectiveness of the actions taken by States, combining our efforts to stimulate demand and restore confidence for the benefit of all our citizens."
"The second point on the European Council agenda is climate change."
"I know how much time and attention this Parliament has devoted to the climate change energy package."
"You have shown how this is truly one of the major political, economic and 'civilisational' projects of our time."
"When we look back at what will be an historic decision, your support for the objective and your input into how it should be reached will prove to have been invaluable."
"It is now almost a year since the Commission made its proposals."
"In that time we have seen a major economic downturn."
"We have heard understandable concerns from industry at a time of intense pressure."
"But the commitment to the core goal has not wavered: to meet the 20/20/20 targets by 2020; to show the way for a global agreement at Copenhagen next year; and to prove that we are serious and we mean business when discussing these issues."
"Of course there is much to be done before the Council and Parliament reach a final agreement."
"This is how it should be."
"These are critical decisions impacting on the life of every European."
"They deserve to be taken seriously."
"We must get it right."
"The European Council next week will be key to reaching agreement between the Heads of State and Government of the 27."
"But while agreement amongst the 27 is a necessary condition for a deal, it is not in itself sufficient."
"Believe me, nobody knows better than the Commission the crucial role Parliament plays as a co-legislator."
"You have proven time and again that your input is indispensable, not only for the democratic legitimacy of European legislation, but also for its effectiveness."
"Your work is critical in building a broad cross-party, cross-national consensus on essential pieces of legislation."
"We will need you to play this role on the climate and energy package too. A lot has already been achieved in recent trialogues."
"I am confident we can travel the rest of the way together as well. I really believe we can and should reach a deal at the European Council - and I welcome the efforts of the very hardworking French Presidency of the Council, with which the Commission is actively cooperating."
"This is why, right after the European Council, I propose to take up its outcome in trialogues with the European Parliament in order to iron out remaining differences and translate political agreement into legal texts."
"I am confident that we will be able to conclude work in good time and show that climate action, energy security and economic growth can and must be pursued in a mutually supportive way."
"This is the best message we can send ahead of the European elections, but also ahead of the coming into office of the next United States President, and in view of Copenhagen."
"I give my commitment that the European Commission will work tirelessly with you to make this possible."
"Finally, there will doubtless be some who would argue that, in the current situation, discussing the Treaty of Lisbon is a distraction."
"They would be wrong."
"The European Union today is proving itself more essential than ever in terms of promoting the economic and social well-being of its citizens."
"Giving it the tools to do this task more efficiently, more democratically, is not a distraction."
"It is an imperative."
"The crises we have been experiencing have all underlined this need."
"I believe that the European Union has shown a lot of maturity in responding to the 'no' vote in Ireland, by respecting the outcome, and by giving the Irish authorities the time to digest and analyse, time to work out how to address this situation."
"Above all, Europe has shown its determination to keep working towards the prize of the new Treaty."
"Member States have continued to ratify."
"The Commission, like this Parliament, has continued to put the case for the Treaty."
"And we have worked together with Ireland - not against it - to find the right way forward."
"There remains an urgency to see the Treaty in force."
"There remains a need to respect the decisions of the 25 national parliaments which have ratified."
"And the overriding goal of the European Council must be to set out a credible way forward which will allow Ireland to ratify as well."
"By the end of next week, we need to have a road-map that leads us out of this impasse."
"2008 will go down in the history books as a year when the European Union faced some of its most difficult tests. But also, I believe, when it showed itself determined enough, decisive enough, and bold enough to meet the challenge."
"Let us use the next few weeks to leave a legacy of a stronger, more ambitious European Union for the future."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council next week will mainly be examining the response to the current economic crisis, and I should first like to pay tribute to the work of the European Commission."
"Since the start of the financial crisis, it has presented a large number of documents aimed at reforming the global financial architecture."
"The recovery plan presented last week, which we welcome, is in addition to all these measures and represents a suitable tool for responding to our current difficulties."
"Like the Commission, we think that recovery plans must be implemented as quickly as possible, and like the Commission, we think that the coordination of these recovery measures is the key to success."
"The economy and social cohesion in our countries constitute a fundamental priority."
"Moreover, in order to solve our problems in the long term, we have to demonstrate both determination and an attitude of responsibility."
"The Commission's proposals, aimed at bringing together all the political levers available at European and national levels to combat this crisis represents an excellent approach."
"Our priority must be to do everything we can to prevent a downward spiral into recession."
"We must restore consumer confidence because only that can rapidly alter the situation."
"I am very sad that some political groups do not share this approach and intend to exploit the crisis and try to gain political advantage."
"The aim of the centre-right, our aim, is not to spout slogans but to restore stability, growth and jobs, full stop."
"Our aim is also to show Europeans what must be defended at all costs: our model of the social market economy, which is the envy of the world and for which we must fight, because it alone can ensure and guarantee our social cohesion."
"If I were a capitalist, everybody would know it!"
"Faced with a crisis which demands urgent, realistic and pragmatic measures, some people prefer to accuse the opposition in order to hide their own sins."
"We are very well aware of the seriousness of this crisis but we also are aware of our duty to take action on the basis of our values and our pragmatic ways of doing things, to find the correct balance between the short and long term."
"The measures that have become necessary as a result of our current problems must not jeopardise our future."
"This is why we support the Commission's approach, which places its action within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"Indeed, this strategy is the best guarantee of preserving our social model; any other strategy would be irresponsible."
"However, adopting the recovery measures does not mean Member States can renege on the structural reforms essential for the adjustment of their economies."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council will also be largely devoted to the climate and energy package, which the French Presidency has quite rightly made one of its key priorities."
"Negotiations are still continuing on the majority of the documents in the package and I call on all those involved in the negotiations to do everything in their power to reach a satisfactory agreement."
"Global warming is a reality that neither the financial crisis nor the current economic crisis has changed."
"The European Union must show the way to its world partners by adopting a responsible political attitude appropriate for the current situation."
"Its battle against climate change must continue, however."
"The fact that progress has been made on one of the documents in the climate and energy package is a very positive sign, and evidence that there is a real desire to move forward on these texts, which I welcome."
"I pay tribute to the determination of the French Presidency, which has spared no effort in reaching an agreement."
"I should also like to express my wish that our Irish friends propose a road map to the European Council that is at once realistic and ambitious and provides a timetable for ending the institutional impasse."
"This crisis is showing us once more: Europe must be capable of making decisions more effectively and more democratically."
"Finally, I should like to thank the Commission for the Eastern Partnership project, which it is going to propose to the Council."
"If I were now to say that you are always exemplary, it might be construed as bias."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, we now have 17 million unemployed in Europe."
"Unless we do something, we will have 21 million unemployed in Europe within a year, and 25 million unemployed at the beginning of 2010."
"On 14 November, this Group said that we need to have a clear goal, and the Socialist and Social Democrat Party said the same at the weekend."
"Our goal must be not to allow the employment level to go down."
"Our financial stimulus will be defined by this clear goal of keeping people in work."
"We will lose jobs but we will create new ones to keep people in work."
"What I find missing here in the Commission's programme is not direction, but ambition and true coordination."
"I know it is difficult."
"Please do not say that simply combining efforts - which is what governments always have done - is coordination, because it is not."
"I share your ambition of coordination, but let us join forces - this Parliament and you and the Council President - to ask the governments for once to understand how much added value you can get by doing things in a coordinated way."
"You and I know that you will get double the effect in your Member States."
"My second point is this. If you do that, please could you, and the President of the Council, put this question to your colleagues, the Heads of State and Government in the Council: if we want to ensure the employment level, how much do we need?"
"I have done the macro-economic calculations, which show that we need to invest - as the Spanish Government did - one percent of GDP, not only next year, but also in 2010 and in 2011."
"Otherwise we will not keep to this level."
"So how do we do this?"
"I would propose the following: that you, Commission President, make a list of priorities defined by our smart green growth strategy and the Lisbon goals, where the 27 Member States say that they agree with you and with the Council on this list."
"Then show Germany, France, Italy - all of us - how much added value we are gaining by doing things together."
"Then draw up a time schedule saying, for example: if you make your decisions before Christmas, we will meet again in February, before the spring, to evaluate what the effects have been."
"We will then be ready in the spring to make the second package and in the autumn to make the third package as part of a long-term strategy of ensuring our goals."
"I am not saying that it will be easy."
"I am saying that I share your ambition but I am not seeing the goals being put into practice."
"Let us join forces and do it."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, last time we met we praised the Council's speedy response to the financial crisis."
"But for this European Council, speed seems no longer to be of the essence. Well, it should be."
"The challenges facing our Union are real."
"The recession is smothering businesses and climate change grows ever more stark."
"We need the Council and the Commission to acknowledge what Martin Luther King called 'the fierce urgency of now'."
"Yesterday, our finance ministers failed to grasp the urgency of the recovery plan."
"The stimulus impulse is changing from sugar to treacle."
"The Presidency should tell us which Member States were against."
"We have got to stay within the Stability and Growth Pact, maintain competition and state aid rules and meet the challenge of the Lisbon Agenda, but we have got to act fast."
"The Council will, of course, search for a legally binding framework to cut carbon emissions."
"There has been progress: cap and trade, not regulation and burden, derogations for small-scale emitters, sensitivity to individual states' circumstances and a sliding scale for carbon auctioning - all these are reasonable."
"What would not be reasonable is any attempt by any Member State to shoot down a long-term plan for short-term self interest."
"If we do not tackle climate change now, the bill will balloon."
"Last week's deal on CO2 from cars shows how easy it is to take the path of least resistance, to let vested interests get ahead of global interests."
"There will be costs in a climate-change deal, but there are opportunities too."
"Europe can lead the world in green innovation."
"The prizes go to the bold and Europe must have the courage of its convictions."
"Last week, the Irish published a thoughtful report on options for the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Now the Taoiseach must come forward with a concrete plan and a clear time frame for moving forward, because Europe's citizens want an effective European Union."
"You will never convince anyone to have more confidence in our Union if it does not work."
"And we saw last week an example of the Union not working."
"Members of this House who escaped last week's bombings in Mumbai were met by an EU consul who told them he would help only citizens from his own country."
"Nothing shows more the urgent need for coordinated EU consular protection."
"Our Union must protect all its citizens in their time of need."
"The Commission President has said 'we sink or swim together'."
"Well, some may prefer to tread water, but Europe has done that before and it does not work."
"We need action now from the European Council."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, One week before the delegation from the European Parliament leaves for Poznań, it should be assessed whether what the Commission now keeps repeating is really true, namely that the reaction to the crisis of the real economy and to the crisis in the financial markets is linked to an ambitious climate protection strategy."
"Once again I maintain at this point that everything which the Commission has said to date in this regard is disproved in the current negotiations of the trialogue on the climate package."
"The signal given by the car deal at the beginning of the week is: Europe has indeed promised ambitious climate protection and to save the world."
"Europe wants to change everything, but not its cars."
"I think that we have given an extremely poor signal."
"Let us continue with emissions trading."
"We know that emissions trading is the most important instrument of European climate protection policy, that bidding is the be-all and end-all of operation."
"Now an exception is even to be negotiated for the energy industry and energy-intensive industry is to be excluded for almost the whole of the next decade."
"I think that is a very poor announcement, only one week before we go to Poznań."
"At least half of the ambitious efforts to reduce CO2 should be made in developing countries, not in Europe itself."
"However, we do not want to fund these measures in developing countries either."
"Mr Barroso, I should like to earnestly request that you at last formulate the new green deal about which Mr Dimas always also speaks so much."
"I should also like to say to you that I believe that acceptance by the citizens of the European Union would be much greater and would increase if mistakes which were made in the old economic strategies of the European Commission, mistakes with regard to the financial markets as well, were to be assessed, if you were to acknowledge your incorrect estimates of a year ago."
"Then perhaps people would believe the new start, then greater approval for the Treaty of Lisbon could be counted on as well."
"At this point, as I did two weeks ago in Strasbourg, I would really beg you to be honest in the matter."
"Is there a new green deal or do you indeed wish to pursue the strategies of the last decade?"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office, Mr Jouyet, and the President of the Commission for their presentations here today."
"I would like to speak very briefly on the issue of the economic recovery plan because that, in a lot of ways, is what concerns the citizens and the people most with regard to how we are going to react and respond to the unprecedented global issues which have befallen us over the last number of months."
"I welcome the Commission's recovery plan and proposal."
"It does dovetail and fit nicely into what the Member States are already doing and, indeed, what the Member States agreed to do under a coordinated plan under the French Presidency."
"It is quite unique - and quite ironic in one sense - that it took this crisis to bring the British Government into the club to see how we can cooperate and coordinate together, despite the many years of striving to stay outside and to chart their own individual course."
"What this issue brings about more than anything else is a recognition that, yes, we have independence, yes, we can do things individually but, when we act collectively, when we come together and bring the great brains, innovation, talent and energy of the 27 Member States together, then you can truly change the world with that individual collective effort."
"I congratulate Commission President Barroso and the President of the Council for allowing us to mature in 2008 as a European Union, to respond as adults to what were severe crises and criticisms with regard to Europe's ability to react."
"That brings me on to the second point that we will discuss in the Council, the issue of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Obviously there are huge concerns amongst many people with regard to how we are going to resolve the issues that are left over because of the failure to ratify Lisbon in every Member State."
"I am quite confident that the Irish Government will come forward with a plan of how things should happen."
"That plan will call on other Member States to do certain things as well."
"It is not just the Irish on their own who have to deal with this problem."
"Every Member State - again acting collectively - has to deal with this problem."
"I would encourage all Members to look at the report that the Special Committee in the Oireachtas, the national Parliament in Ireland, brought forward."
"It is notable that the only people who objected to that report were the same people who objected to the Treaty of Lisbon and every other treaty before that."
"These are the same shadowy figures who like to hide in the darkness and claim there is a better way, but never say what that better way is; the very same people who never put forward what is best for Irish interests and European interests, but merely something for a small political gain for themselves."
"The reality is that collectively we can achieve greater and better things but also that this requires compromise, understanding and tolerance of the differing viewpoints that will be coming forward."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, EU leaders will meet in Brussels next week and, if the Taoiseach Brian Cowan proposes that Irish support for the Treaty of Lisbon can be secured by agreeing political declarations, or making soothing noises on a selection of issues, he is being deeply misleading."
"The Taoiseach has sought to distract attention from the profound dissatisfaction which the people, not only in Ireland but much more broadly, feel with the direction the EU is heading."
"Opinion polls in Ireland, and indeed the government's own research into the 'no' vote, have outlined people's concerns over workers' rights, public services, militarisation and democracy, and these concerns are shared by millions of workers and families across the Union."
"The economic crisis which faces us demonstrates that now more than ever public services and workers' rights need to be protected from unfettered and unregulated market forces."
"As governments grapple with the crisis, it becomes increasingly clear that the Treaty of Lisbon is obsolete."
"Governments have rediscovered the need for state intervention in the public interest, the need for flexibility and discretion in responding to their people's needs, and they have learnt a costly lesson."
"They have learned that the market is not king."
"It cannot provide all of the solutions, and yet Lisbon seeks the coronation of this failed free-market approach that has brought such havoc in its wake."
"We need a new direction and the truth is that the Treaty of Lisbon does not provide it."
"The Irish Government has failed to bring the debate to other governments; it has failed to seek a better deal, not just for Ireland, but for the whole Union."
"The Irish Government should learn a lesson from its people; it should learn to lead."
"And it must lead the way."
"But all EU leaders bear a responsibility to address, to really address the people's concerns."
"Cynical political manoeuvres and empty rhetoric will not win Irish support for Lisbon, will not address the serious flaws in the Treaty of Lisbon, but above all will not provide the new paths that the EU needs."
"Leaders have a choice."
"They can lead from the hearts and spirits of their peoples, or they can make decisions that are in the interests of the lobbyists and the bureaucrats."
"To the EU leaders I say: make the right choice; listen to Ireland and hear in its voice the echo of France and the Netherlands, the demand for reform, for renewal, the demand for change."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (DA) Madam President, a picture is beginning to emerge of how a putrid compromise is to be reached with Ireland to get it to accept the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I have seen everything here in this House from manipulation to barely concealed threats along the lines of 'Just who do you think will lose a Commissioner, given that we have to implement what it says in the Treaty of Nice about there being fewer Commissioners than Member States?"
"I have heard talk from prominent opinion formers of throwing Ireland out of the Union, including, even, from a newspaper editor in my own country."
"It was decided at the Conference of the Presidents not to submit the decision about Ireland and the Treaty of Lisbon reached in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to a debate and a vote in plenary."
"Nonetheless, the committee concluded in its meeting on Monday that that very decision would form the basis of the President's, and thus Parliament's, official position."
"Parliament, however, cannot have a common position on this issue."
"When the vote about this decision took place, there were 16 in favour and 6 against."
"This, especially given the failure to hold a debate in the Chamber, is a very slender basis on which to produce a common position."
"It is outrageous for democracy to be seen to be brushed aside in this House, the same House in which we are so fond of waving our fingers in the air whilst moralising about countries without democracy and in which we honour those who champion democracy with what we dare to call the Sakharov Prize."
"The way forward for a democratic Europe is not putrid compromises, paltry promises and immoral threats."
"The way forward is a fair and open debate."
"In the few Member States where the establishment has dared to hear what the people think, the answer has been a clear rejection of both the Constitution and the Treaty - a 'no' vote in France, in the Netherlands and in Ireland."
"What more is needed before Parliament wakes up and sees that we are completely out of touch with our electorates?"
"Where are all the cockerels that puff themselves up and threaten the Irish and the Czechs?"
"Do they not dare meet the voters and allow them to be the judges of this vision for Europe?"
"Madam President, whereas the total focus of this summit should be on the economic crisis afflicting us all, sadly much time will be devoted to how to subjugate the democratically expressed will of the Irish electorate."
"The disrespect for the lawfully expressed opinion of a small country on the Treaty of Lisbon is palpable."
"No one would dare try such a juggernaut, Mugabe approach with a large country."
"But the voters of the Republic of Ireland are fair game to be pushed around by the European elite, to whom their precious Lisbon project is more important than the democracy of a nation state."
"It is such arrogance, such intent on browbeating those who thwart their design which has brought the EU to such disconnection with its people."
"This whole unseemly saga has more of the politics of the bully boy about it than of democracy."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Madam President, President of the Commission, Group Chairmen, honourable Members, firstly, I refer to what Mr Daul said and like him I wish to pay tribute to the work which has been done by the Commission, particularly with regard to the strengthening of financial architecture: in fact, there are now four major directives, which were able to be tabled by the Commission and approved by the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers within a very short period of time since September."
"Joseph Daul was absolutely right to highlight this work and also quite right to highlight the need to restore confidence and provide a show of confidence by our attitude."
"This confidence will be found, as several honourable Members have indicated, in unity and coordination."
"I should like to reassure Mr Daul, I know him well, and I know that he is much closer to the values of the social market economy and is not in any way an unbridled capitalist."
"I wish to reassure everybody, the briefest of contact with him would confirm this."
"Therefore, I should like to thank him on this count and also say that we have indeed initiated the institutional road map and that I have seen the concerns he expressed and the concerns of his group in this area."
"I should also like to say to Mr Rasmussen that the aim as regards employment levels of course is at the heart of the French Presidency's concerns, that what he said and which has also been highlighted by other honourable Members, that is to say, that we are aware that with greater coordination we will double or even more than double the added value that we can bring and that with regard to the method, in other words, the launching of specific projects, practical goals and a time frame, we are in agreement with Mr Rasmussen's comments."
"I should also like to assure Mr Graham Watson who has an extremely pragmatic and punctilious turn of mind;"
"Mr Watson quite rightly highlighted the fact that we still need to act quickly."
"I do not think that I need to say it again to the President-in-Office of the Council, but I shall ask him to act even more quickly."
"I do not really think that he has forgotten the need for this rapid action."
"I should like to reassure Mr Watson that the urgency has not disappeared, we are fully aware of it, similarly, as you said, we must not, particularly as regards the battle against climate change, and also Mrs Doyle who is in the Chamber, sacrifice what are long-term demands, as also highlighted by Mrs Harms, in favour of short-term interests, nor must we give in to the self-centeredness expressed by some instead of showing our solidarity, namely for our Central and Eastern European friends, in particular, Poland, the Baltic States and other States, and this issue will also be discussed at the European Council on 11 and 12 December."
"I have told Mrs Harms that we must not backtrack on these goals."
"In no way is it the intention of the Presidency to backtrack on its goals."
"I said that the package from the Commission was consistent, that it contained several goals that had been fixed at the appropriate time, not by the French Presidency, and that these goals will have to be respected."
"This is a moral imperative in the current crisis; we cannot enter into international negotiations believing that it is developing countries that must make all the running."
"We likewise owe a duty of solidarity in this area towards developing countries."
"Regarding the agreement which was reached as part of the trialogue with the European Parliament, for which I thank your House, I believe that it is a balanced agreement and a very precise long-term goal that has been established for cars, and secondly, a progressive and fully incentivising penalty system is in place, which has also been produced for manufacturers, and thirdly, the promotion of green innovations has been included."
"Concerning the financial markets, I refer Mrs Harms to what I said in support of what Mr Daul presently highlighted."
"I welcome Mr Crowley's reference to necessary coordination."
"I understand what he said concerning the initiatives taken by the Irish Government."
"We are in close cooperation and monitoring this very closely, and you can count on the Presidency to demonstrate understanding and tolerance, as you indicated."
"I wish to say to Mrs McDonald that we are familiar with the electoral and social context in Ireland, that we can equally understand Ireland, and that no cynical manoeuvring is involved in all this or in the dialogue we have had with the Irish authorities and that each side is trying to be constructive so that, as highlighted by President Barroso, we can stay on course, a course which, as the crisis clearly demonstrates, is still absolutely necessary with regard to the institutional context and the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I wish to say to Mrs Dahl that we will act in conjunction with Ireland, to whom we of course must show solidarity, but that each side must show responsibility and indeed reassure Mr Allister of the fact that we can take effective action in these various areas."
"To end my speech, as regards what has been said by the various speakers and President Barroso, listening to these debates, I am struck by the overwhelming need to remain unified and demonstrate our solidarity: solidarity and coordination in economic and financial matters; solidarity in the face of the climate threat; solidarity towards the countries experiencing the greatest difficulties in the area of energy security; solidarity also in any defence issues; solidarity also towards developing countries and the South - the direction of the Union for the Mediterranean; solidarity with Ireland but also with a responsibility to find a solution and act so that the Treaty of Lisbon is implemented as soon as possible; solidarity also towards the East and neighbouring Eastern countries, following the Commission's Eastern Partnership initiative, which I am sure will be approved at the next European Council."
"This is what seems to me to be important in our response to the challenges we currently face."
"President of the Commission. - Madam President, just to focus on the point that was most important regarding my statement - the European economic recovery plan - I would like to say thank you for the very broad support for the plan presented by the Commission, namely the statements made by Mr Daul, Mr Rasmussen, Mr Watson, Mr Crowley - thank you very much for your support."
"I am sure that with the very active role of the French Presidency - and here I want to underline the commitment of Jean-Pierre Jouyet - I think we can achieve real progress."
"Mr Rasmussen spoke about ambition and concluded by saying that you share our ambition."
"I thank him for his remarks."
"First of all, I agree that the major point should be employment."
"This is fully compatible with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"I agree that it is by measuring employment that we can some time from now assess how effective our response has been."
"It is a critical, difficult time, a very challenging task."
"As for coordination, you may count on the Commission: we want as much coordination as possible and we have some instruments for that."
"As we have said in our communication, we will ask for a new convergence programme for the Member States in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact and we also have our exercise in the European strategy, that is the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"So with the Lisbon country-specific recommendations - and we are going back to this immediately after the European Council on 18 December - and with the new stability and convergence programmes, we will be sure that Member States will also coordinate the way they implement it."
"But now I am going to be, as always, very frank and open with you."
"You say that you support it."
"Please also support us, the different political families, as well as your political family, when speaking with some of the finance ministers of our governments."
"This is very important."
"It is important to get agreement with our governments in a cross-national, cross-party dimension if we want to succeed."
"This is the question because traditionally, as you know, there is great resistance by Member States to the very idea of coordination."
"When we reviewed the Lisbon Strategy after the Kok report, some Member States completely rejected the very idea of coordination."
"Some time ago, when this crisis was coming, some very important politicians rejected the very idea of a European plan, still less coordination."
"It is fair to say that there is already a consensus about some level of coordination for a recovery plan."
"But there is not yet, to be honest with you, full agreement on the need, for instance, to mobilise unspent money from the European Community budget."
"That was discussed yesterday in the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, without agreement yet being reached."
"There was a very important agreement, but it was on our proposal for an increase in the capital of the European Investment Bank."
"There were also other very important agreements."
"To conclude, I would say that we are in favour of reinforced cooperation, but you know that traditionally there is some resistance."
"My political point is the following: if it is not now in the face of this crisis that we are able to agree on an increased level of coordination, when will it be?"
"That is why I said in my introductory remarks that this is a test for Europe."
"Apart from the important, concrete economic terms of the response, it is also a test for Europe to see whether Europe does indeed wish to translate this level of concern into real coordination for the future."
"This will be the position of the European Commission which I will bring to the European Council."
"One final point regarding smart green growth."
"Yes, that is what we have put in our proposal."
"I thank you for your comments on it."
"We have made very concrete proposals on energy efficiency, on the rapid take-up of green products, on developing clean technologies for cars and construction, precisely because we want to highlight one point: what we are proposing to Member States is not spending just for the sake of spending."
"Spending for the sake of spending is not a solution."
"The important thing is that it is smart spending: spending that responds to the immediate, short-term needs to stimulate demand - for reasons that I think do not need to be demonstrated - but also spending that is a real investment for the future, for our green agenda, for our fight against climate change, for energy efficiency, for inter-connections, for innovation."
"That is what we are proposing: spending that in the short term is not in contradiction with the medium and long term."
"That is the proposal that we will try to get approved in the European Council."
"I really think that we are now much closer to that and I am hopeful that we will have historic decisions at the next European Council meeting."
"Madam President, I am delighted to address this Parliament once more as the recently elected leader of the British Conservative delegation."
"I assure you that in the run-up to the European elections I will strongly argue for the kind of Europe my party wishes to see, as well as being very critical indeed of the socialist Europe which Mr Rasmussen - who has just left us - and his colleagues wish to see in their election manifesto published this week."
"It certainly makes very depressing reading."
"Two of my colleagues were in Mumbai with the trade delegation last week and were in great danger."
"May I put on record not only our condemnation of those atrocities, but also our thanks to the French Presidency in particular, for the prompt action and protection which they afforded to the Members of the European Parliament on that delegation, including my own British colleagues."
"The Council has a full agenda: the economic and financial crisis, the Treaty of Lisbon, climate change and the future of the CAP."
"I will only concern myself with economic issues now."
"In the United Kingdom, the government has announced the largest level of borrowing in our history."
"Our Chancellor will double the national debt to GBP 1 trillion in the next five years."
"He has also announced giveaways of GBP 20 billion, while taking back GBP 40 billion in higher taxes."
"His so-called fiscal stimulus will ensure that our recession - as the Commission has rightly said - will be the longest and deepest of any in the EU."
"Only in countries with healthy public finances can a stimulus of the kind announced be of assistance."
"In the case of the UK, we are now saddled with massive borrowing for the foreseeable future."
"Last week we had details of the Commission's important recovery plan, which I believe contains some very positive items, but I fear that this initiative alone may not deal with the immediate problems."
"The focus should be to get the banks to lend to each other and to businesses and ordinary people."
"With unemployment set to soar, we must build confidence, not leave a legacy of debt and higher taxes for our children and grandchildren to contend with."
"(DE) Madam President, unlike Mr Kirkhope, I should like to say that the election manifesto from Madrid is a document of hope and a signal that there are ways out of the crisis, which we must support with all our strength."
"Parliament supports the French Presidency at the summit next week in finally obtaining clarity regarding ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We cannot go into the European elections with uncertainty about whether this treaty is coming or not."
"That would be an invitation to all Europe's opponents to take undue advantage of these elections for a show fight, for the For and Against regarding a treaty which has already been ratified by 25 States."
"For this reason the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has drawn up a resolution in which we are called upon to make every effort to obtain ratification, perhaps even before the elections."
"We must finally obtain clarity at the summit."
"This must not be postponed until next year."
"Madam Vice-President, there will be a second referendum in Ireland."
"Our statement, Communication in Partnership, is a test case for whether we can inform the people."
"We must not leave it to Europe's opponents."
"Madam President, with respect to the Treaty, I believe we are making some progress at last."
"The Czech Court and the Irish Parliament have comprehensively and decisively blunted the attack upon the Treaty from the nationalist and reactionary forces."
"The distinguished representation of Sinn Féin has of course departed, but I speak on this question not as a lobbyist or a bureaucrat but as a democrat."
"It is now up to the Czech Parliament and the Irish Government to take the next decisive steps."
"We need a clear pledge from the Taoiseach that he is to hold a second referendum at a specific time and we need a more professional campaign plan."
"The Parliament here appeals to the profound generosity of the Irish people and to their sharp intelligence to see the seriousness of the consequences of a second 'no'."
"(PL) Madam President, Poland has done a lot towards finding a compromise on the climate change package."
"We suggested changing the base year and including CO2 absorbed by forests in the balance."
"Today, we wish to propose a system based on best technology benchmarks and on the exclusion of some vulnerable industries from the auction system."
"The next move is up to the Presidency."
"Since we were able to find a solution for the German motor industry, why can not we find one for Central European countries?"
"Our country cannot agree to an apparent compromise which simply slows down Poland's progress towards the auction system."
"We cannot agree to hypothetical climate change objectives being achieved at the cost of increased energy prices, by transferring power generation and cement, metal and glass production to outside the Union, so that the aims would be achieved at the cost of slower economic development and mass redundancies."
"No one in Poland could agree to that."
"The government could not and the opposition could not either."
"Madam President, the modern world economy is based on a gigantic pyramid of debts: the debts of states, banks, corporations and companies."
"The debts are interrelated with one another."
"The structural defects of the economic system we have been experiencing and the market economy system that is distorted are basically combined with a money credit system."
"The defective functioning of the economy results from linking the system of creating money with credit."
"Maurice Allais compared it to a cancer which relentlessly eats away the capitalist economy."
"This system provides for the creation of the purchasing power with no real equivalent."
"Serious reforms of the banking and financial systems need therefore to be implemented."
"The tax system needs to be reformed and the way that stock exchanges work needs to be changed as well."
"As regards the plan to patch up gaps in the financial crunch by means of money injections - they are apparently going on in my country too - I think one may put it where the moon does not shine."
"- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the government leaders of the various countries of the Union will next week reject the Commission's proposal for a unified response to the economic crisis."
"Spending EUR 200 billion of taxpayers' money centrally on green investments and innovations is no cure for 27 different economies."
"It is also no cure to increase or cut taxes centrally and to regulate the size of budget deficits and government guarantees."
"I firmly believe that the Member States must cooperate but that they should determine their own specific measures according to the situation they find themselves in, rather than having them dictated by Brussels."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Council should also refuse to pressure the Member States into completing the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It should recognise that the Treaty is not dead because of the Irish."
"I fear that the Treaty of Lisbon could change the Europe of today into a place of conflict, betrayal and division."
"This is because it gives the great powers a legal cudgel with which to beat the smaller nations and this can lead only to violence, war and poverty."
"The Treaty of Lisbon thus threatens the existence of the European Union as an enterprise for freedom, prosperity and peace."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficulties in evacuating European citizens from Mumbai have revealed the necessity for closer coordination in matters of security and defence in the European Union."
"Cooperation with the Council has gone very well in recent months."
"Cooperation with the French Presidency and the Council was very fruitful."
"The central event was undoubtedly the crisis in Georgia."
"Here the Presidency of the Council acted quickly."
"It negotiated a ceasefire and ensured that observers arrived in Georgia in good time, and the European Union was at the centre of events."
"On the same occasion, nonetheless, shortcomings were also revealed."
"We saw that our Brussels instruments for crisis management had really reached the limit of their capability on this occasion."
"It is quite clear that we must further improve both the capabilities of the European Union in preventive analysis and the instruments of crisis management."
"As we know, the European Union is currently involved in revising the security strategy by the end of this year."
"This security strategy has proved its worth."
"The principles must be retained."
"There are individual items which must be amended and tailored to more recent realities."
"However, even more important than adapting the security strategy is the implementation of this security strategy."
"We are therefore requesting the preparation of a White Paper on Security and Defence in the European Parliament."
"Perhaps the French White Paper which has been drawn up on this topic might serve as a model, for here we need a very broad debate on the preparation of this White Paper - a public debate on these matters of European security."
"For European security is not a matter that should only be decided behind closed doors - this is a matter which concerns all citizens."
"Madam President, there is an overwhelming desire in Ireland to remain at the heart of European affairs and to ensure that Europe can act effectively and transparently in the interests of the Member States."
"This is particularly so, and more important than ever, in the current financial and economic crisis."
"Irish citizens, however, need assurances that the 'no' camp's misleading claims concerning the Treaty of Lisbon on the Commission, on abortion, on conscription, on military neutrality, on workers' rights and on public services have no basis in fact."
"To significantly enhance the possibility of ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon a decision needs to be made by the Heads of State that, once the Treaty of Lisbon is in place, its mechanism will be used to make certain that all Member States will recover the right to nominate a Commissioner without restriction."
"A simple extension of that right from 2014 to 2019 will not, in my view, be sufficient to ensure ratification in Ireland."
"In addition, a commitment to add a social clause on labour rights to the Posting of Workers Directive, similar to the clause added to the Services Directive, would go a long way to address the dangers that arise from the Laval, Viking and Rüffert judgments, which were also a cause of concern in Ireland."
"I would urge the Council and the Commission to address these matters urgently at the coming summit."
"(PL) Madam President, the package of anti-crisis measures adopted by the Commission and by the various Member States will destroy the Stability Pact."
"I was pleased by its proposed review, but it is important to ensure that the new pact does not quickly become yet another fiction and yet another reason for undoubted embarrassment."
"At the same time, while amending the Stability Pact, ought we not to review the criteria for eurozone membership?"
"Some states base their hopes for currency stabilisation on this measure, fearing a repetition of the recent speculative attacks on their currencies."
"Another issue: in a situation where aid to various industries under the pact is being sanctioned, how should we view the European Union's severity towards the problem of the Polish shipyards?"
"Finally: can it really be that where CO2 emissions are concerned it will prove impossible to find a solution which will ensure that Poland will not have to import cheap electricity from Ukraine and Russia?"
"(LV) Ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank the European Commission for the economic recovery plan and to express the hope that it will be used not to support unsuccessful bankers, and their pay, but that there will be real support for business."
"Our business people are working in perhaps the most difficult of circumstances, since they find themselves hemmed in by a huge amount of bureaucracy."
"Now, in the same way that we are carrying out a health check on the common agricultural policy, we ought also to carry out a health check on directives and regulations, to see whether there are not too many bureaucratic obstacles for our businesses, and whether the implementation of these regulations and directives in the Member States has not become too bureaucratic."
"It is only our business people who can get us out of the crisis."
"So, a health check should be carried out 'line by line'."
"In relation to climate change I really support the contention about flexibility in the sphere of emissions policy, since, for example, my country achieved and exceeded the 20% target for the use of renewable energy sources some time ago."
"I would not like to see my country, which very much needs economic development, having additional hurdles imposed upon it."
"(SK) Despite the fact that time-wise the second half of the year is not the most ideal, during their Presidency of the Union, the French have proven that they are justifiably considered a leader and driving force of the Union."
"I have been a Member of the European Parliament for four and a half years."
"I can positively say that France has had the most active approach to resolving the problems of all 27 Member States of the Union."
"The historic change brought about by electing the charismatic and very active President Sarkozy is indisputably positive."
"His abilities were also demonstrated in his immediate response to the problem of Russia and Georgia."
"The financial crisis also erupted in that period, to which the French promptly responded by proclaiming the need for a systemic solution and revision of the Union's control and financial mechanisms, including from the global standpoint."
"It was during the French Presidency that the European Union earned the reputation of an active player in world politics, when the G8 and G20 summits were convened upon the initiative of the French President and President Barroso."
"I believe that the forthcoming European Council meeting will be successful and that all European institutions will proceed jointly."
"Madam President, at the request of the Council and responding to the expectations of Parliament, the Commission has prepared and revealed today a document on the Eastern Partnership which will be presented to the summit, as stated by Minister Jouyet, President-in-Office."
"I wish to congratulate and praise the Commission for this document."
"The idea of deepening relations with our eastern neighbours has been pioneered and championed by Parliament for quite some time."
"We need a strong EU presence in the eastern neighbourhood, in synergy with our Mediterranean neighbourhood."
"For the sake of stability on our doorstep, we should offer tangible prospects to our closest neighbours."
"Therefore we should support the idea of establishing an enhanced partnership covering essentially five areas: association agreements, a multilateral framework for cooperation, a comprehensive and deep free-trade area, visa liberalisation leading to visa-free travel and, last but not least, energy security."
"I especially welcome the proposal to increase the EU financial assistance earmarked for the ENP East."
"Two years ago we in Parliament came up with the idea of strengthening the parliamentary dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy East; our proposal intends to set up a joint parliamentary assembly comprising members of the European Parliament and deputies of the parliaments of the six countries."
"Such a forum would provide an excellent platform for us in engaging our partners, but also for our partners to engage with each other."
"We, the Union, need friends around us, but also for them to be friends among themselves."
"Therefore I am especially glad at the idea of convening a Euronest - an assembly - which, if taken up by the Commission, will provide an instrument for democratic and parliamentary scrutiny of eastern partnership projects."
"I believe that the eastern partnership project constitutes not only a new enhanced format but also will strengthen the Union both internally and externally."
"Expanding and upgrading relations, political and economic, with our eastern neighbours will contribute to our economic dynamics and political and international influence."
"(SV) Madam President, the most important task facing European politicians in the years ahead is to safeguard employment and welfare."
"We have some good years behind us, but we are now seeing unemployment increasing at a rapid rate."
"I share the Commission's opinion on the need for coordinated efforts and for linking the short-term commitments and efforts with the long-term commitments."
"I also support Mr Rasmussen's proposal for clear goals in order to maintain employment."
"Where short-term efforts are concerned, it is important that consumers have confidence in the economy."
"Above all, we must protect those who are worst placed and their consumption."
"As far as the more long-term solutions are concerned, it is important not only to bring forward investments that would have been made anyway in a more environmentally sound infrastructure and environmentally sound building, but also those which develop the skills of wage-earners, so that we are in a strong position in the future."
"We must combine our instruments at European level with coordinated efforts in the Member States."
"We must not do as some suggest - namely do too little - because we then risk having not just higher budget deficits, but also higher unemployment and poorer welfare."
"We must act quickly and with sufficient force."
"(PL) Madam President, the topics to be discussed at the forthcoming European Council meeting include the climate change package."
"Carbon dioxide emission and all issues associated with so-called global warming are becoming more and more like an ideology."
"All of us care for clean air and the natural environment."
"However, research has shown that human impact on climate change is negligible."
"If it is true that human activity is responsible for as little as 4% of global CO2 emissions, and that the European Union's share of that amount is 15%, this would mean that we want to spend hundreds of billions of euros to reduce global CO2 emissions by less than 0.5%, while they are being increased by countries such as India and China."
"It is hard to believe that the Union's decision-makers are unable to appreciate these implications."
"It is probably no accident that some countries, such as for instance France, will sell their CO2 emission allowances to others."
"The result of this action is foreseeable: within a short time the sellers will in practice take over inter alia Polish power stations."
"In this context we need to redefine the meaning of solidarity in Europe."
"Madam President, the forthcoming summit has many serious issues to deal with, not least a coordinated EU-wide response to the global challenge of the serious economic downturn."
"This comes on the back of a major crisis of confidence in our banking systems, due to their failure to sustain the acceptable level of liquidity required to underpin day-to-day commercial and industrial business operations in all our Member States."
"So millions of viable jobs and thousands of solid businesses are in danger of going under as we speak."
"Yes, we must mobilise all European institutions to respond to the crisis and - as the Commission's recovery plan says - this crisis occurs on the eve of a major structural shift towards the low-carbon economy, with major new economic opportunities and, indeed, serious first-mover advantages."
"This brings me to the summit discussion on the climate and energy package, on which we will have a long discussion tomorrow, so I will limit myself to just one point. That is to underscore the importance of full respect for the codecision process between Council and Parliament, to emphasise that any political agreement on outstanding issues - issues between square brackets - discussed and decided on by Heads of State and Government at the summit will have to be presented as compromise amendments to subsequent trialogues by the ever hard-working French Presidency and may or may not be agreed by the Parliament."
"We will sign off and, while I fully support the objective of first-reading agreement, please be warned that it will not be at any price."
"Now to the Treaty of Lisbon item."
"Yes, we have had time to digest and analyse the 12 June vote, but no, Minister Jouyet, we will not - and should not even attempt to - ratify again at the beginning of next year, or we risk failure again with our deeply unpopular government."
"Do not hold your breath in expecting our Taoiseach's road map - that is, if you get one - to announce a date for a referendum."
"I have sat and listened here today to cynical lectures from Sinn Féin on the risk of militarisation lurking in the Treaty of Lisbon's small print and to Mr Allister's faux concerns for the Irish electorate - more examples of the level of intellectual dishonesty to which the Irish electorate is subject."
"Yet there is a constituency of genuine concern."
"I thank the French Presidency for its offer of all assistance with legal guarantees and any assurances that may be required."
"I thank all Members and you, Madam President, for your understanding as we continue to trespass on your patience."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, I thank the French Presidency for its successes and wish it luck at the Summit."
"At the start of its Presidency France did not know that a world financial crisis would erupt and that this crisis would become its greatest challenge."
"I respect the response by France and the European Union response to the crisis."
"As to the other topic to be discussed at the Summit, namely climate change, I am glad that the French Presidency understands, and I hope that it will take into account, the difficulties some states will have with quickly doing away with the use of coal for power generation."
"The fact that the world climate conference is being held in Poznań demonstrates Poland's willingness to participate in the process of reducing carbon emissions."
"We do however need time to change our energy management systems and are counting on the solidarity of the entire European Union on this matter."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take a different approach."
"The summit will take place in a phase of growing confidence among citizens in the European Union."
"More than two thirds of the Austrian population - although they are not alone - are of the opinion that we can manage the crisis with the assistance of the European Union only - and that means together."
"Awareness of the importance of the common currency, the euro, is growing not only in the eurozone, but above all outside."
"People feel that only as the continent of Europe together do we play a role and have a chance in the world."
"The reduction in energy dependence, the commitment to combating climate change, the management of the financial crisis, the creation of a trustworthy defence, security and foreign policy require increased European togetherness, resolve and capacity to act."
"If we take advantage of this opportunity, we will meet the expectations of citizens responsibly."
"Let us find the common roadmap for ratification of the Reform Treaty."
"Let us create coherent, efficient, professional legislation in response to the financial crisis."
"Let us find European regulators, based on the model of the European Central Bank."
"Let us show how a social market economy operates responsibly as a European regulatory framework in the field of climate protection."
"We not only have a crisis or many building sites, we also have an opportunity."
"Let us take advantage of it, let us learn from the mistakes of the past."
"A lot we knew, and acted too little and too late."
"The time has come to venture a new start with the citizens of Europe."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis which we are discussing is like a tsunami: severe and devastating."
"So far, it has caused the collapse of the financial markets and undermined the foundations of the real economy."
"The provision of a total of EUR 200 billion, finalised at the EU summits, seems, in my humble opinion, to be completely inadequate."
"This figure amounts to less than the sums lost by Europe's stock markets in a single of those many days when they closed with a sharp deficit."
"We need to be bolder, more courageous, more European."
"I am in favour, with my group's consent, and President Barroso has already been directly authorised to do this, of Member States relying on their own reserves, holding in return a European bond to be traded on the markets."
"They will be obliged however to invest the same amount in infrastructures and in policies for supporting those experiencing social hardship and the production system."
"These bonds, which will be pegged to the value of the states' reserves, should generate confidence and help to acquire the required level of liquidity - 2-5 percentage points of GDP - to be able to pursue the policies which we all agree are needed."
"All of this is carried out outside the Maastricht Treaty, along with an appropriate recovery plan."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this financial crisis is certainly unprecedented; however, in my view, this could have been and ought to have been predicted and avoided."
"The economic crisis, as previously described by President Barroso, has been 'sudden and unexpected'."
"Please allow me, President Barroso, to disagree."
"The economic crisis has been sudden, but all the signs were there to see, starting with the indications from the International Monetary Fund in spring 2007."
"Now, however, the language being used by the President-in-Office of the Council and by President Barroso is more appropriate and, in my humble opinion, completely mindful of the gravity of the situation."
"I agree with Mr Karas."
"Europe's citizens are looking to us and we need to take action."
"The European plan which you, Commissioner, have drawn up for EUR 200 billion is, I must say, inadequate."
"We need to be clear here."
"Perhaps that was all you could do, but it is inadequate."
"I believe that the issue you need to deal with is about having additional, separate resources, by borrowing, at this exceptional time, directly from the market."
"Let us also mention the European Central Bank for a moment."
"There is a lot of reticence about discussing this institution, but let us avoid going into the reasons behind this."
"In my opinion, the European Central Bank should cut the interest rate tomorrow by one percentage point."
"If it only makes a cut of half a point, it will disappoint the markets yet again."
"Its job - as you on the Commission have and everyone else has said - is to keep prices stable."
"But I imagine that this result can also be achieved without making the action taken on interest rates follow the inflation index; sometimes there needs to be more flexibility and anticipation of the action taken."
"I agree with President Barroso on keeping spending tight."
"We need to move in this direction in the European institutions and the Member States, including ourselves in the European Parliament."
"Perhaps we need to equip ourselves to give more support to the courage which the Commission is currently demonstrating."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the French Presidency of the Council for having pointed out and solved many problems during difficult times in recent months."
"However, we know that the ability to act is also heavily dependent on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Here we see that there is a report from both the Irish Parliaments."
"You, Mr President, have stated that it is a very responsible, far-sighted and intelligent report which includes concerns but also shows ways in which we Europeans can solve this problem together."
"I should like to invite the French Presidency to undertake the development of a roadmap which makes it possible to include and take seriously the Irish positions and concerns which have nothing to do with the Treaty, such as the question of commissioners, but also ways out of the democratic deficit which they themselves wish to remedy by means of better relations between Parliament and government in Ireland."
"On this basis we have an opportunity to ratify this Treaty if we follow the path which the Irish Parliament has quite clearly indicated."
"I think that we should take this path to encourage our Irish friends and that, in doing so, we should have a schedule in mind to avoid the possibility of us falling behind as a result of the British elections being brought forward."
"The financial crisis clearly shows that more and more citizens are recognising that Europe is indispensable, as the French Presidency of the Council has proved in Georgia and in the financial crisis."
"Mr President, earlier Minister Jouyet made a reference to the Mumbai terrorist attack, demonstrating solidarity with India."
"I sincerely welcome this."
"However, warm words need to be backed by action."
"Given the massive increase in loss of life due to terrorist attacks across the world, where innocent people from east, west, north and south are increasingly targets, I believe it is remiss of the Council not to put this issue on the agenda of next week's Council meeting."
"It is no less important an issue than all the other issues that we are discussing."
"The US is acting but Europe not."
"As we speak, Condoleezza Rice is over there, but where is Javier Solana?"
"Tensions are increasing between two nuclear states."
"Europe should and could do more, especially by looking at agreements such as its strategic partnership with India and by adequately resourcing the sentiments expressed there, so they can be achieved and realised."
"(FI) Mr President, the summit is to consider how the Treaty of Lisbon should be implemented."
"One key to the solution would be that each Member State should have its own Commissioner."
"I hope that this will be something that is taken into serious consideration and is accomplished."
"During the French Presidency France could hardly object to the idea on the basis that the Commission would be too big, when we know that 37 ministers currently sit in the French Government."
"The notion that the Commission will be too big if each Member State has a Commissioner has never been sustainable."
"In my opinion, it would bring the Member States closer and increase legitimacy, and I would hope that people will see sense on this and reverse earlier decisions, especially since they were not entirely rational."
"(PL) Mr President, from the date when the Kyoto Protocol was signed, Poland has reduced its carbon emissions by 33%."
"During the same period, other European Union countries increased their emission levels, in spite of the fact that their power generation industries are not predominantly coal-based."
"For this reason, the attempt to set the date from which emission levels would be measured later than the date of signing the Kyoto Protocol demonstrates how unfairly the problem is being dealt with."
"At the same time, mitigating the impact of the financial crisis by depriving 80 000 Polish shipyard workers of their jobs is a truly extraordinary idea."
"I still hope that the Commission will reverse this decision, which is so unreasonable in the current conditions."
"Mr President, apologies that my voice is not particularly good, although it is maybe just as well."
"I might have got angry with some of the comments from my colleague from Sinn Féin in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Let me just say that in Ireland we put the cart before the horse."
"We are actually having a very good debate about the Treaty of Lisbon since the vote."
"Would it had been the other way around!"
"There is now some logic and sense being talked about it in Ireland."
"And can I say to the battered bureaucrats and lobbyists that I have decided that you are some of the best thing we have."
"Honestly you should bite back, because it is ironic that Sinn Féin should talk about public services, which are run by bureaucrats, and yet condemn the very bureaucrats of these institutions."
"We wait to see what the Irish Government says next week."
"It does not have much public confidence at the moment, so it may not be the best of times to talk about another vote if that is what has to happen."
"But I believe that there is sense prevailing in Ireland and that people are now reflecting on the situation we find ourselves in and now know that we need to be at the heart of Europe, given the crisis that we are in."
"Mr President, in a situation where 25 or 26 countries have said 'yes' to the Treaty of Lisbon and just one has said 'no', it is not unreasonable, nor indeed undemocratic, to ask whether the one is willing to reconsider, but provided the rest of us are willing to meet the concerns that were expressed when they voted 'no'."
"That is not to ignore the result of the Irish referendum; it is to respond to the result of the Irish referendum, look at the concerns that were expressed and try to meet them."
"But that of course requires Ireland to tell us, to tell the other countries, exactly what concerns were expressed; to define a list of demands that we can then respond to or at least negotiate on."
"The solution of course has to be acceptable to all 27 countries."
"Preferably that means not renegotiating the whole Treaty but interpreting it, clarifying it, adjusting the way it could be implemented to meet the concerns."
"I for one am confident that can be done but it requires a first step from Ireland."
"I am glad that the Irish Parliament has taken the initiative on this, instead of leaving it to the government."
"(RO) Mr President, parliamentary elections have just taken place in Romania and I can assure you that the government which is going to be formed will pursue a sound economic policy."
"I would like to thank the French Presidency and the European Commission for the way in which they have acted swiftly and skilfully in responding to the problems caused by the global economic and financial crisis."
"I would have liked more to have been said in the package of measures about the Member States which are not part of the euro zone and about how to access liquidity in an emergency."
"(RO) Lifting the barriers preventing the free movement of workers guarantees proper, decent working conditions for all European workers and provides an effective means of combating social dumping and tax evasion."
"I would urge a special item to be added to the European Council's agenda on lifting the barriers preventing the free movement of Romanian and Bulgarian workers."
"I feel that two years on since both countries have joined, this step has become necessary, especially against the background of the economic and financial crisis."
"Similarly, energy security and the energy and climate change package need to be included on the European Council's agenda."
"It is not a case of Europe having to produce less, but simply in a more environmentally friendly and efficient manner."
"For this reason, Member States need to be supported in making substantial investments aimed at modernising installations in the industries heavily involved in the energy sector, boosting productivity and developing the transport infrastructure."
"Mr President, Madame Vice-President, Commissioner, honourable Members, the debate has covered three key points, which I shall come back to, but first of all, I wish to thank Mr von Wogau and Mr Kirkhope, who thanked the French Presidency for what was done for the European citizens caught up in the Mumbai tragedy."
"We have worked hard with the Secretariat General of the European Parliament with regard to your representatives and the Government officials who were there, but I have to say, as has been highlighted several times, we must continue to work on better coordination between consulates and local diplomatic services in this type of crisis, in what is happening for that matter in Thailand at the moment."
"We have managed to do this, and we must carry on doing it. I was at Roissy Airport when the plane from Mumbai landed, and I could see that all the same eleven European nationalities were represented on the chartered plane."
"I would also like to reiterate what Mrs Gill and Mr von Wogau have said, that Europe must indeed be present, must do more with regards to these terrorist hazards in that region of the world as in other regions."
"And this raises a problem not referred to during the debate but which will be discussed at the European Council, of the European Security Strategy."
"We must adapt and update this strategy to meet the terrorist threat, respond to cybercrime, respond to new dangers."
"We must also improve - and I am pleased that Mrs Gill asked this question - our systems in terms of planning and the conduct of civil and military operations, at European level."
"These aspects of European security and defence policy are, as you well know, important, and the French Presidency wishes to ensure that we can make progress in this area and that a clear direction can be taken in this area also before the year is out."
"I now come back to what has been said about the institutional problems and the Treaty."
"I heard and I thank Mrs Doyle and Mrs McGuinness for their speeches, which were extremely clear and imbued with a sense of responsibility."
"I also heard Mr Brok, Mr Corbett, Mr von Wogau, Mr Duff and Jo Leinen on this issue."
"Firstly: I think that we are making progress."
"We are making progress by taking the Irish requests seriously, and I address this remark to Mrs Doyle and Mrs McGuiness."
"We understand them and we also understand the Irish political situation that has been created in the Irish Parliament, and what efforts are being made on this difficult path."
"We can clearly see this."
"Each, however, must demonstrate their sense of responsibility."
"We shall demonstrate this, we shall propose a balanced solution that will enable us to move forward and progress together, and I say together, towards the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon, when the time is right, but I fully understand the timetable constraints of our Irish friends."
"These constraints should be respected - there are also political deadlines - and taken into consideration."
"Jo Leinen highlighted this fact."
"Greater communication is needed, we should be closer to the ground, which is what we are doing with Mrs Wallström who is more competent than I am in this area, but who has made great efforts."
"We have reached an agreement on the communication policy strategy with your Parliament, between the Council and the Commission, and Mrs Wallström has also developed a strategy, which, as I saw in Dublin, was warmly welcomed by everyone."
"It is true that what is needed in this area is to demonstrate more effort, including in terms of communication."
"With regard to everything that has been said, in particular by our Polish friends, in relation to the climate and energy package, we obviously have to take account of the specific situation, as I have said, of those countries with more problematic energy structures, in order to meet the targets."
"We must retain these targets."
"I think that means are available that will allow for the necessary flexibility so that specific situations and the requests made by our Polish friends can be taken on board."
"The French Presidency is doing everything in its power to achieve the necessary compromises, while retaining these targets, but rest assured that we are taking on board the specific characteristics of Poland, other Central and Eastern European countries and the Baltic States and their requests in the area of energy security."
"I wish to say to Mrs Doyle, who also highlighted this fact in her speech, that as she is aware, codecision-making is actually a key concern of the French Presidency."
"The Council and the European Parliament have instigated a negotiation procedure, a trialogue, which, for the past month has been developed as the result of a large investment made, and the results of this trialogue - as Mrs Doyle is well aware - represent virtually 90% of the package. Now, all that remains before us is the last home stretch, the final 10% of the problems referred to by several honourable Members during these debates."
"With regard to the economic and financial crisis, what has been said seems to me important, and as has already been stated, the feeling of urgency is shared by the Council and the Commission."
"What I would like to say, I would like to thank Mr Pirilli for his original ideas on the use of reserves, to say to Mr Bonsignore, that the plan also depends on what is available at the level of Community instruments."
"Constructing a plan would be to ignore the competences at Community level, the existing instruments and the available budget, and so cannot be done."
"That is as far as we can go."
"On the other hand, I think that the European Central Bank has been responsive and has acted well."
"In fact, a signal on rates is currently expected."
"We shall see what the decision of the European Central Bank is."
"All this is welcome, and I will not make any further comment."
"Mr Karas was perfectly right to highlight - and Austria is a perfect example of this - that we also have to be able to seize the opportunities associated with the crisis, that the euro - and this has been confirmed, and Commissioner Almunia knows better than I do - that the feeling of belonging to the European Union - particularly in a country such as yours, I have been struck by this - has been transformed and changed as a result of this economic and financial crisis, and the fact that the euro, for countries both inside and outside the euro zone, has become a benchmark and a symbol, which is very encouraging."
"I should like to say to Mrs Belohorská that everything you have said will be accurately reported to President Sarkozy, and I should like to thank her for what she has said concerning the French Presidency and its actions, and finally to say to Mr Wolski, that everything relating to our neighbours is important, and we shall discuss the Eastern Partnership Proposal, which is an excellent proposal produced by the European Commission, at the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs on Monday, at the 'External Relations' Council, and, of course, at the European Council."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank all the contributors for your very constructive, relevant and interesting comments."
"There are two specific questions that I would like to answer initially and then perhaps I will focus on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mr Jouyet has already mentioned the fact - and this is in response to Mr von Wogau - that the Council will adopt the report on five years of the European Security Strategy."
"May I add to what Mr Jouyet said: of course the Treaty of Lisbon would also help by greatly strengthening and simplifying the institutional structure in this area."
"This will be an opportunity for the Council to look at how to help guarantee the coherence of all our instruments and the balance between hard and soft security."
"That was in response to Mr von Wogau."
"Mr Bernard Wojciechowski asked about the Eastern Partnership."
"We can report from today's Commission meeting that we adopted a proposal on the Eastern Partnership, including a reinforced financing of activities, which covers economic integration, mobility issues, social and economic development policy, cooperation platforms, free trade and student mobility - all of these elements that are in this Eastern Partnership."
"I welcome the fact that we have now discussed and adopted such a plan."
"This debate has shown that this is an important moment for the European Union."
"It has illustrated the whole concept of sustainability."
"Sustainable development means that we cannot put ourselves in debt and then ask future generations to come up with a solution."
"We cannot send problems with regard to pollution, waste and environmental or climate change to future generations to solve for us."
"We cannot create social problems for the next generation to sort out for us."
"The whole definition of sustainable development is the fact that we have to look at ways to satisfy our needs in a way that does not impact on future generations and their wish to satisfy their needs."
"We have three central and linked issues to resolve in the next month - which have clearly come to the fore: the Economic Recovery Plan, where decisive EU action can have a real impact on Europe's social and economic well-being over the coming year; the climate and energy package, which will put Europe on track to lead the world in defining a credible, achievable path to a low-carbon future; and the Treaty of Lisbon, where we need to set out the way forward to achieving a Treaty so that Europeans can enjoy the benefits of a more democratic and efficient European Union."
"I fully trust my colleagues Commissioner Almunia and Commissioner Dimas to discuss the Recovery Plan - as so many of you have commented on that - and the climate/energy package in more detail."
"I understand that will happen later today and tomorrow morning, so I will make just a few more comments about the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I think that these two issues are a perfect illustration of why we need the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Climate change and the economic crisis require a European Union that can make the right decisions quickly, efficiently and democratically."
"If Europe is to do the 'heavy lifting' to deliver such fundamental change, it needs the right tools to do that job."
"The commitment of this Parliament and of the Commission to the Treaty of Lisbon has always been clear."
"We wanted a real step forward for Europe, more powers for this directly elected Parliament."
"For national parliaments, we wanted a greater say for citizens, streamlined institutions and more clarity on who does what in Europe."
"Delaying all of this is of course a disappointment, but it should not distract us from the central objective of seeing the Treaty of Lisbon in force."
"That means that we hope to be able to pursue the goal of full ratification and it means winning the case in Ireland."
"I was in Ireland myself last month and tried to explain why I think we need the Treaty."
"I also set out to understand why Irish voters had reservations."
"What I heard was very much in tune with the polling evidence that we have seen."
"On some issues - like taxation and defence issues - voters had concerns with no real basis in the Treaty."
"On others, like the issue of the Irish Commissioner, they took a worst-case scenario arising from the implementation of the Treaty."
"Many felt that information was insufficient or unclear and that a 'no' vote was seen as the safest option."
"The excellent report that we have now received from the Irish Parliament's special sub-committee makes a very important contribution to clarifying these concerns and also outlining possible options for resolving them."
"When asked, I told them that my impression was that there was a lot of goodwill around Europe to help to address the concerns of the Irish."
"The Commission intends to do what it can to work with the Parliament and the Irish authorities to improve communication on Europe in Ireland."
"We are working on a memorandum of understanding to make sure that we can start doing this immediately, with the Government and with the people in Ireland."
"However, I also made it clear that my impression from talking to different Member States was that there was no appetite for re-opening an institutional settlement that has taken seven years of long and arduous negotiations to reach a compromise, and that the 25 Member States that have now ratified the Treaty, many of whom had previously ratified the Constitution - and two by referendums, remember - are not going to want to start that process again."
"With the European Parliament elections coming up, it is time that we stopped talking about institutions and started talking about EU policies which matter to citizens and how to solve these big challenges and problems."
"Next week's European Council should give us a clear road map to take this process forward with a sense of urgency."
"I am confident that it will provide the collective impetus necessary to achieving full ratification of the Treaty."
"We will try to contribute to this in the best way we can as a Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PT) The leaders of the European Union are not accepting the popular vote in the only referendum that it was possible to hold - because it was required by their own national constitution - on the draft Treaty of Lisbon in which the people repeated the NO decision that the peoples of France and the Netherlands had already made regarding the European Constitution."
"Once again, in an attitude that is anti-democratic and shows a complete disregard for the voting of the citizens, we see the return of pressure and blackmail to attempt to force Ireland to hold a new referendum or - even worse - to change its own national constitution to avoid referenda and the popular vote."
"We reaffirm our most strident protests against this position."
"These policies must be scrapped as a matter of urgency."
"We want a new direction for Portugal and for Europe that prioritises people, the improvement of collective well-being and respect for the dignity of those who produce wealth."
"This new direction must reject what President Sarkozy calls recasting capitalism and must say no to the policy of Economic and Monetary Union, along with the associated Stability Pact and false autonomy of the European Central Bank (ECB)."
"This will not happen under the socalled 'European Economic Recovery Plan'."
"in writing. - (PT) The upcoming European Council will constitute another stage in the unacceptable process of imposing a draft treaty, already rejected three times by the peoples of Europe."
"Instead of respecting the will of the French, Dutch and Irish peoples, the institutions of the European Union (European Parliament, Council and Commission) have demonstrated that its true character is anti-democratic by insisting on continuing the process of (parliamentary) ratification of the draft treaty (which has so far only not been completed by Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic) whilst always avoiding holding referenda (such as the one that took place recently in Sweden) 'like the plague'."
"Big business in Europe and the executors of its policies - the right and the social democrats - disregard the independently and democratically expressed will of the Irish people, who they are seeking to 'isolate' so as to be better able to pressure and blackmail them and impose the holding of a new referendum, just as they did with the Treaty of Nice."
"Look no further than the unacceptable motion for a resolution of 17 November 2008 of the Committee on (so-called) Constitutional Affairs of the EP, which 'reiterates and confirms its endorsement of the Treaty' (as if it had the authority to do this ...) and 'the need for its ratification in the Member States ... as soon as possible'."
"The EU is showing its true colours!"
"in writing. - I would like to remind the Council and also the Commission that the EU is based on the basic values, such as democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights."
"Therefore I condemn strongly the spirit in which the recent EU-Russia summit in Nice was held."
"It is not acceptable that business as usual will start again with the argument that there is no alternative."
"Mainstreaming human rights in its external policies and respect for the rule of law are the cornerstones in any relations with third countries."
"Russia cannot be an exception, in particular in the light of the fact that it has not fulfilled all the conditions laid down in the agreement after the aggression towards Georgia."
"I am concerned that the EU will lose respect as a serious and independent actor in international affairs."
"Furthermore, EU hesitancy to set clear limits on such a pre-planned violation of the norms of international conduct is likely to encourage similar aggression from the Russian side in the future."
"Therefore I strongly call on the Commission and Council to seriously reconsider their decision to continue with business as usual."
"I would like to refer to the recent communication issued by the Commission concerning the EU economic recovery plan."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of certain provisions in this plan, particularly those relating to the adoption of measures aimed at improving energy efficiency in existing homes and public buildings."
"The Commission announced that it is going to propose an amendment to the Structural Fund Regulations intended to support these measures, in order to extend the opportunities available in this area."
"I feel that it is vitally important for this amendment to be aimed at using the resources supplied by the European Regional Development Fund to improve housing and at increasing the rate of 2% currently provided."
"Future global architecture of financial markets and EU economic recovery plan (debate)"
"We welcome students from the European University of Rome who are present in the gallery."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council and Commission on the future global architecture of financial markets and EU economic recovery plan - B6-0487/2008) and - B6-0488/2008)."
"Mr President, Mr Alumnia, Mr Novelli, Mr Barroso, a short while ago, we were told that the time had come for the Commission to nudge Member States."
"If such is the Commission's strategy, you are welcome here in Parliament, and you will have our full support in the implementation of such a strategy."
"For us, the current problem resides in the degree of cooperation between Member States."
"Too often, what we see is a realisation of the urgency of the situation and a juxtaposition of national solutions that are then dressed up as a European solution."
"We think that we must proceed differently if we wish to make better use of our resources."
"With regard to the international financial architecture, the G20 met and defined future deadlines."
"When I look at the conclusions of the Ecofin Council, as adopted yesterday, one thing strikes me, which is that I do not see any mandate for the Commission in its conclusions."
"I therefore would like the Council to tell me how it intends to implement its proposals, in particular with regard to combating the non-cooperative nature of certain jurisdictions and defining the role of the IMF in relation to other international financial institutions."
"I would also like the Council and the Commission to tell us what are the next stages in the light of the timetable adopted, and under what conditions might Parliament become involved in these debates, since I believe that this is how we must proceed if we want a European dynamic."
"With regard to the recovery plan, a figure of 1.5% was flagged up."
"Compared to the figures circulating previously, this must be considered a step in the right direction."
"Will it be enough, is it really 1.5% or is this renaming of expenditure already planned?"
"We will have to examine this in more detail."
"But with regard to the plan itself, I would like to make three comments."
"Firstly, if there is no real coordination, within the meaning of the treaty, within the meaning of Article 99, which asks Member States to consider their economic policies as issues of common interest, we will fail."
"I am amazed to see that even from the conclusions of yesterday's Ecofin Council this method is still not being used."
"The coordination of economic policies in this critical phase cannot merely comprise submission by Member States of recovery plans initially discussed by their governments then subsequently assessed by the Commission."
"This is not enough."
"Secondly, I am amazed to see how no reference is made in this document to the prospect of a bounce-back, which I know is incompatible with the Treaty in its current state, but neither is reference made any longer to the idea circulating here and there, in my opinion quite rightly, of possible pooling of the borrowings of Member States in the euro zone."
"If the Commission wishes to be audacious, now is the time to initiate these lines of debate."
"Perhaps the Council will not immediately support such a proposal, but given your record in this Chamber, you will, I am almost certain, be able to obtain support here in Parliament, which makes it worthwhile your continuing along these lines."
"The third issue is that of jobs and wages."
"You just referred to the importance of the goal in terms of jobs."
"Do not forget that these must be high-quality jobs, or we will not reach the goals we defined in our Lisbon Strategy."
"Finally, may I make a final comment on the European Investment Bank."
"It is now charged with many tasks, but we must monitor the way in which the banks themselves implement these facilities and tools, which are now being proposed once again since SMEs are obliged to use the banking system in order to access them."
"Well we know how fragile the banking system is, and so I should like to ask you to look at this issue closely and I invite us collectively to learn the lessons of the past, in other words to define the public expenditure that is useful for our long-term objectives in a coordinated manner, otherwise that public expenditure will be pointless."
"We would like to welcome back our President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Novelli, who was one of our Members between 1999 and 2002, if I remember rightly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should first like to reply to Mrs Berès, firstly by providing a brief retrospective on what has happened over the last year or so."
"The crisis which started in the United States is, as you all know, continuing to have consequences."
"While the situation in the financial sector seems to have stabilised and shows signs of improvement, although everything has not yet settled down, the challenge is, from now on, to limit the effects of this financial crisis on the real economy and businesses as far as possible."
"The forecast published by the Commission at the beginning of November, shows a considerable drop in economic growth in the European Union, which is expected to be 1.4% in 2008, whereas only in 2007 it was 2.9%."
"In 2009, according to the Commission, business activity in the European Union is expected to stagnate with an annual average growth rate of 0.2% GDP."
"Growth is expected to return very slowly over the course of the year to reach an annual average of 1.1% in 2010."
"This will be the situation, to the extent that it can be predicted, over the coming weeks and months."
"Concerning the financial situation - if this seems to be moving in a better direction than a few months ago, this is mainly as a result of the determined action of Member States and central banks, including the European Central Bank, and as my colleague and friend Jean-Pierre Jouyet has spoken at length on this issue, I will not revisit the subject."
"The Heads of State of the euro zone countries met on 12 October and for the first time agreed on a concerted action plan, whose principles were approved by the European Council on 15 and 16 October."
"All Member States have now adopted national measures in conformity with the principles in this plan, for example, as you already know, through guarantee mechanisms for the financing of banks and systems enabling their recapitalisation."
"In addition, the ECB has deployed considerable efforts to provide liquidity to the market, by diversifying its invitations to tender and extending the range of its collaterals."
"I believe that we have demonstrated solidarity in supporting Member States gripped by financial difficulties."
"We have helped one Member State, Hungary, at the start of November, this had to be done."
"We have now also agreed on the need to raise the upper limit for loans that the Union may make under this arrangement from EUR 12 billion to EUR 25 billion."
"I believe, as you have already said, Mrs Berès, that now is the time to relaunch our economy."
"The Member States and the Union must act in concert and contribute to a wider response at the global level."
"With regard to the recovery of the European economy, the Commission has taken the initiative of publishing a communiqué on 26 November, a European economic recovery plan for growth and jobs."
"The Council is very pleased with this communiqué, and I am pleased that you regard this, Mrs Berès, as a step in the right direction."
"In order to completely resolve the crisis, and particularly to draw lessons from it, we must analyse what has happened."
"The original financial turbulence, as you know, appeared in the subprime market in the US."
"These gradually spread, revealing serious malfunctions in our financial systems."
"From the macroeconomic point of view, this crisis also reflects the implications of internal imbalances in terms of household debt, and of external imbalances particularly the current deficit in the US."
"But it is, I wish to stress, above all, a crisis in the regulation of financial markets which reveals the defective operation of certain aspects of our frameworks of regulation and monitoring."
"A large number of these aspects have already been discussed as part of the road maps and the work conducted by the Ecofin Council during the French Presidency."
"But in addition to the urgent measures taken at Community level to restore confidence in the financial markets and protect savers' deposits, support financial institutions and provide assistance to Member States in difficulties, the fundamental reforms you are asking for, Mrs Berès, are, I believe, already underway."
"On this subject, I should like to express my pleasure with the agreement reached in the Council on four draft directives, which will have a decisive effect on improving the stability of the financial sector, protecting individuals, and further strengthening the internal market."
"These are the directive on bank capital requirements, the directive on deposit guarantees, solvency II, and the directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS)."
"Furthermore, work is in progress on the monitoring of financial institutions that have hitherto not been monitored."
"Work on European regulations concerning rating agencies has begun and is expected to be completed in spring 2009."
"I have no doubt that Parliament shares our determination to ensure that these texts are adopted as soon as possible."
"Furthermore, the French Presidency of the Council has undertaken to initiate long-term work on the procyclicity of financial regulations with a view to reviewing the supervisory and accounting framework and on the incentives offered in the financial sector, by examining the very important issue of the remuneration of managers and market traders."
"With regard to supervision in Europe, concrete progress has already been reported over the last few months: greater convergence between the practices of national supervisory systems so that each implements the documents in an equivalent manner; strengthening the supervisory systems of cross-border groups by establishing supervisory boards; and more efficient operation of European supervisory committees, with the introduction of qualified majority voting for their meetings to improve decision-making procedures."
"However, I believe more radical changes are necessary in this area, and we are very much looking forward to the work of the high-level group chaired by Jacques de Larosière, which will also look at supervision, particularly the issue of the supervision of investment funds."
"In any event, all these achievements and this work point to the European Union remaining the driving force in the international work being conducted in response to the financial crisis."
"The Union has definitely been a driving force in international activity aimed at a thorough reform of the global financial architecture, in particular, an increase in the capacity of international financial institutions in order to prevent crisis factors from reappearing."
"The crisis has very clearly demonstrated that these problems, which are of global scale, must be resolved at the global level."
"The French Presidency has therefore taken the initiative of proposing to the United States that an international summit be held, which would include the main emerging countries, to define the principles and the initial actions to be taken for the re-establishment of international financial architecture."
"With this aim in mind, the Presidency submitted proposals to the Member States."
"These proposals were discussed at the Ecofin Council and then adopted by the Heads of State or Government."
"Europe was thus able, and I believe this is very important, to speak with one voice at the Washington meeting on 15 November."
"Prior to the G20 meeting, the Ecofin Council played its part by defining the European Union's common message with regard to international financial architecture."
"At its meeting on 4 November, it examined all relevant questions in order to decide on a European response to the crisis and its proposal was subsequently endorsed by the Heads of State or Government at their informal meeting on 7 November."
"I believe that this European unity has enabled very significant progress to be made, particularly on the part of our partners in the US and in emerging countries, both in terms of supporting global growth and in the regulation and supervision of global financial markets whose principle has been extended to all stakeholders, markets and jurisdictions."
"I am convinced that this summit represents the starting point for a review of the tools and resources of international financial institutions."
"The IMF must be supplied with a wide range of instruments that will enable it to support the Member States flexibly and rapidly."
"The World Bank must be rallied to provide the necessary finance for emerging and poor countries, enabling them to deal with the shortages and price increases in market resources."
"Furthermore, not only must the international financial institutions have the resources to deal with crises, they must also play a key role in their prevention."
"The IMF, in particular, in association with the Financial Stability Forum, must be able to identify any accumulation of risks and bubbles in the financial system and recommend the corresponding economic policies."
"The Council therefore unreservedly supports the statement issued by the Heads of State or Government of the G20 countries, made public on 15 November."
"Everything is now in place for developing common European positions so that this 'Washington declaration' can be implemented within the timescale set out for the next international deadlines."
"Fundamentally, and to conclude, Mr President, I believe that in addition to the progress made on the basic issues, two important messages may be drawn from this."
"Europe, after very rapid preparation, spoke with one voice at the Washington summit."
"Europe must therefore remain a driving force in the current debate on reforming international financial architecture."
"Our internal discussions and the reforms which we will go on adopting must continue in order to feed in to this process, which is only just beginning."
"Mr President, Mr Novelli, Mr Jouyet, Mrs Berès, ladies and gentlemen, less than a month ago in Strasbourg we spoke about the results and conclusions of the Washington meeting."
"Today Mrs Berès is asking the Council and the Commission what steps need to be taken to put the conclusions into practice, who should take them and what action each European institution should take to that end."
"I must say to her that I absolutely agree that these decisions, like those adopted since September 2007 in the Ecofin Council and the European Council, have to be made swiftly while respecting the roles of all the Community institutions."
"All the Community institutions must be involved in building a consensus, so that Europe can hold a single position on all the issues needed to regulate the financial system more effectively and to find solutions to its problems."
"The EU will thus continue to be able to lead the world in providing solutions at future meetings following on from the Washington meeting."
"The Commission is of course working in this respect."
"We are playing our part within the de Larosière Group on one hand, and we are developing our own initiatives on the other."
"The Commission updated these announcements in the Ecofin Council only yesterday."
"In addition, the Commission is certainly going to use its own powers, in conjunction with the Council and Parliament, to reach the required agreements as soon as possible."
"It is very important to coordinate the EU's actions and positions in the financial field, because we are going to take part in a global coordination process, and Europe cannot go into global coordination holding several different positions."
"We have to go in with a single position that has been formally adopted within the European Union."
"With regard to the economic recovery and reflationary plan discussed by the Ecofin Council yesterday, the Ministers agreed with the Commission's view that, given the economic situation and the recession affecting the United States, Japan, the euro area and some major EU economies outside the euro area, a fiscal stimulus is essential."
"Monetary policy must continue to sustain demand, but it cannot bear the whole burden alone, especially in view of the current situation of the financial and credit markets."
"Fiscal and budgetary policy has to provide a stimulus as well."
"The Commission proposed a stimulus that it considers both necessary and possible in a situation such as the one we are in."
"We specified the extent to which we will contribute with European resources and measures, both through the EU budget and through the actions of the European Investment Bank and the EBRD."
"I admit that a number of Ecofin members unfortunately did not welcome our proposal to both the Council and Parliament to make it possible to use unspent funds more flexibly without altering the overall ceiling of the EU's budget, thus enabling us to devote the sum of EUR 5 billion to investment in infrastructure and fighting climate change at a European level."
"Unfortunately the proposal did not gain enough unanimous support."
"Nonetheless, we hope it will go ahead."
"In addition to the European endeavour (through the EU's budget plus the European Investment Bank, and here the Ministers did actually agree to increase the capital, as the Commission had proposed, by the end of 2009), we also asked the Member States to make an effort amounting to EUR 170 billion in 2009 by adopting what they considered to be the most appropriate demand-boosting measures in their current circumstances."
"This proposal takes the Member States' own responsibility into consideration, since they hold the budget for funding recovery through fiscal policy."
"It also takes account of the fact that not all Member States have the same room for manoeuvre."
"We cannot ask Hungary or Latvia to contribute as much right now as Germany or the Netherlands."
"That is not the Commission's position, of course."
"All the Member States should benefit from the boost and the resulting recovery, whilst not all of them can contribute to the same extent because their starting situations are different."
"Coordination is therefore essential."
"By coordinating actions, we can make one plus one equal three."
"Without coordination, one plus one might give a negative result."
"This is a clear example of the urgent need for coordination."
"Some countries have no room for manoeuvre, while others have to decide whether to use the room that they have."
"If we do not maximise every country's energies and opportunities, we shall all lose out in the end."
"That is the message that the Commission put across to the Ecofin Ministers yesterday."
"I have three very specific points to make."
"First, in the previous debate, a Member of this Parliament said that the Stability and Growth Pact was no longer in force."
"As I have said to this Parliament on many occasions and I repeat again, the Stability and Growth Pact is in full force, and it is in full force because in 2005 we revised it and introduced the flexibility it needed to be of use in a situation such as this."
"The Pact is in force because we revised it in 2005, and there is no need to reinvent it or to change it."
"What we do need to do is implement it and respect it, but we must respect it within the limits and with the flexibility that budgetary policy requires at times like these."
"Secondly, Mrs Berès referred to European debt securities."
"There are some major countries that clearly rule out this possibility and refuse to consider it."
"Should there be a joint issue of national public debt securities?"
"There are some major euro area countries that reject this possibility."
"There is a third possibility, however, which has been given unanimous support and which we intend to use."
"It involves the European Investment Bank providing additional and more specific funding for those investments and measures considered essential for sustaining demand and maximising the impact of this Europe-wide endeavour at such a time as this."
"Lastly, I fully agree with Mrs Berès's call for quality jobs."
"When the Commission included in the recovery plan not only a fiscal endeavour but also ten priority actions for smart investments, what we were looking for was more growth, more sustainability and better quality employment than can be provided by some short-term measures."
"Such measures might admittedly be temporary, which is one of the requirements of the boost."
"They do not, however, have the other two properties needed for this to be a quality fiscal endeavour, namely that they must be able to boost and increase demand in the short term, and they must also expand the possibilities for our economies during the economic recovery which will certainly follow."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Ministers, Commissioner, firstly, with regard to the questions, I would say that they clearly demonstrate Parliament's desire to be kept informed and to be more involved in the process of reforming the architecture of the financial markets."
"Parliament is also determined that Europe should speak with one voice, as has been said."
"With regard to Europe's economic recovery, concerted and coordinated action is, of course, essential, as has been pointed out."
"For our part, we support the Commission's proposal to combine all available European and national political levers in order to combat this crisis."
"Indeed, the task is now to restore confidence among Europeans and, hence, consumers."
"We also need to strike the right balance between the long term and the short term."
"The measures taken in particular with regard to the banking sector are good for combating this financial crisis: an increase of capital, interbank loan guarantees and guarantees for loans."
"We do, however, need to be vigilant when it comes to actually realising the objective of these measures, that of reinstating the banks to their primary role as suppliers of liquidity and credit - in short, the objective of financing the real economy."
"The role of the EIB and the EBRD must be strengthened."
"The EIB's reserves must be used to strengthen its capital base."
"The budget structuring is also a step in the right direction."
"However, words aside, what counts is implementing the planned measures."
"We must avoid blowing hot and cold."
"I would mention here State aid with regard to the bank-related programmes."
"I would also mention here - and you spoke about it just now - the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We have to realise that our fellow citizens who, in this time of crisis, expect Europe to provide solutions, should not feel that Europe says one thing one day and then the next day does the opposite."
"Lastly, Minister, on the subject of the regulation on ratings agencies, for which I am rapporteur in this House, we will work diligently to implement an effective and pragmatic system that does not react merely to the current situation but that makes it possible for these agencies to operate on a long-term basis."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to confirm to Commissioner Almunia that 'one plus one' is not two but three if we do it together."
"I will try to explain this to my little grandson and he will understand, as he is becoming a good European."
"I am not going to go into coordination because I think my good colleague Mrs Berès has underlined the issue, as you did yourself."
"I would just like to say one thing on that - this is also directed to the Presidency of the European Union and the Council - which is that there is a great danger that our Member States have not yet really understood the magnitude of the need for financial investments."
"Let me just give an illustration: if our aim is to maintain the present employment level in the European Union, we need to invest 1% more of GDP not only in 2009 but also an extra percentage in 2010 and an extra percentage in 2011."
"This is documented by our macroeconomic calculations covering the whole of the European Union."
"My hope is that what we do before Christmas will be a beginning - and I know that the French Presidency shares this ambition."
"Therefore, please make a timeline which says: let us evaluate the effects before spring next year and before the spring Council."
"Let us be ready before the spring Council to create new financial stimuli."
"Because I fear that the Commission's present prognosis - and it has done it as well as it can - will be supplemented by a new one which will show us that the job to be done is even more demanding."
"Finally, I want to talk about regulation."
"I should like to thank the Presidency very much for saying this is a regulatory crisis."
"I agree."
"That is why I am so disappointed by the information I got yesterday in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs under the leadership of Mrs Berès."
"We have unanimously here in Parliament agreed on a report saying that due to this regulatory crisis we must have new regulations empowering all financial actors without exception - including hedge funds and private equity."
"Yesterday I got a message from Commissioner McCreevy saying: 'I hereby invite all actors to a new consultation on hedge funds'."
"Two years ago we had the last consultations on hedge funds, which only concentrated on those guys in the City of London."
"We now have a new consultation two years later."
"We do not need more consultations."
"We need regulations."
"We know exactly what the problem is."
"Then Mr McCreevy said yesterday: 'By the way, I do not intend to do anything about private equity'."
"However, he is asking the lobby organisations for private equity whether they would be so kind as to ask those who are not covered by the Code of Conduct to be covered."
"(Interruption from another Member)"
"(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, it is my turn now!"
"What I am trying to say is: please I need your help - and I am calling on you Commissioner Almunia - I want you to understand that people will simply not understand that we, the European Union, are not capable of fulfilling our duty to regulate the financial market in a comprehensive way, so that we can be sure that this situation will not occur again; and that we can finance this expansion exactly as Commissioner Almunia described."
"I would really ask you for an answer before Christmas so I can tell my little grandson 'let us go for it!'"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Unless we achieve a truly common stance in the EU in favour of real reform, achieving adequate global rules for the financial markets becomes much harder."
"Sensible people would say that a massive failure of both regulation and oversight, together with revealed flaws of an overly simplistic economic paradigm, provide an indubitable answer to what to do."
"But some still argue that soft regulations should be the norm of the new system."
"In my view, they are wrong, whether they honestly think so or are driven by parochial interests."
"One of Keynes' intellectual legacies - that highly volatile capital flows are inimical to trade and prosperity - has shown its relevance in the current huge mess and other crises, including in emerging markets."
"For decades now a mantra has been heard worldwide: that not much can be done in national policy-making because global markets would punish a government."
"But is the complexion of global financial markets God-given?"
"Are not global markets, aside from their technological drivers, also the product of human beings' decisions to set rules for finance, trade and investment?"
"The claim that nothing can be done about finance, when it brings about misery, is unconvincing."
"Much can be done in regulating all financial entities (including hedge funds and private equity funds), constraining leverage, dealing with pro-cyclicality and accounting, coordinating policies better, dealing with the rating agencies."
"The decline of a paradigm which equates market economies with no regulations has to be seen in conjunction with a rising multi-polar economic world in the attempt to forge a new international financial system."
"On the latter hinges the fate of an open world economic system."
"Unless we do the right things now, we run the risk of crippling our liberal democracies."
"I hope that the new American administration will be forthcoming in this respect. But we at home in Europe have to rise to the momentousness of this period."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should first like to wholeheartedly endorse Mr Rasmussen's assessment that we are talking about a completely new relationship between state and market, with regard to the entire financial world."
"I think that on that point we agree."
"Also with regard to the role of Mr McCreevy, I would say that he should play a smaller role than previously and he should not be allowed to delay now under any circumstances."
"What we can learn from the collapse of the financial markets is what happens if the state holds back too much and does not dare to apply the rules which it has identified as correct."
"I should like to link the current dispute about a new green deal with the European recovery plan once again."
"In my opinion, there are still too many waiverers in the European Council and in the European Commission who assume that sustainability strategies or aggressive climate protection would be at the expense of jobs."
"And these same forces which are holding things up there, are in our opinion - we Greens are also concerned about jobs - holding up the development of future-proof methods of production and future-proof economic systems and future-proof new products, and they are blocking our way out of Europe to the global markets of the future."
"I consider this highly dangerous and I think that the weak car regulation which we are currently making is a bad sign of how fearful we are."
"The recovery plan is now a bit Keynes, a bit green, but really underneath it is still the same old thing."
"I do not believe it is enough for Europe to make only slight changes."
"Perhaps coordination can win more approval if the strategies are formulated more consistently."
"Reviewing the entire EU budget at the beginning of next year would give the Commission an opportunity to approach the various major crises which we have to manage in a systematic and uniform manner."
"(SK) Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament and guests, I applaud the initiative of European Union institutions which gave an impulse for dealing with the financial crisis at the global level."
"However the economic response to the consequences of the financial crisis based on a plan for restoring growth and employment in the European Union seems to me to be more like a hasty improvisation."
"The plan idealises the situation and forgets that the European Union is a group of national states, each of which is in different circumstances and has different priorities and different solutions to economic problems and economic development."
"The plan underestimates the importance of the coordinated development of energy infrastructure as a whole, not only green energy, and the coordinated development of road and rail infrastructure as a prerequisite for the effective distribution of investment, as well as the need to deal with the financing of the agricultural sector."
"This is because, along with the financial crisis, the world is also facing the threat of an energy and food crisis."
"(ES) Mr President, I am not going to say much about the exceptional, historic nature of the current crisis."
"All my fellow Members have mentioned this, and Mr Rasmussen has expressed it very well."
"I just want to add three things here: this is the worst liquidity crisis that I have ever known, and I am getting on in years; there are no navigation charts or roadmaps for this crisis; and, thirdly, we are well aware that the financial crisis is ongoing and the markets have run dry."
"The first thing we have to do, therefore, is to normalise the financial markets, and in this respect I am going to talk about the European Central Bank."
"In this House there is a kind of reverential respect for the European Central Bank."
"I am a layman in many areas, including this one, but I must say that the ECB has to bring down interest rates quickly and as a matter of urgency."
"The transfer mechanisms do not work well, as shown in October, when the official interest rate cut was not passed on enough into real interest rates."
"Secondly, liquidity has to be provided over a longer term than is currently the case."
"I am aware that for this to happen the framework of guarantees has to be changed, but it has to be done."
"Financial institutions lend money over the long term and they need reliable financing over the long term as well."
"The national banks are helping with the Central Bank's policy to supply liquidity, and this may result in national aids that distort competition."
"We therefore have to keep a careful watch on this area."
"My third and last point is that right now budgetary policy has been shown to be playing the central, leading role far more than monetary policy is."
"Budgetary policy causes external effects, and that means that close coordination is vital."
"I agree wholeheartedly with what the Commissioner has said."
"To continue, I also agree that it is important to spend, but most of all it is important to spend wisely on clear objectives that enhance the competitiveness of Europe's economy."
"That is the only way in which we will be able to balance our budget again in the medium term."
"I agree that the Stability and Growth Pact is still in force, and the first thing that the Commissioner should do is tell us what he understands by 'departing from the reference value'."
"Does this mean by a few hundredths, a few tenths or a few points?"
"Believe me, Commissioner;"
"I shall keep a careful watch on the work you have to do for the Stability and Growth Pact to remain in force. If you achieve this, may God reward you, and if not, may He hold you to account."
"(PT) We have heard it said several times here today that a crisis normally creates an opportunity, and that is true."
"If we wish to take advantage of the opportunity which presents itself, the course of action is easy to decide on."
"Firstly, at the level of the European Union we are aware of the need to introduce mechanisms for transparency in and regulation and supervision of the financial markets."
"There is no need for Commissioner McCreevy to start more consultations or for the Presidency to analyse and elicit more studies and proposals: we need look no further than the proposals of the socialists, which were made at the appropriate time and many of which have been taken up by this Parliament."
"Secondly, internationally: Europe cannot take part in the international arena in a passive way."
"It must play an active part in building the new international order, and it must be the defender of a new architecture that does not leave black holes in the system, such as those currently presented by tax havens."
"Thirdly, we have heard the President of the Commission say here today that there is reluctance amongst the various States to coordinate strategies."
"It is true that, if we had not heard so many times from members of the Commission that markets self-regulate, that the State should remain uninvolved and that financial markets have no impact on growth or employment, perhaps there would be a greater and more active spirit of solidarity amongst the various countries."
"However, the proposal which we have before us today is one that is only the first part of a long process if we compare it with the programmes of China and the United States; it also fails to define its goal sufficiently clearly, and this goal must be employment; finally, a European programme cannot be an amalgamation of national agendas."
"Now is the time for us to show the citizens of Europe that Europe is a network of rights that also encompasses the economic sphere; that it protects them in times of crisis, and that it promotes solidarity with and growth and support programmes for the small and medium-sized enterprises that are currently not in receipt of the results of the interventions that were made in the banking sector."
"The real economy is exactly that, and we are here, as Europeans, to show the citizens that Europe is here too and, above all, on their side."
"(NL) Mr President, it strikes me as rather odd that, in recent years, there have never been sufficient funds for education, care, innovation and the environment and that it should now suddenly rain billions."
"The best rescue plan for the future is a strong European market combined with healthy government funds, for we should not squander the inheritance of future generations."
"The private debt crisis should not simply be traded for public debt."
"The Commission should make a firm stand for strict compliance with the Stability Pact and rules on State aid, and, in this light, I welcome the statements made by Mr Almunia and Mrs Kroes."
"After all, it is not just bankers, but also politicians, who should spend citizens' money wisely."
"It is not so much the money presses, but the Lisbon Strategy, that should be shifted into top gear, because there is a great deal of benefit to be had from it."
"For example, a free services market can create hundreds of thousands of new jobs, for no extra cost."
"It is therefore surprising, to my mind, that the Member States should be so slow in introducing the Services Directive."
"A rescue plan for the growing number of school leavers with no qualifications is at least just as hard as for the duped savers, because without a qualification, these young people have absolutely no standing in life."
"Alternatively, we should invest in achieving the 3% objective for research and development that was set back in 2000."
"After all, whilst industry never delivered its promised 2% share, it is receiving billions of support at the moment."
"Finally, given that things can go badly wrong in the free market, rules and market supervisors are certainly no luxury, but, even so, there is no comparison with the economic and social ruins that have been left behind in various experiments with nationalism and socialist state economy."
"(DE) Mr President, I am not alone in finding it difficult to join in with this emerging self-importance of the European decision-makers when it comes to management of the financial market crisis, for if Europe, if the EU were a functioning democracy, one would first have to raise the question of responsibility and how it could all have happened."
"It is simply not true that all the problems we are now facing involve a tsunami, something caused by Nature."
"This is man-made."
"With all this regulatory fervour that characterises this Union, one asks oneself why action was not taken when banks began to cross national borders to an appreciable extent?"
"Why, in spite of corresponding warnings, was action not taken when derivatives crept in."
"I clearly remember that Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz addressed all these points."
"There was a silence, a taboo."
"That is where you would have to start because recognising one's own faults is the only key to finding the solution in future."
"(EL) The European Parliament has to give a clear message about both sides of this discussion today: firstly, concerning the rationale of the financial system that we have to build for the future and secondly, concerning our initial reaction to the recovery plan which was put forward by the Commission on 26 November."
"On the first of those, there is no doubt that the Commission has clearly got the message that the era of self-regulation or non-regulation is well and truly over."
"If there are some within the Commission or even within this Parliament who were under the impression that the real economy could be built on the rationale of no rules, then current events would have proved them wrong."
"It took us some time but now we understand."
"I do not think that Commissioner Almunia is to blame."
"Others may have exposed the Commission to this rationale but now it is too late."
"Now the new economic order must be built on a rationale that is governed by rules, rules and more rules."
"The second part of the recovery plan, which was put forward by the Commission last week, does contain some positive points, and we must recognise that the Commission has managed (and I know how hard that is) to reconcile differences of opinion and offer governments an interconnected framework for actions with a common rationale."
"Now I can hear people on the left and right saying such things as, 'we wanted it differently,' 'it might be too expensive,' or 'we do not like it'."
"These are the same people that, if the Commission had done nothing, would have said 'the Commission is not doing anything,' 'we are waiting for the Commission to give us a blueprint'."
"Therefore I believe that the second message we must send to the Commissioner is that the rationale behind this package is the right one, it is going to help governments and it may well be a life raft on which the real economy can survive during the first days of a crisis."
"- (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, by preparing a rescue and recovery plan for the European economy, the European Union is giving an initial message to its citizens, in addition to the markets."
"There is great anticipation and we cannot disappoint expectations."
"At a time when financial consolidation and the level of public debt are liable to be adversely affected by public intervention, both in terms of the resources actually given and those guaranteed, in an effort to rescue the major financial and industrial players, with the obvious repercussions for public finances and personal income, we need a coordinated approach at European level, also to combat tax evasion and tax havens."
"It is important that all the appropriations and national plans are strictly and efficiently coordinated and targeted at the same objective."
"I am pleased to point out that there are plans to clarify the flexible application of the Stability Pact, which must be targeted, temporary and appropriate, featuring mechanisms aimed at structural changes, the efficient allocation of public funds, restructuring of public expenditure and investments for growth in line with the Lisbon Strategy's objectives, focusing particular attention on the role of small and medium-sized businesses."
"The joint approach must also cover macroeconomic budget policies, as well as salary policies and a gradual, sharp reduction in the tax burden on labour and pensions."
"This must be implemented using tax deductions, revised tax rates and compensation for fiscal drag in order to reduce poverty, and not just extreme poverty, and to promote consumption and economic growth by providing a counter-cyclical response to the current economic crisis which presages a recession."
"But on a note of caution, the task of maintaining incomes and relaunching consumer demand must be carried out, with the focus actually on environmental and social sustainability, thereby avoiding the need to blindly reproduce models and systems which have demonstrated all their weaknesses."
"Mr President, what I miss in this recovery plan is a reference to financial markets."
"At the beginning of this year, when there were discussions on broad economic guidelines, Parliament came up with a proposal to include a financial market dimension in the guidelines."
"Unfortunately, at that time the Commission was against this proposal."
"However, the development of events showed that we were right."
"I would urge you not to repeat this mistake once again and to link the economic recovery plan with the upgraded Financial Services Action Plan."
"If we undertake this strategy it will be possible in the long run to reflect the needs of the real economy in an ongoing modernisation of EU financial architecture."
"- (LT) I would also like to encourage the scrutiny of your proposals from the perspective of financial market participants."
"The Commission is now providing so many new proposals that it is difficult even for us, Members of Parliament, to handle."
"They are not very well coordinated."
"Just think how the heads of financial market institutions and investors, who indeed have difficulties in deciding, must feel."
"It is far from giving the impression that our market is stable; therefore, I believe that more coordination is required."
"Mr President, we have heard quite a lot about coordination, but I am beginning to wonder whether coordination is any longer sufficient, whether we need to move to solidarity rather than just coordination because the crisis has moved from just being banks, which is bad enough, to being a crisis of countries."
"Just as the coordination has justifiably moved up from national to European to global levels, perhaps we now need to consider whether more solidarity is necessary."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council whether they are indeed addressing the issue of the global institutions, as the oral question specifically requests about the International Monetary Fund, or alternative institutions that might perform the solidarity role on a global basis."
"My second question would be to do with the type of stimulus we should be looking for in fiscal stimulus, if that is indeed the preferred route."
"Should value added tax be the route and should it allow for reduced rates of value added tax from the high or middle rate down to the lower rate in certain areas - and what are we doing about that?"
"And is it not much better to have it concentrated in that way rather than spread widely on a much lower reduction level?"
"Regulation: we hear a lot, especially from our leftward-leaning friends, that we must have more and more regulation, destroy the hedge funds and private equity, credit rating agencies and so forth."
"We must wait, we must think hard and carefully and we must at all costs avoid unintended consequences."
"If new regulation is justified - and it may be - it must be the right regulation and it must not turn out to be an impediment to recovery and prevent or delay that recovery."
"In some ways I would really like to give Mr McCreevy support for his measured reaction to the problems and not condemn him, as many of our colleagues seem to wish to do."
"Lastly, public finances."
"The stability and growth pact affects both euro countries and non-euro countries."
"If temporary excess deficits are justified - and that is a big if - they must be temporary, they must be recuperable to a realistic schedule and, if some countries can afford the debt but others cannot, then surely we return to this question of mutual solidarity."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to tell me what they consider realistic schedules for dealing with this issue."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my question relates to what you think about Iceland and Hungary introducing the euro as a second currency."
"Do you think that that could solve the problem of these two countries?"
"The second question is: do you think that it would be possible to introduce a risk premium for derivatives which would then be used to strengthen the banks' own capital?"
"My third question is: do you not think that a reduction in value added tax would encourage imports, in particular from China and India?"
"Would it not make more sense to consider tax reductions for our businesses and for our employees, to pay investment premiums, to focus on progressive depreciation and above all to increase assets of a minor value by a factor of ten to avoid taxing fictitious profits and to keep the money in the enterprise, thus also enabling wages to be paid more easily?"
"(RO) The EU economic recovery plan provides for sound investments, which is why it supports the increase in budget allocations by around EUR 200 billion for the period ahead, as part of the economic growth and stability pact."
"I appreciate in particular the readiness of the European Central Bank to cut interest rates in order to ensure the levels of liquidity required by the banking system to be able to invest in the real economy."
"I also particularly appreciate the proposal made to amend the financial framework in order to invest during the next two years EUR 5 billion in developing the broadband infrastructure and connecting up Europe's power infrastructures."
"I welcome the initiative launched by the European Investment Bank and certain national banks aimed at creating a 2020 fund earmarked for energy and climate change activities and for developing the transport infrastructure."
"It will be possible to use state aid to support research and development, innovation, communication and information technology, transport and energy efficiency."
"(SK) I think that the two-year economic recovery plan can become a good, coordinated response of the European Union to the economic crisis, provided that it is carried out and implemented in a reasonable manner."
"The proposed volume of funding to support the Union's economy should create a financial framework that is sufficient to stimulate the Member States' economies towards new development impulses."
"The EUR 30 billion, which is to be provided in equal shares from the European Union's budget and the European Investment Bank, must be well-targeted at the development of the knowledge-based economy and low-carbon economy, as well as at medium and long-term energy efficiency programmes."
"As regards tax incentives, I think that these measures should remain in the hands of the Member States."
"Personally, I am an advocate of the idea of reducing VAT rates for certain products closely related to energy efficiency that can stimulate high energy savings."
"To conclude, I have to admit I have certain concerns in connection with the plan to apply maximum flexibility, which is made possible by the revised Stability and Growth Pact."
"Certain governments have a tendency to abuse such measures for their populist and purely political objectives, without a clear development concept."
"Mr President, I would like to pay a special tribute to the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has become the new Margaret Thatcher of Europe."
"She, like the Iron Lady, believes in balanced budgets and not spending your way out of the credit crunch and economic crisis in an unfunded way."
"Instead and in contrast, the British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, has got a massive borrow-and-spend fiscal reflationary crisis economic package, with no way of having a balanced budget."
"Whilst I accept that it was our own British banks whose reckless lending landed us in the mess in the first place, with poor regulation and supervision by the government, I believe this fiscal policy - which is highly irresponsible - must also be accompanied by cuts in public spending and well thought out plans to fund it in the longer run."
"Otherwise we will invite, after a period of economic shrinkage, a period of massive inflation which will erode all our savings and undermine European economies."
"Mr President, I welcome the work which the Member States, the Council and the Commission are doing in dealing with this difficult issue."
"Many of my colleagues have already dealt in detail with the action that is required."
"However, at this time Member States should not change their commitment to developing countries."
"There is a need for EU Member States to maintain overseas development assistance (ODA)."
"The financial crisis is expected to have a severe impact on humanitarian funding, with some analysts predicting cuts in ODA of up to a third or more."
"EU Member States should not slack off on meeting the Millennium Development Goal targets now that there is a temptation to reduce spending."
"The worldwide financial meltdown has highlighted the interdependent globalised nature of our world."
"Even if developing nations have avoided many of the immediate effects of the financial crisis, owing to their limited exposure to global markets, economists are warning that there will be a knock-on effect in terms of a reduction in aid inflows as well as remittance, foreign direct investment and economic growth."
"We could see developing countries suffer considerably for a financial mess they did not create."
"Therefore Member States should maintain the status quo."
"I apologise to Mr Gollnisch and Mr Sikierski, who asked to speak, but unfortunately, we are running very late and we are therefore stopping at five speeches."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to tell Mr Almunia that he rightly emphasised three aspects that are very important for ensuring the effectiveness of the recovery."
"The first is strong enough action."
"From this perspective, one and a half per cent of GDP is a recovery objective that would appear to me to be quite substantial, given the sums at stake."
"The second is taking account of the different situations among Member States."
"He rightly emphasised that the countries were not all, dare I say it, in the same boat regarding the economic or budgetary situation, but that this does not exempt them for making a really coordinated effort."
"This is something that the Presidency intends to work on before the next European Council meeting."
"I am convinced that it is in this way that, eventually - although I do not yet know how long this will be - we will be able to revive growth and employment."
"Mr Gauzès, I should like to say to you that you made the point well that all our efforts are focused on financing the real economy."
"If we are helping the banks, it is so that they can invest in this economy, and our only aim - and you were right to stress the point - is to finance small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I believe that, yesterday, the Council put a message across to the Commission concerning aid for the banks, and it is clear that we want flexible and quick decision-making regarding the support that can be given to the banks and the financial institutions in the current circumstances."
"I believe that the Council has been heard, and I should like to say to you, Mr Gauzès, that the Council very much shares your desire for rating agencies at European and, I would add, international, level to be effectively regulated, as many of my colleagues and many MEPs have said."
"Mr Rasmussen, I should like to say to you, even though your speech was addressed more to the Commission, that I agreed with you when you stressed that no market segment should be exempt from regulation or supervision."
"If there is indeed one message that we have taken away with us, it is that there is a lack of regulation of certain market segments."
"This regulation must therefore be improved and at times must be created in situations in which it is vital."
"This was a powerful message from the Washington Summit on 15 November, and Europe must, of course, work towards these objectives, including in the area of speculative funds."
"Mr Dăianu, it is true that the regulation of financial markets should be coordinated at international level; that is why, on the initiative of the European Union, the Washington Summit was held."
"I believe that it was this voice of Europe, a united Europe, that was the deciding factor in that Summit, enabling that Summit to outline a kind of road map for genuine regulation of the international financial system, and this, because Europe was able to work effectively on its own programme."
"Mrs Harms, to be precise, the recovery plan does propose long-term investment, perhaps not enough for your liking, but that is what it proposes, nonetheless."
"Mr Kozlík, I wish to say to you that, yes, we must support agricultural policy, as well as the other major European policies."
"You mentioned energy policy; I believe you were right to do so."
"These are priorities, and they should remain as such, including in this difficult period."
"Mr García-Margallo, the work of the European Central Bank has, in my view, played a decisive part in overcoming the difficulties that we have encountered only recently, and its president has clearly indicated that inflation is being curbed in Europe and that he is therefore anticipating, as a number of MEPs have noted, new room for manoeuvre in the area of monetary policy."
"I felt that Mrs Ferreira was rather harsh regarding the European Union's response."
"I believe that, unlike what she said, the European Union responded swiftly to the crisis by taking strong decisions in a very short time thanks to the positive cooperation of our institutions - the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament - and for that I thank you."
"With regard to support for SMEs, we will shortly hold a debate on the decisions taken at the Competitiveness Council regarding the adoption of a European Small Business Act, and I believe that, in this area too, Europe has played its part concerning the financing of SMEs and the priority they should be given, including in a period of economic slowdown."
"Mrs in't Veld, you were right to point out that the short-term recovery should be based on long-term structural reforms within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This strategy has never been so crucial, precisely in this period of economic slowdown, and the structural reforms have to be able to take their course."
"Mr Martin, I heard you clearly when you called for joint action to identify the true priorities."
"Mr Schinas, we had rules, but those rules did not work; that is the truth of the matter."
"We therefore need rules, but rules that are effective; not overregulation, of course, but a genuine framework that is suited to European competitiveness."
"Mrs Gottardi, I wish to say to you that I fully share your desire to combat tax fraud."
"The French Presidency has, moreover, made this a priority at European and international level."
"I also wish to say to you that I agree with your very pertinent comments on the need for effective economic recovery."
"Mrs Starkevičiūté, I agree that the normal slowdown of the financial sector is an integral part of the recovery of the European economy, and that this should be within a coordinated context."
"Mr Purvis, I agree, we do need to move in the direction of greater solidarity - that is important."
"This is, moreover, what we are proposing by basing the reform of the international financial system on the institutions created at Bretton Woods, including, in particular, the International Monetary Fund, a universal and politically legitimate institution that I am convinced will see its role strengthened in the years to come."
"You mentioned the issue of VAT."
"The Presidency is actually in favour of a VAT reduction targeted in particular at highly labour-intensive and non-relocatable sectors."
"Mr Rübig, you spoke on the same subject."
"VAT is an instrument that can - certainly if it is reduced - sustain activity and, in particular, employment, but these VAT reductions can only be targeted ones, and by that I mean it must be possible to prove that they are entirely appropriate."
"However, the debate on this matter is still not cut-and-dried, as you know."
"Mrs Ţicǎu, I believe that one of the principles of the Commission's proposals on the economic recovery is investment that is real and timely but also lasting and structural;"
"I am in complete agreement with you on this matter."
"Mr Hudacký, yes, the European Investment Bank is a very important tool for aiding economic recovery, including by means of various investments."
"I believe that this is a fundamental point."
"We will have the opportunity to place it on record during the Councils' debates next week."
"Mr Tannock, I do all the same believe, as the whole of the Council does, that we need a recovery that is concerted but can be reversed when there is a return to growth conditions."
"To conclude, I wish to say to you, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that this debate and all your questions have been very important and very interesting for the Council."
"They show that there is broad agreement between us regarding the need to have a strong and consistent European voice heard within international forums."
"The support of the European Parliament is essential."
"In this regard, I wish to thank you."
"We must, and I am convinced of this, completely rethink our approach to the financial system and its regulation."
"This must be done at European level but also by taking account of the solutions that will be found at international level, because, if there is indeed one lesson to be learnt from this crisis, it is that today's financial system has a truly international dimension; it is therefore at international level, spurred on by Europe, that solutions must be found."
"Mr President, Mr Novelli, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I am very grateful for your comments and observations and for the interest you have shown in the Commission's initiatives, particularly the recovery plan that we have been discussing this afternoon."
"I am not going to repeat many of the replies that Mr Novelli has just given."
"I agree with practically all his comments on what the Members who have spoken have said."
"I would just like to mention six points very quickly."
"First, I agree with the views of those of you, beginning with Mr Gauzès, who said that the credit crunch is extremely severe and lies at the root of the very great problems that the real economy is currently facing."
"Only yesterday at the Ecofin Council we were discussing how to improve the effectiveness of the recapitalisation and deposit guarantee plans that have been and are to be adopted by the various Member States."
"There is a lot of taxpayers' money at stake: considerable funds have gone into guaranteeing the operations of banks and financial institutions or providing them with capital."
"It is now a matter of getting credit to flow back into the economy, since it is a vital ingredient for the economy to work properly."
"Since it is not working well, the economic forecasts that Mr Rasmussen mentioned, which I presented a month ago, are unfortunately no longer the forecasts that I would present today."
"That is why I also announced to the ministers yesterday that I would be presenting new economic forecasts on 19 January."
"In the meantime, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, and other institutions have published estimates for 2009 that are even more worrying than those reflected in the Commission's forecasts of 3 November."
"The European Central Bank's are due tomorrow and are also dismal,"
"My second comment is that there is certainly going to be more regulation of financial services."
"In fact there is more regulation already."
"Only yesterday, at the Commission's initiative, the Council, as Mr Jouyet said earlier, gave its political approval to at least four - if I remember correctly - Commission initiatives on regulation of different aspects of the financial markets or services."
"Existing regulations need to be changed, unregulated areas need to be regulated, and improvements are needed in the quality of regulation and the way in which the implementation of these rules is supervised at European and global levels."
"We are talking about all of that."
"As the decision on the Solvency II draft directive is about to come before Parliament, let me tell you that the reaction in the Council still does not always accord with the Council's own statements on what needs to be done in terms of financial regulation and supervision."
"Parliament is aware of that, because it has been holding talks with the Council on this directive."
"There is no agreement on how best to coordinate supervisory actions in the insurance sector."
"We urgently need to find agreement on such supervision at a European scale, and we are already talking about a body of supervisors for institutions that operate at a global scale."
"On the subject of hedge funds, we base our views on the principle that their activity has to be regulated."
"We have said so in the Commission, the Council has said so, and the Washington meeting said so."
"The high level group chaired by Jacques de Larosière is analysing this, among other factors."
"Commissioner McCreevy met with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs yesterday."
"I saw the President of the Commission repeat to you in this Chamber, on his recent visits, that the Commission is going to regulate hedge funds, and that is what we shall do."
"What is being debated is to what extent, in which areas, and which parts of hedge fund activity have to be subjected to regulation, which will not only affect hedge funds."
"Important contributions to this debate are coming from the employment field and the report produced by this Parliament at Mr Rasmussen's initiative."
"I fully agree with those of you who have mentioned investment and the need to link the necessary investments in the medium and long term with the energy and climate change package."
"I agree with those who say that our monetary policy has room for manoeuvre, without having to jeopardise the independence of the European Central Bank or other central banks."
"It is obvious."
"Inflation in the euro area at the end of November, according to Eurostat, was 2.1%."
"Just a few months ago we were talking about inflation figures that were twice as high, and that margin is now being used."
"The Central Bank is meeting here in Brussels tomorrow."
"I do not know what it is going to do, but I have heard the statements made by the Bank's president, Mr Trichet, and they are quite clear on the subject."
"My next point concerns the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The pact clearly states that a deficit breaching the 3% threshold triggers the excessive deficit procedure, with a single exception, namely when the economic situation is exceptional, and we are in an economic situation that is exceptional."
"The second condition, which applies concurrently with the first, is that the excessive deficit should be temporary, and temporary does not mean several years but just one year."
"The third condition, concurrent with the first two, is that the excess should not take the deficit very far above the reference value, and here, Mr García-Margallo - without going into technical details unsuited to the predominantly lay audience in this House - we are talking about a few tenths of a percentage point."
"Lastly, in reply to Mr Parish and somebody else who mentioned the value-added tax issue, the Commission's document or plan includes a range of instruments that may be used to produce a fiscal stimulus, and one of them is certainly to cut such a substantial tax or, rather, the rate of such a substantial tax as VAT."
"It is also a fact, however, that the Commission is not forcing anyone to do that."
"Read the plan and you will see that there is no obligation involved, as indeed there could not be."
"A third point - and this is information arising from yesterday's Ecofin talks - is that only one Member State out of the 27 was in favour of using this instrument yesterday, and that was the Member State that has already used it."
"Thank you, Commissioner, especially for covering topics ranging from mathematics to theology."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - The financial crisis has created major challenges for the EU and the global economy."
"Coordinated efforts by Member States have been effective in stabilizing the EU banking system, but much remains to be done to contain the propagation of the crisis into the wider economy and protect households, businesses and jobs."
"In an interdependent world, tackling these challenges could be an opportunity for the EU to take the lead in bringing clarity, social responsibility and predictability to the global financial architecture."
"Any implementation of mitigation measures has to be timely, comprehensive and accompanied by appropriate regulatory action addressing the root causes of the crisis."
"Particular attention should be given to regulation regarding new financial products, such as sub-prime mortgages and their derivatives, as well as the entities that are involved in their marketing, such as banks, hedge funds and private equity."
"There is a need to review the business model of rating agencies and the legal standing of their ratings."
"In the recovery process we must give priority to solutions that protect jobs, growth and the most vulnerable, promote economic energy and stability, while ensuring that parties with vested interests in maintaining the status quo are kept at a distance."
"in writing. - (HU) I welcome the unified European efforts at addressing the crisis and the initiatives aimed at preserving European jobs and creating new ones."
"At the same time, I would like to call attention to the fact that countries that are in as dire a fiscal situation as Hungary do not have any monetary or significant fiscal or tax reduction tools at their disposal."
"Thus, in these countries, an economic stimulus is conceivable primarily in the form of a reallocation and efficient use of European resources as well as a reduction of payroll costs, improved efficiency of the regulation of competition and the reduction of administrative costs."
"I am particularly pleased that our combined efforts in this regard have the support of Commissioner Joaquín Almunia."
"For this reason, I consider the initiatives relating to structural funds to be of pre-eminent importance, and firmly support their acceptance without delay."
"An acceleration of the acceptance of the major projects, as well as support in the form of credits available to SMEs, can help stimulate demand."
"At the same time, I consider that our efforts on behalf of the neediest are still insufficient, and hence I urge that land development and new construction also be included in the changes being proposed in the area of housing support."
"In the underdeveloped regions and settlements, there are certain plots of land or developments that are unsuitable for renovation, and thus we need to promote the construction of up-to-date, energy efficient dwellings."
"In so doing, we can contribute to the European Union's objectives with regard to energy savings as well as job creation, while at the same time helping those most in need."
"in writing. - (PL) In announcing its crisis action plan, the European Commission responded to the real need for Community action to stabilise and revive the economy."
"However, the announcement was made a few days after the so-called conciliation, which determines the shape of the European Union's 2009 budget."
"The budget does not allocate additional funds for overcoming the crisis, and it is hard to imagine a plan of the order of EUR 200 billion being completely budget neutral."
"The long-fought argument about the sources of funds for the EUR 1 billion aid to famine threatened countries shows that it will not be easy to get 27 countries to agree to the additional funding, namely the over EUR 116 billion of payments agreed on 21 November between the European Parliament and the Council for 2009."
"If only for this reason, Mr Barroso's plan is no more than the sum of national efforts accompanied by promises of greater tolerance of budget deficits and state aid regulations."
"Nonetheless, I hope that any potential relaxation of the Stability and Growth Pact will not be the only outcome of the European Commission's plan."
"This will be the case if we carry out the promise of increasing advances and streamlining the structural funds which must act as local and industry-specific anti-crisis packages during 2009-2010."
"This would reverse the disastrous tendency to widen the gap between commitments and regional policy funds actually taken up."
"EU strategy on Roma (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the EU strategy on Roma."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council fully acknowledges the vital importance of taking appropriate measures with a view to improving the situation of the Roma and of promoting their fundamental rights, as this House requested in its resolution of 31 January."
"As you know, real progress has been made under the French Presidency in the areas of non-discrimination and inclusion and, in this context, it has been possible to take account of the situation of the Roma, not least within the package on the Social Agenda, as it was presented by Commissioner Špidla on 2 July."
"The aim of the package presented by the Commission is to give fresh impetus to policies to combat poverty, exclusion and discrimination affecting the most vulnerable groups, and, from this point of view, the proposals that were made by the Commission and that take stock of the existing instruments, which help ensure the greater inclusion of the Roma population, truly are a very good contribution."
"For its part, the Council regrets that the Member States were unable to agree as one on a package relating to the fight against poverty and social exclusion, in financial terms."
"I also wished to say this on the occasion of this debate."
"The first European summit on the Roma was held on 16 September."
"It was supported by the President of the Commission and by the French Presidency of the European Union."
"The declaration that was adopted underlines the Member States' responsibilities with a view to ensuring the meaningful inclusion of the Roma, by laying emphasis on the strengthening of people's individual rights and on the importance of the participation of Roma organisations."
"A second equality summit was held on 29 and 30 September 2008."
"During this summit we emphasised the problems with which the Roma population is all too often faced, be it in terms of access to education, jobs or vocational training, as well as access to other goods and services, and this enabled us to see how to act more effectively to combat the discrimination suffered by this population."
"We are also pleased with the inclusion of the situation of the Roma within the European Union and will ensure that this is one of the priorities of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"The French Presidency recently produced some draft conclusions relating to the specific situation of the Roma."
"These conclusions will be submitted to the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers and the General Affairs and External Relations Council next Monday and Tuesday."
"I shall give your Committee on Foreign Affairs an account of them on Tuesday."
"The draft conclusions call on the Commission and the Member States to take account of the situation of the Roma in the design and implementation of policies on the protection of fundamental rights, in the policy on combating poverty and discrimination, in policies on gender equality and in those on access to education, housing, health care, jobs, the law and culture."
"In these draft conclusions we call for the Commission and the Member States to identify tangible actions for 2009 and 2010."
"With this in view, provision is also made for better use of the Structural Funds."
"It is for this reason that the Council invites the Commission to present it, in 2010, with a report on the progress made, to continue discussions and to organise the necessary exchanges with the Roma organisations."
"That is what I wished to say to this House, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the first European summit on the Roma, which took place in Brussels on 16 September, was of fundamental importance for the partnership between the main actors in this area."
"It involved the participation of more than 500 senior representatives of EU bodies, Member States and non-governmental organisations and it was a reflection of our renewed determination to increase efforts to confront the social exclusion of Roma."
"There was a clear message that the overall aim must be to integrate the Roma fully into the economic, social and cultural life of Europe and to ensure equal opportunities for everyone in the EU, including Roma."
"Civil society must be fully engaged in this partnership."
"It follows from this that the Roma must participate in proposing, implementing and monitoring policies which apply to them."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the contribution made to the summit by non-governmental organisations, for example the declaration from the EU Roma Policy Coalition."
"Unprecedented progress has been achieved this year on Roma integration through the combined efforts of the EU and the Member States and through cooperation founded on mutual trust and good will."
"In the opinion of the Commission the most important conclusions of the summit were: the undertaking to promote the individual rights of Roma men, women and children; an acknowledgement of the fact that the EU and the Member States have a shared responsibility to support Roma integration in their different spheres of activity; an acknowledgement that the EU must support the Member States in carrying out their policies via coordination and financial support from the structural funds; a consensus that it is necessary to support culturally sensitive approaches focused on Roma which will promote their integration into the mainstream in terms of education, employment and communities without excluding other similarly disadvantaged members of society."
"The Commission also gave a clear message at the summit that it will take all essential steps within its sphere of activity towards improving the situation of Roma and that it would ensure that they are able to make full use of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter."
"The Commission will not hesitate to intervene where there is a breach of Community law, and that includes fundamental rights."
"In relation to the conclusions of the summit, President Barroso and I have proposed the creation of a platform for Roma inclusion."
"This would provide a framework for bilateral meetings at a high level so that, for example, financial instruments supporting the policies of cohesion and rural development may be better targeted at Roma integration."
"In addition to this, the platform would constitute a concrete fulfilment of the Commission's promise to make the instruments and policies of the Community more effective and to report on results achieved."
"In connection with the conclusions from the June meeting of the European Council, the Member States should now evaluate progress to date and increase their efforts towards full Roma integration."
"The Commission will of course support the Member States."
"Apart from this, the Commission is looking forward to the meeting of the Council for General Affairs on 8 December, at which proposals will be debated in respect of the conclusions on Roma integration."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, over the past year, significant progress has been made in gaining recognition at European level for the fact that the integration of the 10 million Roma living in destitution within the Member States, and the full realisation of their rights, is in the interest of all European societies."
"I feel that this process has now nevertheless ground to a halt."
"According to the European Parliament and non-governmental organisations, professional monitoring and European Community oversight are needed, for although the Member States have indicated in the plans submitted to the European Union their intention to integrate the Roma living within their borders, their nationally adopted budgets and the results to date do not support these declarations."
"The individual projects financed from EU sources have not yielded striking results."
"The exclusion of European Roma from the economy and from housing, their lack of access to quality education, the troubling health care indicators have not improved but rather deteriorated, and continue to weaken Europe's social cohesion."
"Professional efforts are needed that are much more comprehensive than the project-based approaches to date, and they must address both Roma and non-Roma society in order to develop the areas mentioned in a way that transcends parties and cycles."
"A fundamental condition for the success of these efforts is that future presidencies also commit themselves to the joint European actions prepared under the French Presidency."
"It is essential for immediate measures to be taken aimed at gaining acceptance for the Roma and harnessing their economic capacity in the service of European development."
"From the start of the cohesion policy until the enlargement of 2004, there were some successes, but to have to wait three more decades is far too long."
"This situation requires nothing less than crisis measures."
"The Roma ghettoes can only be eliminated by the reintegration of their several thousand inhabitants into the labour market, and by maximum use of new and undeveloped areas of the economy - such as renewable and alternative energy or environmental protection - and the creation of quality integrated education."
"The Roma's own identity, their national identity deriving from their home country and their social and economic identity must be strengthened simultaneously."
"The inclusion of a EUR 5 million pilot project in the 2009 budget guarantees that we can talk about this issue, but the process must not stop there."
"Instead of bilateral meetings, we need an EU strategy that can create new elements, legal foundations and potential sanctions as well as monetary mechanisms."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, in recent times, the European Parliament has emphatically spoken out in favour of developing a long-term strategy for the integration of the Roma in Europe."
"Over the past year, it has become clear that more needs to be done in this area, primarily by the Member States, but also by the European Union."
"The Council will soon be addressing this subject again."
"This alone is a sign that our Heads of Government set great political store by effective policy, with good reason, to counter discrimination of the Roma and their social and economic exclusion."
"This subject is also high on the Commission's agenda."
"In September, it organised the first Roma Summit, in which representatives of the Member States, the Commission itself and in particular representatives of the Roma civil society were given the opportunity to make recommendations regarding European Roma policy."
"As part of the European Roma strategy, a high-level political meeting should be an annual fixture with a view to checking progress on policy, exchanging positive experiences, but also - should this prove necessary - sounding critical notes."
"I hope that the Commissioner can commit to this today."
"More needs to be done, though."
"This is why the European Council has to set the Commission a clear and specific task to develop a broad, strategic and long-term policy framework in a bid to break the vicious circle of exclusion in which generations of European Roma are trapped."
"There is no reason to wait any longer with policy proposals."
"It is obvious what needs to be done: countless studies and policy recommendations have mapped out the bottlenecks."
"The resolutions of the European Parliament give a clear and specific summary of possible policy initiatives."
"Mr President, on 31 January, in this very Chamber, we adopted with a large majority the Parliament's resolution clearly requesting the European Commission to create an EU Roma strategy."
"Education, housing, employment and health were identified as four priority areas in which material and human resources were to be provided."
"The Commission statement we have just heard is not a very convincing statement, and I must say honestly it reminded me eerily of the propaganda statements of Eastern European socialist dictatorships."
"As in those days, so today we hear of nothing but success, development and other positive messages, while in reality the Roma are still living in camps and ghettoes, are daily confronted by humiliation, discrimination and in the worst case by racist attacks, as a result of which nearly 30 thousand Roma from Italy alone are wandering across the territory of the European Union seeking a home at last in one of the Member States."
"Mr President, I am holding in my hand a letter from Vice-President Barrot dated 6 November, in which he assures me and four of my fellow Members that - and I quote - 'regarding the EU Roma strategy we can be sure that he will work closely with Commissioner Špidla to see that it meets the expectations of Roma non-governmental organisations'."
"However, there is no mention of a strategy, but only of a Roma integration platform."
"How can this be explained?"
"Regarding the European Roma summit, I have heard only criticism from the non-governmental organisations of the fact that they expected far more from this historic summit, and that they were not included in the preparations."
"But I will go even further: it is still not clear how the Berlusconi government has reported to the European Commission on the results of the fingerprinting."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commission, Council, this discussion is a bit hypocritical."
"We must call a spade a spade."
"We have a problem with the Roma, and this is that they are strongly rejected in most societies to varying degrees."
"Italy was mentioned, the Czech Republic and Romania are familiar with examples of real pogroms, racist attacks."
"In this situation the European Union should do one thing, namely, give the Roma the status of a European minority."
"In other words, official recognition is the first step towards combating exclusion."
"Secondly, we should then develop a strategy with the Roma which must, however, comprise two parts. A strategy for the Roma who are settled, and a strategy for the Roma who travel around."
"For the travellers cannot be made to settle by force or those who are settled made to travel."
"It is a difficult problem."
"I was responsible for Roma in Frankfurt for six years and I know how difficult the day-to-day work is."
"But the fundamental problem is - and that is why what has been said about the organisation is also correct: if we do not establish structures with the representatives of Roma organisations, we will fail because we will always talk paternalistically about their problems and not try to solve their problems together with them - including their objections."
"We talk about schools, for example."
"However, there are Roma families who do not want to send their children to school, and others who do want to send them to school."
"These are different problems."
"I therefore agree that we should stop giving such positive status reports as 'We are concerned' and 'We have programmes' and so on, when we know that it does not work."
"In short: firstly acknowledge the problem more clearly and secondly integrate the Roma organisations into the process more radically."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with the approach adopted by the Commission with regard to Roma."
"I understand the pragmatic approach free of any political and ideological implications, an approach - as President Barroso said at the summit held in Brussels on 16 September - which needs all leaders to be involved, without exclusion, from the Roma community to the public authorities, headed by the European Commission."
"Policies on Roma certainly come under the remit of Member States, but it is a good thing that they are finally being coordinated at Community level."
"Good practices should be coordinated and the use of funds be monitored on a regular basis."
"How many resources have been squandered over the last few years?"
"How many opportunities have been lost?"
"Looking at the real situation and taking account of proper exceptions, the budget is unfortunately in deficit."
"Too many funds have not been used, too many have been wasted on measures and projects which have produced no results."
"If we want to be serious about this, we cannot pretend that this has not happened."
"In this respect, we can really say: 'whoever is without sin, cast the first stone'."
"The Commission has produced a useful document for Member States."
"Everyone must now do their bit, starting off by relentlessly combating every form of racism and discrimination and advocating serious integration policies, which will primarily have three priority areas: education, vaccinations and health care, as well as professional training and work start programmes, also using micro-credit funds."
"But we should ask the Roma people to assume their responsibilities."
"Just let me give you an example."
"We must absolutely stop tolerating Roma parents forcing their children to beg, taking them out of educational activities to do so."
"Exploitation and illegal activities cannot be tolerated at all in any form."
"It is only by combining solidarity, integration and respect for regulations that we can find the right strategy for resolving these problems."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the resolution was approved by this Parliament, we went to visit Roma camps and we were able to see with our own eyes how they welcome people and how they live."
"We visited the camps in Rome and we were able to ascertain that, in reality, Roma really need special protection, if only because since the EU's expansion, they have become one of the larger minorities in the European Union."
"We need to ensure that this minority is recognised as a European minority for all intents and purposes."
"The efforts which have been undertaken during these last few years have been disorganised and have not been coordinated by the European Union."
"So much money has been squandered and has failed to make any structural and lasting improvements to the Roma's situation, especially in areas such as education, housing and employment."
"We witness racial discrimination on a daily basis, both at local level and in programmes which are not geared towards integration."
"We also constantly witness discrimination by the police or even racial stereotyping by governments, which are thinking about registering Roma using fingerprinting or other forms of registration."
"There is a real campaign of criminalisation being conducted in Europe against the Roma community."
"Every day we hear statements from political figures which are tending towards this, from both right and left."
"I hope that Mrs Angelilli can convince the leader of her party, who is also President of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, that Roma can be integrated, contrary to what he has said in public."
"(NL) Mr President, I apologise to the previous speaker, but the proposition that the major problems involved in living with Roma can simply be reduced to discrimination or prejudice may be politically correct but, in reality, it does not hold water at all."
"Roma people themselves stand by a number of customs that are difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with the basic standards that apply in most European countries."
"Huge unemployment among the adults and the shocking levels of school absenteeism among Roma children are not in the first instance the result of any discrimination whatsoever."
"Last week, the Italian Court of Cassation decided that begging by gypsies forms an integral part of the Roma culture and cannot, therefore, be prohibited."
"I wonder where this is going to take us."
"As for me, I would argue in favour of a very respectful and humane, but at the same time unambiguous, approach."
"Anyone who wishes to live in our society should respect its laws and standards."
"Begging, keeping children from basic health care, or worse, systematic school absenteeism, are altogether wrong in our society."
". - (HU) Mr President, today's debate is part of a process, in which important decisions remain to be taken, and hence I emphasise once again that one may safely refer to the living conditions of the largest minority in Europe as comparable to that of the developing world."
"They can, of course, be further denigrated by claiming that it is their own fault, whereas it is precisely their educational, housing, health and employment situation that resembles that of the developing world."
"Without immediate, concentrated and targeted external assistance, these 10-12 million people have no chance to break out of their poverty and exclusion."
"This degree of social exclusion impedes the basic fulfilment of the Roma's human dignity and equal opportunity."
"Europe is already several decades past the time when it could contemplate from a distance the fact that alongside such great economic potential, there could be such large numbers of people on its territory living from generation to generation in social exclusion."
"At no stage did economic development on its own open up a true path of mobility to those at the bottom of the social ladder."
"Our responsibility is shared, first of all because the situation of the Roma has not changed fundamentally in the new Member States after enlargement or in the candidate countries while awaiting enlargement."
"At the same time, anti-Romani sentiment is becoming an increasingly open rallying cry for extremist views in Europe, one to which we must call a halt."
"The fact that the topic has been placed on the agenda indicates that there is much for us to do: Commissioner Špidla has enumerated many of the tasks ahead, supplemented by my fellow Members."
"Let us combine our tasks, and the topic will be before Parliament again in February."
"- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, as the shadow rapporteur of the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs I would like to express my enormous appreciation for the work of both the Commission and the rapporteur in seeking so diligently for a positive solution to the problem of one of the minorities within the European Union."
"The debate showed, I am afraid, that the words of Commissioner Špidla were either poorly translated or poorly understood by either Mrs Mohácsi or Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"I come from the Czech Republic, a country that has been frequently and in my view quite unfairly criticised in this context and which has had a lot of experience with the problem."
"On the basis of this I would like to make four points."
"I agree with the Commission that the problem can be resolved only by linking up regional, national and European structures to the greatest extent possible."
"Secondly, I agree with the opinion that we currently have enough instruments for carrying through integration policies."
"Thirdly, I would like to express my fundamental agreement with the opinion of the Commission and some of my fellow MEPs that the key to a successful solution also depends on the cooperation of the Roma minority representatives themselves."
"Mr President, the Roma are a pan-European ethno-cultural community with dramatic social and economic problems."
"These problems should be addressed primarily by the European Union, through an appropriate common policy which requires clear legal bases."
"We cannot turn into reality the fiction of the Roma national citizenship when Roma opt out from taking the nationality of a particular state."
"Roma are European citizens without a national project."
"Therefore the models usually applying to the national minorities at the level of the nation state do not work."
"Roma social and cultural integration is a transnational matter and consequently it is first and foremost the responsibility of the European Union."
"Of course, Member States also have their responsibility concerning Roma in terms of non-discrimination, social inclusion and affirmative local measures."
"But these responsibilities should be seen as having a subsidiary character."
"When the Commission emphasises that the main responsibility lies with the Member States, in fact it refuses to undertake its natural responsibilities and goes back to a model which has been proven to be inefficient."
"We must establish, we must create, a European public space for Roma, a mechanism for effective participation of Roma in policymaking and policy implementation."
"Without that we cannot really solve the problem."
"We cannot have a real strategy."
"(HU) In spite of the fact that the European institutions have shown their commitment to respecting European values and fundamental rights and to combating discrimination, the real picture of the integration of the Roma within Europe is discouraging."
"The majority of Roma in Europe live in poor social conditions and the problems they struggle with have remained unchanged for years; the chief of these are the problems of social exclusion, lack of employment, school segregation and the multiple disadvantages faced by Roma women."
"At a time of economic crisis in Europe, it is easy to seek a scapegoat among the representatives of the most vulnerable social groups, and hence violent actions against the Roma are multiplying, targeting innocent people with attacks that have had fatal consequences on more than one occasion."
"In such a situation, the solution is not to collect fingerprints in an ethnically discriminatory manner, or to form law enforcement bodies or militias whose actions are intended to instil fear in decent people in order to frighten them away."
"The real answer is a European Roma strategy, built on five areas: education, employment, housing, health and active participation in society on the part of the Roma."
"Without such a European Roma policy, there can be no national Roma policy either."
"(SK) The European Union has an obligation to adopt a strategy on Roma, although the Member States should also be more active in this area."
"I myself live in a Slovak region where Roma make up around 10% of the population."
"Thanks to this, I am intimately familiar with their specific socially disadvantaged situation."
"The main responsibility lies on the shoulders of local self-government representatives, who are often left alone to deal with very complex issues, related primarily to employment, as a consequence of the Roma population's low level of education."
"If we are to find balanced solutions, we must involve in the dialogue first and foremost representatives of the Roma minority who are intimately familiar with the problems of this community."
"Only then can our solutions be effective."
"The European Social Fund is the most important instrument for people's integration into the labour market."
"I call on the Member States to ensure that excessive administrative obstacles do not discourage NGOs and local self-governments from seeking European Social Fund funding for projects which assist in the effective resolution of the Roma issue."
"(BG) I support, in principle, the position of the Commission."
"In spite of the often discussed problem concerning the Roma community, we still have not found the most apt solutions which would lead to their lasting integration into society."
"In my opinion, this applies for all Member States."
"The base cause continues to be the ethnocentricity of the problem."
"It is as if we have 'ethnicised' the social problems of the Roma and treated these as problems solely belonging to a separate ethnic group."
"We need to change approach."
"Yes, an overwhelming section of Roma are poor and do not have access to shelter and adequate education, however these problems do not apply only to them."
"The combination of these social problems into one separate, ethnic one leads to open discrimination."
"Because of this, their integration has become more complicated, more intensive and solving their problems has become more difficult."
"Therefore it is important that we implement a policy for the protection of individual rights and that we have a base instrument: subsidisation."
"In Bulgaria we have a large number of problems which we associate with the Roma and this has driven us to introduce steps for the preparation of a framework programme to resolve the social preconditions causing their ethnic discrimination."
"We offer an exchange of positions on the base elements of the framework programme with other Member States to whom this is a problem of considerable extent."
"(NL) There is, to my mind, a likeness between the Roma issue and the issue of race in the United States."
"Whilst they have managed to resolve it - partly at least - and they have made good headway with Obama's victory, the scandal - for want of a better word - still persists in Europe."
"Why did we all adopt this resolution in the plenary here in January?"
"There was a good reason for it."
"The resolution stated, among other things, that we are in favour of a Roma unit within the Commission, a European Roma strategy, a general approach involving cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, as well as a Roma to Roma approach, as developed by the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe)."
"Nothing has come of it, except a summit meeting where there was even more talk without cooperation from, or with, the Roma."
"I can tell you that the Roma community, with whom I have enjoyed ten years of close cooperation, was extremely disappointed with the result."
"I am sorry, Commissioner Špidla, that I cannot enthuse about your platform, which is yet another forum for debate, albeit at high level, in the framework of bilateral meetings."
"We have done plenty of talking."
"If there is anything we need, it is action."
"I recently read an article that started with the words: we are about to have a bloodbath."
"There are uniformed vigilante patrols in a number of European States who provoke the Roma people."
"Should we wait until we get situations like those in Italy, where entire camps go up in flames?"
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to apologise to the House and to the President for arriving so late, particularly as I am the one who is always warning colleagues in our Group to be punctual."
"Therefore it is doubly embarrassing for me."
"I should like to make just one observation."
"I have listened to both Mr Jouyet and the Commissioner."
"We agree fully on the objectives, but the urgency, the insistence of the European Union with regard to the Member States - and also to the candidates or potential candidates - is not strong enough."
"What we have recently seen in Belgrade and in other countries, for example, but also within the European Union, has already been mentioned."
"It is scandalous that we are still talking about Roma camps today."
"Therefore, I would urgently request both the representative of the Council as well as the Commission to warn and call on the Member States more strongly to perform their tasks in full at last."
"The picture is not as rosy as it is sometimes depicted here."
"I am grateful to Mr Cohn-Bendit for being so tolerant as to let me speak."
"I am chairing this sitting, not Mr Cohn-Bendit."
"We just moved to the catch-the-eye procedure."
"That is why you took the floor, so there are no privileges at all."
"Mr President, I would like to say that this has been an extremely important debate for the Council."
"What I have taken from it is that, as many of you have emphasised, the Roma as a group are disadvantaged, and are very vulnerable to poverty, discrimination and racist attacks."
"That has been said, and unfortunately it is true, as many of you have emphasised."
"As Mr Severin, Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mrs Mohácsi all quite rightly said, it is also clear that we must not harbour false optimism, and that the strategy will be extremely difficult to implement."
"As you stressed, in our daily work, we need to make a distinction between those who have become sedentary and those who remain nomadic."
"They are not the same thing: their practices and living conditions are not the same."
"In day-to-day practice, even though we really want to help, it truly is very difficult in reality."
"We must not fall prey to naïve optimism: we need to take determined, ongoing action, and I would say to you, Mr Severin, that the fact that the work of the Council in this area was initiated by Romania is also a good sign and that the fact that the Council has taken up this issue at the behest of your countrymen is extremely important."
"In my view, we need to be aware that we have a long road ahead of us: we need to be clear about that, as you have been."
"I think that the only possible response is, as has been said, to set up structures and associations."
"That is what we are trying to do, but it is, indeed, extremely difficult."
"Second, as you have underlined, it is vital that we take a European approach to this, not least because it is very much a cross-border problem, not at all a purely national one."
"It is also obvious, though - and I am saying this for the Commission and in relation to the comments made - that we have to be quite clear about the fact that the Member States also have specific responsibilities in this matter."
"We can only take legislative initiatives at European level if they fall under the competences granted to the Union in the Treaties today."
"We must - and I would say this both to Mrs Angelilli and to Mrs Járóka - also take real action at national level."
"To summarise, therefore, I think that, this year, we have seen a growing recognition of the phenomenon - even if, as you will admit, it has been too slow."
"I am not sure if we need to follow up on what has been said, and on what basis we can do so, regarding the problem of minorities."
"Moreover, the Council must continue its work and, above all, the Member States' actions and the measures actually taken both at national and local level must be stepped up, because the current situation is inhumane and unacceptable."
"We also need to recognise, though, that this really is a very complex problem in practice."
"Many thanks for your comments."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission considers the situation of the Roma to be ethically and politically pressing and it is of course prepared to do everything within its power to contribute towards a cohesive approach and to strengthen synergies both at a European level and at a level of the policies of the Member States, in order for the Member States to focus more on developing policies aimed at the inclusion of the Roma rather than policies which often lead to their continuing exclusion."
"The Commission is pushing for the Member States to tackle this in a culturally sensitive way, taking account of the special needs of the Roma but at the same time striving to give them access to the mainstream, to education, the labour market and housing."
"The Commission, however, cannot pretend that it is able to represent the Member States in this area, as this would be not only ineffective but also unfair."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is clearly a need to redouble our efforts but, despite the fact that we are still far from achieving our goal, it is clear that things are beginning to move, since the first European forum on the Roma in itself marks a change."
"The fact that the Roma question is being taken up by the European Union and that this will now be a regular issue at the highest levels also marks a change."
"If we can get the Roma platform up and running efficiently we will have established a proper foundation from which we will be able to monitor developments, provide suggestions and provide far better policy coordination than has hitherto been the case."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to return to the beginning of my speech."
"The Commission considers the situation of the Roma to be ethically and politically pressing and it will do everything within its abilities and powers."
"The debate is closed."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"We need to recognise that sufficient progress has not been made in integrating Roma since the Commission launched its first appeal to this effect in 2005."
"An initial step towards this would be to create a policy for promoting education for Roma."
"This policy has to be handled not only by the state, but also by non-governmental organisations which no longer need to make it their main objective to identify acts of discrimination, but to educate ethnic groups."
"This solution is not only based on making the public authorities face up to their responsibilities, but the Roma communities as well."
"Some of the causes of unemployment which Roma face are due to illiteracy, a lack of education and professional qualifications, not to mention a lack of access to information."
"Educational reform for this ethnic group can be carried out in three ways: reducing the level of illiteracy, ensuring studies are completed, and professional specialisation and reconversion."
"This reform needs to respect Roma's specific culture and traditions, while also linking the education system to the values of European culture and civilisation."
"I invite the Commission to draw up a single plan for integrating Roma at European level, based on cooperation between existing inter-governmental and NGO projects."
"This also includes projects involving representatives from educational institutions."
"The aim should be to raise the status of access to high-quality education so that it becomes a basic objective of the Community's policies."
"Israel's participation in Community programmes - Israel's participation in Community programmes (debate)"
"The next item is a joint debate on:"
"the report by Mrs De Keyser, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Euro Mediterranean Association Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part and the State of Israel of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Community and the State of Israel on the general principles governing the State of Israel's participation in Community programmes (05471/2008 - C6-0180/2008 - and"
"Council and Commission statements concerning the State of Israel's participation in Community programmes."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, we asked in plenary for the vote to be deferred, and I am delighted about that, but, as rapporteur, I feel I need to explain myself."
"As Mr Salafranca pointed out earlier, it is quite correct that, on 6 November, Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted two proposals on Israel's participation in Community programmes: one was an assent, and the other a resolution."
"Both proposals were adopted by a huge majority - the vote on the resolution was actually unanimous."
"What did these texts contain, and what message did the Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to send Israel?"
"The assent was positive: it agreed to Israel's participation in the Community programme, given that it was already participating in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research, that its application related solely to the 'innovation and technology' programme, that all member countries of the neighbourhood policy are entitled to apply to participate, and thus that it constituted neither a special favour to Israel nor a reassessment of its political status."
"The association agreements are based on respect for human rights."
"Members therefore wanted to provide a political framework for this assent in the form of a very decisive resolution calling for recognition of the interim association agreement between the European Union and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), for stronger control of and sanctions against imports of Israeli products from the occupied territories under the preferential importation scheme, and for the results of scientific cooperation to be used for civilian purposes."
"The Commission should produce an annual report enabling Parliament to assess compliance with these conditions."
"In short, the resolution was positive but firm, and was the result of long negotiations with the various parties, who have shown exemplary commitment to the compromise reached, for which I thank them."
"So, why are we now hesitating, raising our fears and, ultimately, deferring the vote?"
"Essentially, Mr President, because the humanitarian situation in Gaza has become intolerable."
"When the European Parliament's delegation, of which I was a part, went to Gaza in early summer, the living conditions of the people there were already alarming; another delegation went to the occupied territories in November, and came back with exactly the same report."
"Nothing is moving, the situation is catastrophic, and the blockade, far from weakening Hamas, has radicalised it."
"Three days ago, Louis Michel pointed out that the continued closure of Gaza's crossing points was a form of collective punishment of Palestinian civilians, contrary to international humanitarian law: it was our own Commissioner who said that."
"The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the agency that works with refugees in Gaza, has launched appeals for aid, as have Oxfam, Amnesty International, Médecins sans frontières and a number of other NGOs that cannot even use the Erez crossing at the moment."
"Just today, I learned that our Pegase instrument has completely stopped working in Gaza, that it can no longer guarantee energy supplies, that the salaries and pensions of officials in the Palestinian Authority are no longer being paid, and that payments to the poorest people have also been suspended."
"The UNRWA has also had to suspend its programme of aid to the poorest people in Gaza."
"This is unacceptable, Mr President, it cannot be tolerated, and it is why I, against my will, supported deferring this vote."
"Right now, the political 'upgrading' of Israel is being discussed at Council level in a great rush and in complete obscurity; and it is precisely this opportunity for upgrading that, today, right now, stands out in the political context of the region and is earning us hundreds and hundreds of e-mails from citizens."
"The Council therefore needs to improve transparency concerning the debates currently in progress and to be answerable to the citizens of Europe."
"For Parliament today, it is quite clear: we want humane living conditions for Palestinians and an end to the blockade of Gaza."
"This blockade is doing nothing to weaken Hamas, but causes intolerable suffering for innocent people, half of whom, by the way, voted for Fatah in the 2006 elections."
"That vote is, in fact, still valid."
"We are holding out our hand to Israel, but we will not give up the core values on which the European Union is built."
"The ball is now in Israel's court."
"I will take this opportunity - and I apologise, Mr President, you can deduct this time from my two minutes later - I will take this opportunity to condemn the political pressure, slanderous campaigns and accusations of anti-Semitism that have been levelled at Members who are simply standing up for peace and justice."
"I would also pay tribute to all our Jewish friends, both in Israel and elsewhere, these new righteous men who, in extremely difficult conditions, also want peace and call for compliance with international law."
"Let us work together to achieve this."
"We need to break the siege of Gaza, and taking a military approach to this, as I have heard recommended, would be pure madness."
"Mr President, Mr Verheugen, Mrs De Keyser, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs De Keyser for this excellent report."
"Like her, I too observed that, earlier, a majority in Parliament voted to defer the vote for the reasons she raised."
"From the Council's point of view, Israel's participation in the Community programme needs to be seen from the perspective of the upgrading of the Union's bilateral relations with Israel, in which regard the Council sent a signal on 16 June at the 8th Association Council with Israel."
"This upgrading fits in with the strengthening of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"The Council is convinced that this upgrading benefits both parties, and is not only in the interests of the country that we are bringing closer to the European family."
"It also serves Europe's interests, in that it allows us to forge closer links and greater trust with new sections of the Israeli population, be it its students, its researchers, its businesses or its technicians."
"Europe will thus be in a position to provide concrete proof of the benefits of multilateral cooperation in the form of peace and prosperity."
"I would say to Mrs De Keyser that such lessons come at a price in a region such as the Middle East."
"Europe will thus be able to speak the truth more forcefully and more credibly, which will engender greater trust."
"I have listened closely, in this respect, to the expectations expressed, according to Mrs De Keyser, within the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I am referring, of course, to the message she mentioned on the complete and immediate freezing of settlement, on the need for progress on the peace process with the Palestinian Authority, on lifting the restrictions on the people of Gaza and the West Bank, and on the vital need to improve the lot of the people of Gaza affected by the blockade, as the European Parliament's delegation saw recently."
"Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that these expectations are shared by the Council and, I am sure, the Commission."
"In this respect, the declaration of 16 June 2008 includes some very clear statements both on the political context surrounding the upgrading and on the messages that Europe intends to send to Israel on this occasion."
"It is true that Israel has been aware of these messages for years, as you know."
"I am among those who find it regrettable that these messages have not been listened to properly, but the Council's gamble in June was to make use of the upgrading of bilateral relations to send the messages with greater force, at a higher level, and to a greater variety of contacts."
"That is what the Council is doing."
"You also raised the point that Europe's invitation to join certain Community programmes has been extended not only to Israel but to all countries in the neighbourhood policy, including in that region."
"Mr President, Mr Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has the opportunity today to make a contribution to the process of regional cooperation that Europe has launched in a region critical to its own security and prosperity."
"I hope that, when the time comes, in view of the vote taken just now, you will follow the recommendation proposed by your rapporteur and that, in the resolution you wish to adopt in the same connection on the positions set out on this subject on the fringes of the Association Council, you will support the positions that, the Presidency is convinced, reflect a wise balance that has been a long time in the making between the governments of the Member States and that serves the cause of peace and stability in the region."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in December 2006 the Commission proposed fully integrating the partners in the European Neighbourhood Policy into the implementation of certain policies and into a series of Community programmes."
"Fields such as research and development, innovation, competitiveness, consumer protection and information society, to name but a few, were at the forefront of our considerations."
"The Council has taken up this proposal on several occasions."
"In March 2007 it supported the Commission's proposal that all partner countries should always be enabled to participate in certain Community programmes."
"Israel is the first of our partner countries in the Neighbourhood Policy which this year formally concluded a protocol on a framework agreement with the European Community on the general principles of its participation in Community programmes."
"The Commission welcomes this outcome because it underlines our long-standing, close collaboration with our partner Israel."
"Since 1995 Israel has held full associate status in the Framework Programme for Research and Development."
"Over the years, this close collaboration has led to many joint projects, incidentally with substantial results, which I was able to see for myself on the spot in Israel last year."
"The high quality of Israeli researchers and Israeli universities makes Israel a highly interesting and valued partner."
"In the field of innovation too, Israel can make a significant contribution, which is advantageous for both sides because in the medium term the way will be opened for much closer industrial cooperation."
"Meanwhile, the dialogue initiated at that time by Prime Minister Olmert and myself between companies from the EU and Israel has got off to a good start and is producing results."
"Furthermore, Israel is already taking part in the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme, one of the three pillars of our competitiveness and integration programme."
"That is a programme of particular importance for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Both sides are combining great expectations and hopes with strengthened cooperation."
"Therefore, the last EU-Israel Association Council last year underlined that it wanted to intensify relations with Israel based on the Common Action Plan."
"Without doubt our relations are capable of expansion."
"Everything which contributes to making it easier for people to meet, bringing together journalists, artists, researchers and entrepreneurs, everything which serves dialogue and promotes mutual understanding, deserves our unconditional support."
"This will have a positive effect on our existing dialogue on human rights."
"The further strengthening of our relations with Israel, a heartland in the European Neighbourhood Policy, is in the strategic interest of the European Union."
"The Council decision discussed here today fits in this context, thus making an important contribution to the strengthening of our cooperation with Israel."
"I therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the draft resolution and to vote for the Commission's proposal."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I consider what has taken place today to be an unprecedented use of parliamentary procedure."
"Our Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was prepared to support fully the socialists' report, including the socialists' amendment proposals."
"It was the socialists themselves who refused to vote on their own report."
"The report has nevertheless been passed by the Committee for Foreign Affairs, it is on the table and it is essential to vote on the report within the lifetime of this Parliament."
"Our group is fully determined to debate and adopt the report."
"That which took place today damages Europe."
"Europe wanted to secure a return on its financial donations, it wanted to secure influence in the Middle East and it wanted to secure a chance to contribute to the peace process."
"Today we have thrown away an instrument that would have put us into this position in return for our money."
"Europe has also thrown away a major support in the area of research and development, it has thrown away a support linked to the development of science, research and technology, the fight against terrorism and the improvement of human rights in the Mediterranean region."
"I believe that talks on an action plan, as proposed by the Commission and the Council, will continue."
"I also believe that, under the Presidency of my own country, there will be an improvement in relations between Europe and Israel."
"But the case remains that our Parliament has thrown away its influence through becoming today a place where dark, non-European forces have triumphed, forces that do not want the situation in the Middle East to improve."
"And I believe it is absurd to place the European Parliament in opposition to our own states and our own intentions."
"We will therefore continue."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Hybášková, let us keep our feet on the ground."
"You have also considered that we will not vote today."
"We should really stick to the facts."
"As the Social Democrat Group, we are right behind the rapporteur and also voted in favour in the committee as a result of our conviction on the matter."
"The Vice-President of the Commission and you yourself have actually said that too."
"However, we are not living in a hermetically sealed room, we are living in a political situation."
"Imagine if we simply did not agree with anything you or I said with regard to this catastrophic, inhuman situation in Gaza and behaved as if nothing were happening there?"
"However, that is not the reality of the situation."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have said this is a contribution to peace."
"Do you really think that in the current situation it is a contribution to peace."
"It is possible that the situation will not change, unfortunately."
"We will vote at some point, although the situation is not serious."
"However, we must at least send a signal."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the question remains unanswered: how do people think it will be received in the region as a whole?"
"How do people think it will be received in Palestine and in other countries if at precisely this time we reach an agreement with Israel as the first country, while on the other hand human rights are being brutally trampled under foot, not only by Israel."
"It is quite clear - our Group has always ascertained this - that any kind of terrorism, be it rockets or other attacks, is to be utterly condemned."
"Our Group has supported this motion by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left because we want to give a signal at least once at this time that we simply cannot accept this situation in the Middle East."
"Yes, this cooperation will take place."
"Do not worry, you know quite clearly that this cooperation will take place and that that is not the end of a process but a clear signal."
"Yes, we want cooperation with Israel, but we also want peace in this region at last and no repression of the people."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Commissioner, Mr Jouyet, as it befits a responsible group, we have long discussed the question whether or not we should vote to defer the vote on both the draft resolution and the approval of the protocol; opinions in our group were divided."
"It was about 50/50, with a small majority to vote after all, and so my group was divided when it voted on this matter."
"This divided stance can partly be attributed to our great concern with regard to the situation in the Middle East and with regard to the conflict between Israel and Palestine."
"I do not know anybody, myself included, who has visited the occupied territory and has not returned filled with great concern, great compassion and anger in respect of the situation that exists over there."
"What is most disconcerting and alarming is that, since the Annapolis Agreements, Israeli policy has only become worse, stricter and tougher."
"You do not need to be of ill will to wonder whether Israel, or some forces within that country, backed by the Israeli army, is not in the process of creating irreversible situations within the occupied territories, to such an extent that a two-state solution becomes unattainable."
"I can therefore understand that we wanted to send a message to Israel by deferring the vote, because we do not want to create the impression that we are rewarding that country in a time when the day-to-day situation is deteriorating for more than a million Palestinians who live in Gaza."
"I hope that, in the coming weeks and months, changes will take place such that we will be able to approve both texts with more confidence."
"Mr President, it is facts that count, not words."
"Facts are worth a thousand times more than words."
"We have adopted many resolutions in this Parliament."
"Yes, there have been criticisms and good intentions in many of the resolutions that we have adopted, but the facts are more important."
"It is a fact that a year of talks within the Annapolis process has failed."
"It is a fact that the settlement process is continuing."
"It is a fact that the situation in Gaza is worse than ever."
"It is also a fact that today, while we are talking, there are confrontations going on between settlers and the Israeli army itself."
"I want to be able to vote on this resolution in a few months' time."
"I want us to be able to deepen our relations with the State of Israel."
"That is because the true friends of Israel, those of us who love Israel, dare to speak the truth."
"The truth is that the occupation as it exists today cannot continue any longer."
"It cannot go on any longer."
"We have to send out the message that the European Union's actions are conditional on a process of peace and basic respect for human rights."
"In that way we will be able to move ahead."
"We do want more and better relations with Israel and with the Palestinians, and we have to demonstrate that through clear conditions and clear actions, and not just words."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has not been easy asking for the vote to be postponed, but I think that it has been a necessary measure which I really believe will do the European Parliament credit."
"Israel cannot always be above complying with international laws."
"I would like to say to Mrs Hybášková that cooperation with Israel and the various projects have not been terminated at this point."
"It is simply the upgrading of relations which has been blocked and suspended, not cooperation, which is still forging ahead."
"I just hope that it can continue because it is important; even I can acknowledge its benefit."
"But I would like to reiterate: Israel needs to understand that it must comply with international laws."
"It is our honour and dignity which are also at stake."
"I would therefore hope that the Council of Ministers listens to the European Parliament and shows some consistency for once by telling Israel that it must provide some concrete signs indicating that it wants peace and that it should lift the blockade against the West Bank settlements, which is affecting the living conditions of Gaza's citizens."
"Our European Union projects have been blocked."
"For instance, the Pegaso project has stopped."
"It is hindered by the blockades preventing goods from entering the area."
"Tomorrow salaries will not be paid."
"The UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) is obliged to block aid to the poorest families."
"It is disgraceful that this is happening!"
"I am not, however, specifically criticising Israel; far from it!"
"Being friends with Israel also means making it face up to its own responsibilities and our own."
"I therefore hope we can start again, but the message we have given today is important."
"We have given it to the Palestinians and to all those Israelis who firmly believe in peace, but in peace with justice under law."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am happy to endorse all efforts on the part of the Council and Commission to intensify relations with the Jewish State of Israel in our mutual interest; deferring the vote is, to my mind, sending them entirely the wrong message."
"Despite this, I am facing the President-in-Office of the Council with very mixed feelings, due to the leaking of a Council document to the daily Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz - see last Monday's edition."
"Based on the leaked document, I should like to put three questions to him."
"Do you agree that the title of that document, 'An action strategy for peace in the Middle East', is the way forward?"
"If so, would you force Israel to reopen Palestinian institutions, including Orient House in Jerusalem?"
"Finally, I should like to ask you, if that is what the strategy is like, how do you intend to combine it with improving relations with the newly elected Israeli Government, whatever form that may take?"
"I look forward to your responses."
"- (IT) Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, this time I do not agree because I would argue that Parliament has given a bad impression today by referring Mrs De Keyser's report back to committee - and you will all certainly agree, especially with convening the debate and then the vote at such incredible speed."
"This makes me think that the left intended, as a bit of an excuse, to block Israel's access to the partnership programme for innovation and research."
"I would just like to emphasise here that we are talking about one of the few states, if not the only one, where offering it support is not only a sign of solidarity, but also entails growth and development for companies in Europe itself."
"No one has yet been able to ask the Palestinian Authority how much support it receives from the Arab League and how it uses it, nor what part of this contributes to dialogue, mutual understanding, as well as cultural and scientific development."
"I must say, given that so few of the excessive number of centre-right members have been mobilised, the left did a good job, under the pretext of protecting human rights, in achieving its success with the vote."
"I get the impression, however, that all of this is hindering regional development and perhaps even the peace process."
"If anything, it calls into question a state's right to security, a right which we should safeguard."
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs who have spoken before me have given a good explanation of the purpose of the package that we have set out this morning to vote to postpone."
"But I would like to remind you that there are additional aspects to these relations, especially the political aspects, which are being examined by the Council in this development in relations between the European Union and Israel."
"There are then those that affect the internal market."
"I therefore believe that we are all basically in favour of this development in relations between Israel and the European Union, in the same way as we are in favour of the development in relations with the Palestinian Authority."
"This report, however, must contain clarity and commitments from both sides."
"As things stand today, we cannot say that these criteria are being met."
"I would like to remind you not only of the tragic situation in Gaza, but also of the continuing illegal settlement in the territories."
"This is an issue which affects the marketing of products from the occupied territories and other matters which we are very familiar with."
"In my view, the Council must basically make its position clearly understood, if only because it seems to me that the French Presidency has undertaken to present at the next Council meeting a document on the prospects for peace in the Middle East."
"This may be of great interest to us, even as an opportunity to develop constructive relations."
"For this reason, I believe that it was a wise decision to request this postponement, providing that we all manage to use this time to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian population, especially in Gaza."
"I would like to add that we should also use the time to rebuild relations between Europe and the United States on the basis of a joint initiative on resolving the situation in the Middle East."
"Do not forget that 2008 was declared - or would have been - the year of the Constitution of the State of Palestine."
"2008 is over and the situation is still awful."
"Mr President, if the debate today had had as its subject the situation in the Gaza Strip, I might have joined Mrs De Keyser and all the other colleagues across the floor in claiming the same positions."
"But I am afraid that this political linkage with the upgrading of the participation of one of the ENP countries, and particularly the countries in the Mediterranean, has created a precedent and I do not know where it will lead."
"We have not listed political conditionality among bilateral relations issues within the ENP policies."
"In the case of Morocco, for instance, we have never mentioned the Western Sahara or human rights."
"The same applies in the case of Egypt or any country in the Mediterranean."
"I cannot understand why this time we have chosen this political link."
"Secondly, it is my view that the more you engage in dialogue, cooperation and trust - as Mr Jouyet has said - with any of the countries' partners, the more influence you have on them."
"We have shut a door today and I do not know how we are going to open it."
"Thirdly, I am sure that in our proceedings today, we have set a condition."
"We have said that it is just a deferral and we are going to come back to it."
"How are we going to come back to it?"
"When will the situation in the Gaza Strip be so satisfactory that we will decide to come back to it?"
"As Mrs Napoletano has said on the issue of the settlements, as with so many other issues on which we want to have a positive influence on Israel, when are we going to feel politically satisfied enough to bring back this fine resolution prepared in the Committee on Foreign Affairs?"
"Mr President, Europe cannot upgrade its relations with Israel until its government convincingly demonstrates a change of course."
"It must end the collective punishment of the Palestinian population by lifting the siege of Gaza and demonstrate its commitment to engage seriously with the Palestinian leadership to find a workable and sustainable two-state solution."
"We all want normal relations with Israel, but it is impossible in the current circumstances."
"I support without reservation Israel's right to defend itself, but such defence has to be within accepted international law and the responsibilities an occupying power takes upon itself when it invades another country."
"The state of Israel, which prides itself on its democratic system, has been found in breach of international law on so many occasions in the way it treats Palestinians that most people's patience has been stretched to breaking point."
"On a recent official visit to Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank, I saw for myself the serious deterioration in the conditions of daily life for ordinary Palestinians."
"Their economy has been crushed."
"There are 210 illegal settlements."
"Palestinian land and homes are constantly being seized."
"There are 11 000 Palestinian prisoners and 40 elected members of the Palestinian legislative council in detention."
"Over 300 young people under 18 years of age, some as young as 12 years old, are in detention."
"Gaza is under siege and threat of military invasion and already 50% of its population is dependent on food aid."
"The list goes on."
"This brutal collective punishment and land grabbing by Israel is a gross breach of international law and is destroying the possibility of peace."
"Consequently, now is not the time for this Parliament to assent to an upgrading of relations."
"In fact I believe it should be deferred until after the Israeli and Palestinian elections due early in 2009."
"In the meantime, every effort must be made by the international community to de-escalate the situation and to create the conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, the purpose of such agreements as the upgrading of Israel is to assure the participants in the conflict that they are involved in a reasonable process which guarantees their internal stability and gives them the assurance of future cooperation and existence."
"Today we have wasted this opportunity for giving such an assurance."
"We have wasted it and consequently, in my opinion, further fuelled the flames."
"I too am critical of Israel on many issues and particularly, for example, on the issue of settlement policy."
"However, when here today I hear that the key reason is the situation in the Gaza Strip, I am completely taken aback, especially as only half or even a quarter of the reasoning ever takes place."
"For we must see that if this reasoning is used, in three months another alibi will be found and then another in turn, to prevent the decision from being reached."
"For if I remember correctly, Israel left Gaza."
"If I remember correctly, Hamas overthrew the elected authorities of President Abbas and destroyed the government in a violent uprising, in breach of all rights."
"If I remember correctly, it is precisely the circumstances brought about by Hamas that are decisive for the situation in Gaza."
"If I remember correctly, shots are fired from Gaza at Israeli towns on a regular daily basis."
"And if this plays no role in such a debate and Israel is unilaterally blamed, this does not seem to me to be the way for European policy to gain trust in Jerusalem."
"For this reason, I think we have made a big mistake today."
"We will only be a force for peace in the region if we adhere completely to the truth and do not just simply make policies."
"I am convinced that this policy will not help President Abbas either but that it will further aid the radicalisation already so successful in Gaza."
"I therefore consider today's decision to be wrong."
"(PL) Mr President, a long-lasting conflict provides an opportunity to reflect on and analyse its causes and aggressive behaviours, and to seek solutions."
"I can understand the Palestinians' desperate rocket launchers, like rats driven into the corner of their cage, but I can also understand the Israelis' fear that their children might never come home from school again, since it is assumed that almost every Palestinian is a terrorist."
"It is not a matter of black and white."
"There are compromisers and stubborn extremists among the Palestinians, just as there are doves and hawks among the Israelis, as was made clear by Tzipi Livni."
"These internal divisions are of no small importance in the conflict, and the greater the role they play, the more powerful one of the parties to the conflict becomes."
"In my view, the Israelis are the more powerful because they have a state, to which they of course have an absolute right, and I support this."
"They therefore enjoy all the attributes of a state."
"This brings with it greater responsibility as well as a duty to take steps which may be risky but can give hope of a future peace."
"For this reason, Israel's demand of no rocket attacks by the Palestinians before the two-state project can go ahead is like saying that we would be prepared to have children provided that they all turn out to be intelligent and obtain doctorates or start profitable businesses."
"Unconventional situations call for the courage to make unconventional decisions, and I expect Israel to do just that."
"We, the European Union, must help them to reach those decisions."
"In other words: Road map for two states."
"As to strengthening the relationship between the EU and Israel, it seems to me that it is a good strategy, because it would give us greater influence and in the longer term would enable us to play a constructive part in mitigating this tragic conflict."
"I am in favour of strengthening our relationship."
"Mr President, as rapporteur of reports on the ENP, I have long supported Israel's increased involvement in EU programmes and agencies, which is mutually beneficial, given Israel's advanced status as a country in areas such as scientific and in particular environmental research."
"In recent weeks I have received many e-mails asking me to vote against this EU-Israel enhanced cooperation agreement."
"However, I believe that the EU and Israel are natural partners because they share the same values: democracy, the rule of law and personal freedom, and in particular a free press and independent judiciary."
"Not all the EU strategic partners can say the same."
"China, for example - dear to the President's heart I know - rejects those values, but strangely I do not receive many pleas to downgrade the EU's relationship with Beijing."
"That is because, sadly, the anti-Israel element amongst the public and in this House remains strong."
"When that sentiment is based on reasoning, I can respect it, even if I do not agree."
"Often though it is based on anti-Semitism and anti-Americanism, as the US is Israel's closest ally."
"Last week in India Jews were specifically sought out in Mumbai to be murdered by Jihadi terrorists."
"This demonstrates the need for the West to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with the Jewish State, as Israel is on the frontline of an existentialist battle with Islamist terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad, who have proved their determination to destroy Israel and our way of life."
"The European Parliament regrettably narrowly voted today not to give its opinion on this agreement - dear to the incoming Czech Presidency - which in my mind is disastrous and will send all the wrong signals to the Israeli public during a critical electoral period and will inevitably strengthen the hands of hardliners in Israel."
"It is not China that is dear to my heart, it is democracy and human rights in China, as in Israel and Palestine."
"Mr President, some would have us believe that this House today acted out of a crisis of conscience."
"I must say that I find that strange, considering how many times this House has endorsed agreements without a whimper in respect of countries which indeed have appalling human rights records and which indeed have governmental structures which are far from democratic."
"It seems to me that this House was blown off course today by an orchestrated campaign, from without and within, of very considerable venom against the State of Israel, and that we allowed ourselves to be unduly influenced by that."
"The blind bigotry that some have shown against Israel is quite appalling."
"Israel is a democracy in a region where democracies are few and far between."
"It accepts a two-state solution."
"It has been subjected to the most horrendous external and internal terrorism and, in consequence, it undoubtedly has the right to defend itself."
"Some in this House seem so concerned with their angst and hatred of Israel that they are eager to excuse terrorist attacks and, indeed, eager to excuse the excesses of Hamas in Gaza, seeing fault only within the state that is under attack."
"I think that is wrong."
"Mr President, those of us who have spoken in favour of deferring a decision on this matter have been accused a number of times in this debate of being anti-Semitic."
"That is totally inappropriate."
"Nobody on this side of the debate has accused anyone on the other side of bad faith or of having motives other than concern for the future of the people of Israel and the Palestinians."
"It would be in order for all of us here to recognise that we are concerned about people and that is why we take the position that we take."
"It is not based on any kind of anti-Semitic ideology."
"Mr De Rossa, the Chair fully recognises and indeed shares your position."
"(DE) Mr President, yes, there have been a number of e-mails but there has also been lobbying by the Israeli Embassy."
"That is not the reason why we have made any particular decision."
"The reason was our firm conviction that this vote would not have been appropriate at this time."
"Many arguments put forward by fellow Members - be it Mr Kasoulides, Mr Brok, Mr Zaleski or others - are thoroughly worthy arguments."
"I believe, after this difference of opinion that we had, it is now high time to return to a joint position that signifies support for Israel, but at the same time also support for the peace process, for the Palestinians' right to exist."
"That is what matters to us, nothing more or nothing less."
"Mr Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, it is not up to the Council to comment on procedural issues or on the decisions taken by this House in this field."
"I would say to Mr Swoboda that it is clear that the Council shares these objectives and agrees with what you said in your last speech, particularly with regard to stabilisation."
"The EU and the Council condemn all the violence, particularly the firing of rockets at the civilian population, which must stop."
"The fight against terrorism must continue tirelessly, and the fate of Corporal Shalit is a particular concern for the EU, and, if I may say so, especially for the French Presidency."
"That being said, the European Union continues to be deeply concerned by, and to condemn, the recent acceleration in the expansion of settlements."
"The continuing process of settlement, including natural expansion, must be stopped as a matter of urgency - including in East Jerusalem."
"It is contrary to international law, and it compromises the establishment of a viable Palestinian state; the barriers to movement into and within the occupied Palestinian territories must be lifted, in order to promote economic development."
"The humanitarian situation in Gaza must be improved as a matter of urgency, by pursuing the ceasefire, opening up the crossing points, and providing goods and services to help the population and to help the aid agencies, in particular the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), to do their work; and it is also important for Palestinian prisoners to be released in greater numbers, with priority being given to minors."
"We therefore share the same aims, as I am keen to stress to this House as clearly as possible."
"The problem is knowing how we can best apply pressure to reach the result you want: the creation of two States coexisting in security within the context of a stable peace process - a context in which the EU has an important place."
"We need to find out whether we will be able to be firm on the principles I have just outlined, and that Israel needs to respect, through dialogue and trust, or whether, indeed, it is through dialogue, as the Council believes and continues to believe having listened to this debate, that we will be able to maintain a wise balance."
"To conclude, I would remind you that the upgrading of relations needs to be seen within the more general context of the establishment of the Union for the Mediterranean and the development of a European neighbourhood policy."
"Do not forget that the proposed upgrading was preceded by a strengthening of our partnership with Morocco, which sent a powerful political message to our Arab neighbours on the southern shores of the Mediterranean;"
"I would also remind you that our negotiations with Israel have not neglected the Palestinian Authority, and that the European Union and the Palestinian Authority met in summer 2008 to set up new working groups to speed up the implementation of the action plan concluded in 2005."
"I would also reiterate that we as the Presidency are committed to making progress in all the areas, including politics, that remain an indispensable part of our relations with the State of Israel."
"It is this overall approach that gives meaning to the upgrading of the EU's relations with Israel, and it is this political dialogue that will make it possible, in our view, to ensure that the principles that various of you raised are better respected and defended and that the EU has a part to play in finding a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) I should like quite briefly to give you three things to consider at the end of this debate."
"Firstly, in a debate about our cooperation with Israel, in which human rights and the humanitarian problems of the Palestinians are rightly discussed, it should not, however, be forgotten that we have a particular responsibility towards Israel."
"Our policy towards Israel is determined not only by interests, it is determined by the fact that the mere existence of the State of Israel has something to do with European history and that a particular responsibility results from this."
"And a second consequence of this is that the partnership which we aim to have with Israel or which we have perhaps already achieved must be reliable."
"We demand reliability from our Israeli partners and Israel is entitled to demand reliability from us too."
"Cooperation on these projects and policies has been offered to Israel."
"It may interest you to know that there are good reasons why Israel was the first country - the very first country - to be offered an action plan within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"That was in 2003."
"I did it myself."
"The last thing I would like to say is that these programmes and policies about which we are speaking are not an end in themselves."
"They have a deeper political basis."
"This deep political basis is to show Israel that there is the prospect of long-term cooperation with Europe for Israel, a prospect which Israel needs for the time after the conflict."
"And Israel needs that in order to be able to end the conflict in the first place."
"The other thing is that however small these initiatives may be, there are a number of things in them which enable us to promote bilateral and trilateral projects."
"I myself was recently in Jordan, Israel and Palestine to talk about an initiative which would permit us to make a policy for small and medium-sized enterprises in a trilateral framework."
"We also have research projects which are bilateral."
"This means that we have a framework instrument here which permits us to go across borders and achieve precisely what we want: cooperation and normality in this crisis region."
"I shall refrain from drawing any conclusion about what I have just said."
"I only ask you to consider it in your subsequent decisions."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to respond first of all to you, Mr Verheugen."
"You said, quite rightly, that we have a particular responsibility towards Israel."
"We have taken on this responsibility collectively, and it is important."
"Moreover, it is precisely because we have this responsibility towards Israel that we have an at least equal responsibility with regard to the situation of Palestinians today, you must agree."
"Mr Jouyet, we share the same goals, and you have, with good cause, listed a whole series of important issues that must be solved in the long, medium or short term."
"You used a highly significant word when you said 'the situation in Gaza, as a matter of urgency...' You used the word 'urgency'."
"We have asked for a deferment."
"We are giving ourselves time to see whether this urgency is in fact taken into account."
"You believe - and you are perfectly entitled to your opinion - that raising the status of Israel will make it easier to negotiate with them."
"I only wish it were true, but I cannot see any evidence of it, and we have in any case been in negotiations for more than a year, since Annapolis."
"As you know, Parliament's resources are very few."
"We are using the means we have to send a friendly signal to Israel, saying, 'Please get a move on!' -."
"Unfortunately I did not hear the slightest indication from Mrs Tzipi Livni yesterday that this will happen."
"I am waiting and hoping."
"I would also like to thank you, Mrs Hybášková - you were not present when I began speaking - I would like to say to you that you have been an exemplary partner, faithful to your commitments, as we shall be to ours, and I will not allow those Members who have questioned the relevance of human rights as the grounds for today's decision to persuade us that they are right."
"That is unacceptable!"
"As for the anti-Semitic reproaches and other criticisms, which I have heard already today and which, I must warn you, we will hear more of - once again, this is unworthy of the European Parliament!"
"Why, in this European Parliament, should we be suspected of playing tactics when we speak of human rights?"
"If it is true that these rights are being breached, it is an urgent matter."
"I stand by the commitments we have made with our political partners regarding foreign affairs."
"In my view they are still valid, but I think that, realistically, the time is not right."
"We have made friendly gestures towards Israel."
"We will continue to do so, naturally."
"But our concern for the fate of the Palestinians remains alive and well."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"I have received a motion for a resolution to wind up the debate tabled under Rule 103(2)."
"The vote on the report by Mrs De Keyser and the vote on the motion for a resolution will take place during a subsequent part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (GA) - It would be a bad sign if the EU were to improve relations with Israel at present."
"It would show that the EU was willing to ignore major, continual and persistent violations of human rights and of international law."
"That would almost be like saying that the EU gives Israel the freedom to continue with repressive and illegal activities, with forced relocations of the population, with extrajudicial assassinations, with the occupation of Palestine and with an illegal Wall and settlements."
"We should put as much pressure as we can on Israel so that it will have to fulfil its promises under international law and under UN resolutions."
"Today, as MEPs from all over Europe, we must send a strong message to Israel to let them know that we have had enough."
"In 2002 the European Parliament voted to suspend the EU-Israel Association Agreement because of Israel's serious violations of human rights."
"Despite this, there is now talk of Israel taking part in an EU programme that deals with competitiveness and economic innovation, even though Israel is deliberately destroying the economy and infrastructure of Gaza."
"I welcome the decision to cancel the vote on the improvement of relations between the EU and Israel."
"in writing. - (EL) The Council proposal to give preferential treatment to and upgrade the already strong cooperation between the EU and Israel - irrespective of the fact that the European Parliament vote on it has been adjourned - is, whichever way you look at it, a challenge to Europeans and to all the nations of the world, an insult to the thousands of victims of Israeli barbarity."
"This proposal effectively perpetuates Israeli apartheid and rewards the mass infringements by Israel of international rules of law and the human rights of the Palestinian people, the occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Eastern Jerusalem and the continuing construction of the Wall of Shame and mass settlements and ignores UN resolutions condemning Israel and the resolution passed in 2002 by the European Parliament on the suspension of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Israel."
"Although Israel has maintained the same policy towards the Palestinian people for 60 years, and nations and the UN have condemned it, a provocative proposal has been tabled suggesting that we turn a blind eye to the blatant infringements of human rights by the Israeli occupying forces."
"This proves once again that, in its hypocrisy as regards respect for human rights, the EU is using double standards in its policy, depending on its interests in each particular case."
"in writing. - Approval of the proposed Neighbourhood Agreement with the State of Israel would incorporate Israel into certain Community programmes under the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), a policy designed to promote reform and stability in the European Union's neighbourhood."
"Designed to take effect immediately, this agreement would require Israel to make financial contributions to the European Union's budget in exchange for participation in certain Community programmes."
"This agreement will be subject to review every three years after its approval by both parties."
"Support for this Neighbourhood Agreement would build upon the existing Association Agreement and represent a step toward enhanced cooperation on trade and progress in bringing resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process."
"In the light of the recent visit to the European Parliament by the Israeli Foreign Minister, who advocated the strengthening of the Israel-EU relationship politically, and the current Action Plan just completed by the High Representative, the approval of this Neighbourhood Agreement would benefit both parties by improving each party's understanding of the other and hastening the arrival of peace and stability in the Middle East and Mediterranean."
"Steps towards improving the environment for SMEs in Europe - Small Business Act (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on steps towards improving the environment for SMEs in Europe - Small Business Act by Nicole Fontaine and Giles Chichester, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, and Edit Herczog, on behalf of the PSE Group - B6-0485/2008)."
"author. - Mr President, we all here in Parliament welcome the achievement of the last five years brought about by the Commission, especially Mr Verheugen, together with the European Parliament and with European enterprises: our achievement to change our approach to European enterprises, an achievement which has a name now - the Think Small First principle, laid down in the Small Business Act."
"We have to work on this act."
"The current economic crisis underscores the need to adopt the Small Business Act as soon as possible."
"The 23 million European enterprises and the two-thirds of European employees involved need an unambiguous message that the change in our legislative approach to Think Small First is a real basis for our future work and behaviour."
"The very first signal that we are doing that is the 'small SME' test."
"Therefore, because of the need for an unambiguous message, we are very sorry that the Council did not give a binding character to the provisions laid down in the Small Business Act."
"We really hope that in the European Council next week you will come back to this question and that the prime ministers of the Member States will give some binding character to this Small Business Act."
"However, we welcome the Council decision on the priority actions."
"We think it is very important to think small first in order to improve the access to finance; very important to think small first to simplify the regulatory environment; and very important to think small first to facilitate market access."
"We ask the Commission and the Council to act together."
"A more European answer is needed."
"Multi-country responses can be very effective but can result in divergence rather than the cohesion which we wish for under the European idea."
"Therefore it is critical that the Commission improve the procedures for yearly reporting by the Member States with the support of the Lisbon Scoreboard and I ask the Council if it is ready to do so."
"European citizens, entrepreneurs and employees need ideas, but they need more."
"They need innovation in our procedures, but it will not be enough."
"They need action, but even then it will not be enough."
"We need delivery based on our ideas, innovation and actions."
"Please go for it."
"The Parliament will support you on that."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Mr Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, our group enthusiastically supports the draft Small Business Act presented to us by the Commission last June."
"It is true, since the year 2000, initiatives have been launched for small and medium-sized enterprises - Mrs Vlasto's excellent work on the SME Charter comes to mind in particular - initiatives that have been welcomed but deemed insufficient, since all too often they remain no more than pious hopes."
"Today, we need to go further."
"The serious economic crisis being experienced in our countries, with particularly worrying consequences for SMEs, spurs us on where encouragement was needed."
"In this respect, the Small Business Act forms part of a new, determinedly pro-active approach."
"In a few weeks' time, we will examine Mrs Herczog's report on the Commission's communication, but today, by submitting this oral question, we have chosen to call on the Council."
"Mr Jouyet, we have noted with interest the conclusions adopted yesterday by the Competitiveness Council and we would like to know whether the European Council of 11 and 12 December will indeed relay these conclusions and push for the general guiding principle 'Think Small First' to be transposed quickly into Member States' legislation."
"We hope that the Council will proceed on the basis of the action plan that is attached to it, accompanied by practical measures."
"In this regard, and in the short time I have been allocated, I wish to emphasise three areas in which we need a strong lead."
"Firstly, systematic impact assessments and regular follow-up, monitored by the European Parliament, on the status of the Small Business Act in the Member States."
"Secondly, access to public contracts."
"The code of good conduct has no binding authority; together we need to be more imaginative, more inventive and to propose appropriate and practical measures that will genuinely open up these contracts to SMEs."
"Finally, access to funding, which in the current climate is more vital than ever."
"Your proposals are sound, Mr Jouyet, they should also incorporate support for the offer."
"There is no time to waste."
"Please assure us of the Council's intentions."
"Mr President, Mr McMillan, Mr Verheugen, honourable Members, as you have pointed out, ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council adopted conclusions on the Small Business Act for Europe, proposed by the Commission."
"This Small Business Act represents a strong political commitment towards the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As Mrs Fontaine highlighted, it is also an important response to the economic crisis we are currently experiencing."
"That is why, together with Hervé Novelli, who regrets that he cannot be with us, I am convinced, to reassure Mrs Fontaine and Mrs Herczog, that the European Council will express strong political support for the goals of this Small Business Act."
"As you have emphasised, the Small Business Act cannot solve all of the current economic problems, but it should ensure that essential steps are taken to tackle the financial crisis and the consequent economic slowdown."
"That is why, on Monday, we also adopted an action plan committing the Member States to implementing these urgent measures."
"This act is highly significant, and the French Presidency is particularly pleased with the very meaningful plan."
"Mrs Fontaine gave a good outline of the strong recommendations it contains."
"First and foremost, we need to look at the problem of SME financing."
"From this point of view, we must praise the efforts of the European Investment Bank, as it is to inject EUR 30 billion between 2008 and 2011."
"Beyond this, however, we must also make certain that the late payments directive is reviewed so as to relieve businesses' cash flow problems."
"The Small Business Act and the action plan propose to ensure that SMEs are paid within thirty days."
"I do not know whether we will achieve this objective, but I am convinced that this is the direction we should be taking."
"Reducing late payments means easing SME cash flow, at a time when one in four solvency cases in Europe are caused by excessive delays in payment."
"Boosting the venture capital market is another important factor, since this market, as you are aware, is too restricted in Europe compared with the United States."
"We have plans to establish a European venture capital mechanism as well as recognition of venture capital funds between Member States."
"Our other priority, as you have pointed out, ladies and gentlemen, is simplification."
"SMEs suffer even more than large businesses do from red tape and the various administrative tasks they are required to perform."
"It is for this reason that we must indeed implement and apply the Think Small First principle, which consists of considering the interests of SMEs in all Union legislation."
"We also hope to establish an SME test, and impact assessments, I can assure you, will be carried out and made public for every Community text that affects SMEs, and it would be desirable for the Member States to do the same."
"In addition, we are undertaking not to ask SMEs for the same information several times over - in other words, we will seek to do everything in one go."
"With regard to funding and simplification, there are more significant measures."
"SMEs must be able to benefit fully from the single market and in particular from the ability to export."
"That is why adopting the European company statute will also enable SMEs, by establishing their subsidiaries on the different European markets, to gain greater benefit from this market."
"To respond to the questions that have been asked, and in light of the request made by the Competitiveness Council to the European Council, the Council, at the highest level, and the Commission, have committed to monitoring this action plan closely, in particular within the context of the national reform programmes accompanying the Lisbon process."
"We are genuinely very pleased with the momentum that last Monday's action plan was able to give to this work."
"It is indeed the Council's belief that SME policy is one of the key areas in our common fight against the economic crisis and for the speedy recovery of the European Union's economy."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the start of the crisis - and we are at the start of a crisis - the question about the future of our small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe has become even more important."
"For we should recognise one thing quite clearly: the effects of this crisis will be greater for small and medium-sized enterprises than for large ones quite simply because smaller enterprises have no equity base that would permit them to ride out a longer lean period."
"This therefore means that it is crucial that the signal to small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe is strong and clear."
"Therefore, I am very grateful to Jean-Pierre Jouyet and the French Presidency for the generous support that they have given to the Small Business Act and I thank Mrs Herczog and Mrs Fontaine for taking the initiative to discuss this here today."
"This is important because the European Council is anticipated with great excitement in the coming week."
"The people of Europe will look to the Heads of State or Government in the next week and will expect an answer from them, an answer to the questions, 'How do we get through this crisis, how do we retain our prosperity, how do we retain our jobs, how do we retain our security?' 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe will also look to Brussels and await the reply from the Heads of State or Government."
"That is why I am so happy that Jean-Pierre Jouyet has just said that the support from the European Council will be strong and clear."
"And without doubt we both agree that this means that we will certainly find more than a few words on this topic in the conclusions."
"That makes me very happy."
"In truth this policy is also only just starting."
"The European Parliament has a very important role to play here."
"For here too it holds that words are one thing, actions are what counts."
"And in the first instance actions for small and medium-sized enterprises take place at national level, at regional level and even at local level."
"We must ensure that the principles which we enshrine in Europe are brought to life in the Member States and in all our regions."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are not supplicants but the core of our European economy."
"Only if we give them the framework conditions which they now need will they be able to perform their task within our European economy."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, given small businesses' importance in the economy for employment and job creation, enterprise and wealth creation, innovation, new products and new services, now is a very good time for us to do something to boost their efforts in difficult times."
"There is a tendency at EU level to wax enthusiastic about SMEs' potential and performance."
"Indeed it would be rather difficult to be negative."
"However, the thrust of this question and the motion for a resolution is that we must go beyond rhetoric and deliver concrete action."
"One of the priorities identified is the need for improved access to finance for SMEs."
"This is a perennial cry, for the problem is long-standing."
"Yet now in the financial crisis, when a seizure of credit is hitting all business, it must surely be worse for SMEs, which tend to be at the end of the food chain as far as orders and payments are concerned."
"So I strongly support the call for making finance and credit more available."
"The question is whether the banks will respond."
"Based upon my own experience of working in, and then running, a small business, it is very difficult to define forms of assistance and support that can help all SMEs, because they are so varied."
"I feel that the best sort of help is access to information and I believe that the Internet has made a huge change in that respect from my time in business."
"The next best thing is to be left alone to get on with the business."
"So, while I recognise that it is not possible to have no regulation, I also support the priority of better regulation, not least because that is something that legislators and governments can do."
"I support the call for action from both the Commission and the Member States."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, small-scale enterprises are central to my region."
"The West Midlands' industries will welcome the Think Small First principle."
"However, the current financial crisis has left many small businesses facing severe difficulties."
"As we have already heard, they are dealing with cash flow issues and unpaid debts and cannot access credit."
"The latest insolvency figures for my region point to 500 businesses going bust in the last three months."
"Therefore, I welcome the EIB funding."
"However, I do not believe that the proposals so far go far enough in relation to their binding nature - which could really help the SME sector."
"So my question to the Council is: how are you going to address this next week?"
"I have heard what the Competitiveness Council has said, but the important thing is that, unless the proposals have a binding character, it is not really going to help small businesses right now; it is not going to help them to access markets or to access finance."
"I believe I have heard it said for very many years that it is very important that the Council clarifies that it intends to cut administrative burdens."
"Small businesses face considerable costs."
"Where big companies spend EUR 1 for each employee, a small business can spend up to EUR 10 for each one."
"Finally, I would just add one point."
"Whilst it is very important to manage financial crises, more needs to be done for the SMEs right now, because they are the real economy."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are the DNA of our economy; they should be supported, while enhancing competitiveness and levels of employment in Europe."
"The Small Business Act is an initiative which today needs support from all political parties."
"This is an important contribution to European small and medium-sized enterprises in view of today's financial and economic crisis."
"Here we have a draft resolution which reflects concerns from the European Parliament and obligations to the Council."
"We must endeavour for the Small Business Act to be effectively implemented in all the Member States."
"This requires it to be included into the national action plans and legal documents, and that a monitoring system of this document be introduced in the Member States."
"We must take additional measures to ensure that the Small Business Act does not experience the sad fate of the European SME Charter."
"We have to understand that guidance documents often 'settle' on the shelves of national bureaucrats, and ultimately their desired purpose is not achieved:"
"Tax credits and incentives for start-ups, micro-credits, credit guarantees, venture capital, provision of free information and counselling, continuous enhancement of the entrepreneur's image and authority, etc."
"The ends will justify the means; however, it requires effort and courage."
"I have no doubt that the Community-wide implementation of the Small Business Act will help prevent economic and social decline in Europe, and alleviate the consequences of the financial crisis."
"(NL) First of all, I should like to pay tribute to the French Presidency for their haste in drawing the right conclusions from this Small Business Act, so that things can actually start moving."
"We in this Parliament have immediately responded to this by amending our procedure."
"After all, in this economic crisis, we really have to go all out for the SMEs in Europe as they are the Small Business Act's very raison d'être."
"We have to make far better use of the potential of entrepreneurs in Europe."
"I should particularly like to draw your attention today to female entrepreneurship, for it is a strange paradox."
"Women are a lot better at it."
"It is far less likely, or so the figures suggest, for women entrepreneurs to go bankrupt."
"Despite this, it is still much more difficult for women entrepreneurs to get their hands on credit in order to start a business."
"This needs to be made easier, as it is desperately needed."
"This means that women entrepreneurs need to be given better access to funding and existing funds."
"Micro-credit is also a very important means of improving the economic status and independence of women, not least for women from minority groups."
"In the current credit crunch, when banks are less inclined to grant credit, this has become far more difficult, and this is another reason why it is important for the guarantees of the European Investment Bank to be available, precisely for micro-credit and for women entrepreneurs."
"It is important for women to be able to start their own small businesses, so that they can juggle work and family effectively."
"This is also very important to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"I welcome the fact that the Council's conclusions already specifically mention female entrepreneurship."
"Keep up the good work, I would say."
"(RO) We are awaiting with interest the adoption of the European legal framework for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The EU economic recovery plan will open up new sources of funding for financing small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Reducing the administrative burden, financing professional training and creating the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund are measures which will help protect jobs and promote entrepreneurship."
"The European Investment Bank will make available EUR 30 billion to finance loans requested by SMEs."
"However, I feel that this amount is not sufficient."
"I think that at this time of crisis the following urgent measures need to be taken: procedures for granting state aid should be simplified; the period for founding a company should be limited to three days; and the settlement by public institutions of payments owing to SMEs should be guaranteed within a maximum period of 30 days."
"I welcome the proposal from the Commission to promote the use of electronic invoicing, an investment estimated at EUR 18 billion."
"It is also becoming necessary to develop competitive clusters based on companies investing in research and the development of new technologies."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Jouyet, Mr Verheugen, we all know that small and medium-sized enterprises form the backbone of the European Union, because they employ more than 70% of the EU workforce and represent 99% of European businesses."
"As we have already heard, these millions of SMEs are now worried and threatened by the financial crisis as it is eroding household purchasing power and confidence, and thus affecting the order books."
"It is therefore SMEs' cash flow that is in danger and so we must undertake to support their activities by making sure that the banks guarantee effective access to the necessary finance, so that SMEs can remain in business."
"This is the essence of the conclusions of the Competitiveness Council of 1 December, to which Mr Jouyet referred, and of the recovery plan adopted by European finance ministers."
"Making the needs of SMEs a permanent political priority for the Union is essential, and I welcome the action plan in support of the Small Business Act for Europe."
"It reflects the desire to ensure the application of the guiding principle of giving first priority to small businesses, namely to European SMEs."
"Nonetheless, as the Commissioner has said, and as we all agree, the Council needs to join the other European institutions so that this principle can be translated into reality; we must move beyond words and on to action, to implement it in all policies and all European programmes."
"We can say, however, that this action plan is a genuine response to the urgency of the situation."
"Mr Jouyet, may I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the French Presidency for its pro-activeness that has enabled intentions to be transformed swiftly into action."
"(ES) Mr President, I have asked to speak in order to congratulate the Commission on this initiative, which represents a major advance in cutting out red tape and other obstacles that European small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have to face on a daily basis."
"The plan emphasises the important role that SMEs play in Europe's economy."
"As has already been pointed out, we must not forget that roughly 23 million small and medium-sized businesses operate in the EU, generate 70% of the jobs and cover all sectors of activity."
"The action plan to reduce administrative burdens has set itself the target of cutting them by 25% by 2012."
"We cannot help the fact that current legislation generates some administrative burdens, with a cost estimated at 3.5% of Europe's GDP in 2006."
"This ambitious target is part of a broader business policy, which aims at facilitating access for our SMEs to other markets, improving the potential for growth and encouraging the spirit of enterprise."
"It is an excellent idea to help our SMEs develop their businesses beyond our own borders."
"In addition, a common procedure for setting up businesses in the EU will help them establish subsidiaries in other EU Member States and benefit from the opportunities offered by the single market."
"My final point is that the main problem for our SMEs today is finance."
"We therefore welcome the European Investment Bank's proposal to diversify SME support instruments, to simplify their use and to expand their scope."
"(FR) Mr Jouyet, when Nicole Fontaine was putting her question, the Council was already answering."
"That is rare enough to be worthy of note."
"In fact, 48 hours ago, the Competitiveness Council examined and supported the plan put forward by the Commission in July, while our Parliament is still considering it."
"That is an undeniable success for the Council under the French Presidency and I would like to thank you, Mr Jouyet, and pay tribute to the good work that you and your colleagues have done, in particular Mr Novelli."
"The Council's success is particularly notable because the Commission's plan meant that you had to add an action plan, taking the principles it contained and setting goals for the next 3, 5 and 10 years."
"I understand that, in practical terms, what we have to do now is to consider small and medium-sized enterprises first in every piece of legislation and in every measure."
"We will do this with the European private company, with the late payments directive, with, I hope, cuts in VAT rates, and so on."
"I would simply like to say, however, to conclude, that above all SMEs must not be ghettoised, in other words the SME regulations we introduce must not be so singular that they end up forming a handicap."
"I agree with what Mrs Vlasto just said."
"It is obvious that in the current situation, when these businesses are in such need of funding and obtaining finance is so difficult, we must not take measures on their behalf, for example accounting guarantee exemptions, that cut their credits and therefore prevent them from having the means to operate."
"It is for this reason that small and medium-sized enterprises are not sub-companies."
"They must be companies like any others, vital to the European economy."
"(FR) Mr President, to recognise the key role played by small and medium-sized enterprises and to support them wholeheartedly against the problems that can hamper their growth, that is the declared and ultimate aim of the Small Business Act."
"As you know, small businesses play an undeniably crucial role in the European economic landscape."
"This invaluable support for building enterprise, the spirit of enterprise in Europe, is sanctioned by the principle introduced by the Commission: Think Small First."
"Who can be opposed to this?"
"What does it mean? 99% of all businesses are now affected by this ambitious plan."
"The two most important things in any company do not appear in its balance sheet: its reputation and its people."
"Why have I chosen to quote Henry Ford?"
"To say that while we are going to make life easier for SMEs, employees remain at the heart of enterprise, that the Small Business Act must also be a chance to promote the place of employees in the way these businesses are managed."
"Indeed, the Small Business Act should be a breath of fresh air within these companies bringing better recognition of their position, better consideration of their aspirations and that under no circumstances must we allow a 'light' Small Business Act with regard to labour law."
"- (SK) At a time of a financial crisis, strong words are not enough and concrete action must follow."
"At this critical time, we have to provide small and medium-sized enterprises with access to financial resources so that they can carry out their innovative activities in order to increase their technological sophistication and with it their competitiveness."
"In this area, it is necessary to strengthen the micro-credit programme and the risk capital fund."
"It is necessary to create conditions for investment in the technical infrastructure for research, development and innovation, with interconnection to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"For this reason, I welcome the EUR 30 billion package for loans for small and medium-sized enterprises agreed by the ECOFIN Council."
"I am currently preparing a report on the regulation concerning the introduction of construction products to the market."
"I am working very intensively with small and medium-sized enterprises, and I believe that I will be able to prepare a very good piece of legislation for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"(PL) Small and medium-sized enterprises must comply with the law just like all businesses, even though as a rule they are not in a position to hire a legal adviser or highly skilled financial advisers."
"At the same time, small and medium-sized enterprises create the largest number of jobs."
"That is why it is so important to support this sector by simplifying the regulations applying to it, offering training and by other actions."
"At a time of crisis it is especially important to make credits easier to obtain."
"Perhaps the Solidarity Fund could help by guaranteeing such credits."
"I support the adoption of the European Charter for Small Enterprises and congratulate the French Presidency."
"(PT) Mr President, urgent support for micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises requires a substantial change in the policies which have been applied in order to create a favourable atmosphere, specifically by improving the purchasing power of the population and, above all, workers' pay."
"However, it is not enough to announce measures and the opening of lines of credit."
"This support must actually reach the micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises and not get swallowed up by bureaucracy."
"We must not be satisfied with just supporting a few medium-sized enterprises and forgetting about the micro- and small enterprises that play a vital role in economic activity and the employment of workers, whose rights must also be guaranteed throughout this process."
"Mr President, the title of this question speaks about improving the environment for SMEs."
"Could I suggest that, if the EU really wants to help, rather than indulging in predictable rhetoric, there is something meaningful and immediate which could be done."
"Why could we not initiate a 'regulation holiday' for SMEs during the current global crisis?"
"Compliance with tier upon tier of EU regulation is so demanding, so onerous and so expensive that it is stultifying EU output and prosperity."
"The cost is unbearable."
"It amounts to billions per annum."
"At a stroke, through a 'regulation holiday', we could save businesses billions per year and allow them to grow."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have a question for Commissioner Verheugen: is the Commission ready to prepare a legal basis for a budget line for the 2009 or 2010 budget?"
"The second question is: would it be possible to give priority to action plans which are now becoming ever more likely in view of the financial crisis, also because of the current need for support for small and medium-sized businesses because precisely now, as a result of the financial crisis, this Small Business Act has become particularly important?"
"Can you envisage us being able to start an immediate action programme in this area?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the various speakers who, during the course of this debate, on the one hand have lent their support to the Small Business Act and on the other hand have insisted on rigorous and compulsory monitoring."
"I am also keen to reassure those who have spoken of making sure that the financial aid is well targeted towards small and medium-sized enterprises: the European Investment Bank aid will indeed be earmarked."
"Rest assured that as far as the European Council is concerned, the ministers shall convey this message to the Heads of State or Government, and that we, as the Presidency, shall argue for the most stringent application possible."
"We shall do our utmost to ensure that the Small Business Act and its action plan enjoy the clearest possible political support at the highest level."
"As Mr Toubon has said, care must be taken to make sure that the specific measures and simplification methods do not result in a weakening of guarantees with respect to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I see this as important."
"Finally, a nod to Mrs Wortmann: I would like to say to her that I am particularly aware of the support we must give to women's enterprise;"
"I am reminded of it every evening, apart from this evening, because my wife also runs a small business."
"I am therefore very conscious of this and you can count on the Presidency and on myself to ensure that your words will be followed by action, without, of course, there being the slightest conflict of interests, I say that before you all."
"I would like to extend my warmest thanks to Mr Verheugen and to everyone at the Commission for all they have done - we have worked well together during this presidency for the good of small and medium-sized enterprises - to thank you for taking part in this debate, as well as Mrs Fontaine for the question she raised and to say once again that the European Parliament will be instrumental to this process and its follow-up."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the very broad consensus that has been shown in this debate, not only in relation to the objectives of our policy for small and medium-sized enterprises, but also in relation to the steps which we are taking to achieve them."
"I should like to quickly answer the questions that have been raised."
"Mr Chichester, the European Investment Bank has already given a positive response."
"EUR 15 billion was planned as credit volumes by 2011, now it is 30 billion, therefore the amount has already been doubled."
"Furthermore, SMEs naturally also have other financial instruments at their disposal within the European Union, in particular in connection with the Structural Fund."
"I also wish to point out that all major European projects are designed in such a way that small and medium-sized enterprises have privileged access to them."
"As far as the question of reducing costs is concerned, I am happy to be able to inform you that the Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens for European Enterprises is going according to plan."
"The next major step now also involves a proposal to introduce e-invoicing, as it is required here, which will in fact lead to a saving of up to EUR 18 billion per annum for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In the case of the proposal for a directive regarding the problem of late payment, the Late Payment Directive, work is far advanced, and this same Parliament will be able to deal with this proposal."
"Regarding Mr Rübig's last question: Which executive authority would turn it down if Parliament offers it money?"
"However, I fear that you are not offering us any money, you are offering a budget line in which there is a zero."
"If you are able to offer a budget line with a great amount of additional money, please do, but I do not see that happening."
"Therefore, I believe that at this time it makes more sense to optimise the programmes and projects which we have in such a way that they serve to finance the Small Business Act."
"This applies, in particular, to the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, for which I am responsible, but it also applies to the major Structural Fund, even to the Rural Development Programme and even to the Framework Programme on Research and Development."
"Overall, I see substantial opportunities for making use of these programmes to promote small and medium-sized enterprises within the European Union."
"To conclude the debate I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 December from 12 noon onwards."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Improving the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe and supporting the Charter for Small Enterprises is very significant in terms of developing entrepreneurship and the economy of the European Union."
"This is particularly so because small and medium-sized enterprises employ over half of the citizens of the European Union and account for 99% of enterprises in the Union as a whole."
"Unfortunately, however, I have many concerns relating to implementation of the Charter for Small Enterprises."
"In Poland, for example, there were promises of ambitious plans to lighten the administrative burden, simplify provisions and do away with redundant legislation."
"In fact, the situation in government offices has not changed."
"Entrepreneurs are still coming up against incompetent officials and unnecessary procedures."
"In addition, they continue to suffer from undue bureaucracy that significantly restricts entrepreneurial activity."
"To date, no public service Internet portals have been created."
"The idea of such portals is to facilitate the registration of firms, the submission of tax or customs declarations and use of collections of statistical data."
"All these activities could be done electronically."
"If we do not make our procedures more effective and do not reform government offices, we shall not succeed in fulfilling the commitments in the Charter for Small Enterprises."
"Consequently, we shall fail to provide proper support for SMEs."
"in writing. - (PL) Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are of key importance to the European economy, to its competitiveness and to employment levels."
"Providing over 100 million jobs, SMEs contribute to economic growth."
"In addition, they are the main source of regional development and innovation, and promote gender equality."
"The European Union's SMEs still have lower productivity and a slower growth rate than those in the US, where such enterprises increase the number of jobs by an average of 60% in the first seven years of their operation, by comparison with approximately 10-20% in Europe."
"The European Charter for Small Enterprises launched by the European Commission last June introduces for the first time a comprehensive SME policy framework, granting them equal conditions and striving to improve their legal and administrative environment in the EU."
"An urgent question arises within this context: does the Council intend to formally support the European Charter for Small Enterprises and will Member States make a binding commitment to its implementation?"
"It is of vital importance to establish what steps the Council proposes to take to provide SMEs with steady access to funding at this time of financial crisis."
"in writing. - (DE) The more than 23 million small and medium-sized companies are rightly described as the economic backbone of the European Union."
"Despite their significance, SMEs cannot yet take full advantage of the internal market and in particular face bureaucratic difficulties."
"The Small Business Act is an important step in making SMEs more competitive and giving them the opportunity to realise their potential."
"The success of the 'better law-making' principle is not the only decisive factor here."
"In small and medium-sized businesses, awareness of the opportunities of European integration must also be strengthened."
"The Exchange Programme for Entrepreneurs is a good approach in this connection."
"The financial measures in the Small Business Act are particularly important for the promotion of SMEs."
"In the light of the current difficult economic situation, it is a must that SMEs retain their employees."
"Simplifications in procurement, the combating of late payment or facilities for borrowing and setting up new companies are efficient instruments in this connection."
"Overall, the Small Business Act protects the mature European corporate structure and makes European SMEs fit for competition on international markets."
"Arms exports (Code of Conduct) (debate)"
"The next item is the Council statement on arms exports (Code of Conduct)."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (FR) Mr President, as you have said, we are running very late, and I would like to apologise to the Members for this."
"I shall introduce this debate but, unfortunately, I have other commitments and, given the unexpected nature of the delay, I am unable to withdraw from them."
"I shall therefore ask the General Secretariat of the Council to take my place during the debate and, obviously, to provide the Presidency with a very detailed report of its conclusions."
"I wish to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to the fact that the transformation of the Code of Conduct into a common position is an important objective for the French Presidency and that it is necessary to give a legal basis to the responsible approach adopted by the Member States with regard to arms exports and to increase the points of convergence between nations."
"Your resolution of 13 March demonstrates that you also share our point of view concerning this issue."
"Discussions have been resumed in recent weeks."
"We are doing everything we can to make progress on this issue before the end of the French Presidency."
"The adoption of a common position will constitute an instrument that will help make it possible to implement a responsible policy designed, in particular, to avoid such exports being used for the purposes of internal repression or international aggression and prevent them from fuelling regional instability."
"We are convinced that the Union's initiative, within the framework of the United Nations, of establishing an arms trade treaty will gain in credibility once our own system for the control of the transfer of armaments becomes legally binding, and we support this House's opinion emphasising the urgency of converting the Code of Conduct into a legally binding instrument."
"We also support your opinion concerning the need to establish effective control of arms brokerage operations."
"The Member States have agreed that the commitments relating to the exchange of information provided for in the Council position of 2003 should be implemented by means of the mechanism established within the framework of the Code of Conduct."
"Therefore, although certain Member States have not yet adopted the legislation necessary for the transposition of these commitments into national law, I can assure you that all the Member States possess regulations in this field."
"The task now is to update these regulations so that they are fully compliant with the Council's common position."
"The adoption of common regulations concerning the control of exports in the form of a common position will also enable the Member States to strengthen their own controls of arms brokerage operations."
"The illegal movement of arms is another problem that concerns us, and the EU's strategy on small arms and light weapons clearly indicates the need to act in order to stop or hinder the illicit flow of arms."
"This action was reinforced in Vienna on 6 December 2007 during the meeting of the 40 States participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement on export controls for conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies."
"The Presidency supports the idea of examining the possibility of extending these best practices to the destabilising movement of small arms and light weapons, in particular by sea."
"Despite the delay in adopting a common position, I should like to emphasise the fact that the Code of Conduct is a particularly effective instrument that has made a significant contribution to the harmonisation of the Member States' national policies in the field of arms export control and, to this end, I should also like to point out that harmonisation is facilitated by the user guide, which provides guidelines followed by the public officials who are responsible for this area."
"This guide is regularly updated and therefore makes a very great and practical contribution to the efforts to harmonise national policies in this area."
"To conclude, I should like to say that we are working together towards the construction of a responsible approach to arms exports, and I should like to thank the European Parliament for its assistance in this matter."
"It can count on the commitment of both the Council and the Presidency."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (IT) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately the terrorist incidents which have occurred since 2001, the most recent of which have taken place in India these last few days, and the various conflicts ongoing in many parts of the world make this arms trade topic particularly relevant to the present and future in the widest sense."
"It happens far too often that major intentions expressed in the form of declarations of principle subsequently fail to be backed up by concrete action."
"It is glaringly obvious to everyone that this is a delicate subject, involving major industrial and commercial processes."
"It is therefore understandable how difficult it is for all states, especially Member States to ratify a control and regulation system."
"However, the pressure of events and the knowledge that there is illegal arms trafficking going on both internally and externally make it an urgent priority to regulate this area in a legally effective manner."
"It will also give some real meaning to the directive being drafted on the transfer of defence-related products within the Community if the code of conduct is ratified quickly."
"I am sorry that the President-in-Office of the Council has left, although based on what he said everything seems to be in order."
"I will therefore leave out some other points which I had prepared."
"In actual fact, I do not feel that everything is absolutely fine."
"Therefore, I think that the commitment which the Minister has made here this evening, like so many other commitments undertaken by so many others in other circumstances, needs to be converted, as we approach the end of the French Presidency, into a far-reaching stimulus, especially next week, so that the code of conduct can at least be ratified by all Member States."
"It would be significant if France could achieve this, other than simply announcing it here in the Chamber, but then not even having concrete results to show for it."
"Mr Zappalà, Mr Jouyet has in fact had to leave."
"I would like to apologise on his behalf since the problem is that he has a train to catch."
"It is actually because this debate has overrun that he cannot be here now."
"We all know how conscientiously Mr Jouyet has performed his work throughout these six months, but it is in fact this House that is running late."
"You can rest assured that the Council officers who are here will pass on to the Presidency all the comments that you have made and that other Members will make."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, the resolution that we are debating today demonstrates that there is consensus in this Parliament on what the arms export policy of the Member States of the European Union should be."
"The six largest political groups are united in the defence of a single list of legally binding criteria for European arms exports: the eight criteria of the Code of Conduct."
"Everyone agrees to call on the French Presidency to resolve the impasse that has existed for three years and that only France can resolve."
"We heard Mr Jouyet say a little while ago that France is now in favour of a legally binding Code of Conduct."
"We heard yesterday in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, from the French Minister of Defence, that a recent proposal by his country to turn the Code of Conduct into a common position had been undermined by the lack of consensus in the Council."
"The Minister did not make reference to the fact that the French proposal was linked to the lifting of the arms embargo on China, and it was this that led to the rejection of the French proposal by several Member States."
"If this strategy is confirmed, it will represent a blemish on a security and defence agenda from the French Presidency that is otherwise distinguished by its Europeanist ambition and dynamism."
"In the face of growing European integration in the area of foreign policy, the policy of 'every man for himself' with regard to arms exports is increasingly unjustifiable."
"It is true that the Code of Conduct is already taken seriously in many capitals, but we must put an end to a situation in which the European countries that systematically use human rights, sustainable development and regional stability criteria to guide their exports are put at a disadvantage by their partners who apply these same criteria selectively."
"European presidencies come to an end, but the need remains for Europe to arm itself with common criteria for arms exports; the consensus within this Parliament in favour of a common position also remains."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this year we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"But even though this was a success at the time, we must now express our frustration and bitterness with the failure to make it a legally binding instrument."
"Three years have passed since the Council Working Group on Arms reached a technical agreement on a common position."
"How many more years does the European Council need to adopt it?"
"How can we, as the European Union, protect our own credibility when speaking against illegal arms trafficking, if we are not able to put our entire house in order?"
"We need a Code of Conduct to be legally binding if we want to avoid any easy intra-Community transfer of arms, which may tempt brokers to look for the weakest link in Europe."
"When we speak of arms exports, we should think at the same time of human lives at stake in unstable countries."
"We can easily be accused, instead of peacemaking, of fuelling local conflicts in vulnerable parts of the world."
"I welcome the French Defence Minister's declaration that France has withdrawn its reservation on the common position."
"Will the French Presidency be able to convince the other Member States which are still opposing it?"
"I can only hope so, and wish for the French Presidency to make the adoption of the common position in the next two weeks another of the great achievements of its term of office."
"Mr President, the truth is that I am indignant, because I would much rather have given an enthusiastic speech congratulating the French Presidency on having finally brought about something that we have spent nine presidencies hearing was necessary, which is the adoption of a common position on arms exports."
"I say that we have spent nine presidencies hearing the same thing because we have been promised that this work would be carried out ever since the Dutch Presidency in 2004."
"We know that, from the technical standpoint in COARM (Code of Conduct on Arms Exports), the work is done."
"What I would like to have heard today is that the decision has already been made for the Ministers to finally sign the document."
"I am therefore sad to hear that we have not yet reached that stage, and I am even sadder to learn that the reason for such a state of affairs is that this decision is being linked to another one that gives cause for concern: the lifting of the arms embargo on China."
"The two issues, as we have said many times, are separate and one has nothing at all to do with the other."
"It seems to me that making one conditional on the other does no favours for what we have been discussing, namely peace and the control of arms exports."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, weapons are for killing."
"The reason for the arms exports that we are discussing is to kill other people - opponents."
"This is always left out in this debate."
"For ten years there has been a debate about whether this Code of Conduct is legally binding."
"Like my fellow Members, I had hoped to finally hear today that yes, we have reached that point."
"However, we have evidently not reached that point yet."
"In the meantime, I have been informed that an opt-out is evidently included in the directive to simplify the transfer of defence-related products within the EU, so evidently the desire is to have loopholes in the legally binding nature of arms exports."
"That cannot be permitted."
"Dual-use goods must also be included."
"I wish to clearly emphasise once again that this is about the European Union supplying arms - the European Union has now become the world's greatest arms exporter - and if these arms are supplied, they will also be used at some stage."
"And when they are used, crocodile tears will be shed."
"We need this legally binding Code of Conduct at last."
"I hope that it will be possible before the end of the French Presidency of the Council."
"(LT) Ten years ago, the European Union agreed on a Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"Unfortunately, it is not being implemented."
"The Council, meeting behind closed doors, is unable to adopt a common position."
"It would be very important to know which countries are blocking it, while allowing themselves to make huge profits from people's blood and tears."
"In March, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on this issue."
"However, as we speak, weapons made in European Union countries flow by a growing illegal stream to conflict zones and fall into the hands of criminals."
"It is a paradox that those weapons also go to countries to which the EU provides enormous support for development."
"The presidency countries of the Council of Europe - France and maybe also the Czech Republic to complete it - must do everything possible to approve the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, to prevent the irresponsible transfer of EU arms to criminals."
"If this fails, the parties hindering it must be identified."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we marked the 10th anniversary of the EU code of conduct for arms exports, we noted, unfortunately, that no progress had been made with regard to rendering this voluntary code a legally binding instrument."
"For years, the European Parliament has been arguing in favour of translating this code of conduct into legislation that is binding upon the Member States, in light of the increasing internationalisation of the arms industry."
"The European Parliament is currently discussing a proposal for a directive with a view to creating an internal market for defence products."
"In the discussions on this topic, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament argued in favour of more transparency and of effective sanctions in the event of non-compliance with the obligations."
"In this connection, our group made another reference to the code of conduct, but due to the lack of a legal framework, we can currently do no more than call on the Member States to act in the spirit of the code of conduct."
"We need stricter rules for the export of arms components, the transfer of products via joint ventures and the re-export of European military goods to third countries."
"Last year alone, western countries sold arms to developing countries for an estimated USD 42 billion; half of which were European."
"This needs to change."
"The European Union should set a good example in this area in particular."
"Mr President, the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Code is both an opportunity to celebrate and a motivation to continue efforts to make it compulsory."
"However, the very fact that ten years after its adoption the Code is still voluntary indicates the complex web of economic, commercial and political interests we are up against."
"Therefore, in spite of our moral superiority in asking for the Code's application to be made obligatory, that is not enough."
"We need a thorough professional analysis of this body of interests to identify working ways to persuade the arms producers, exporters and politicians to change heart."
"Therefore, as I already said, simple appeals based only on morality, however vocal, will not suffice."
"To conclude the debate, I have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 December from 12 noon onwards."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"I am going to be very strict and cut speakers off after exactly one minute."
"There are 31 Members on the list, although many or, at least, some of them are not present."
"This is not a catch-the-eye procedure, but instead we have a list of speakers who have asked to make one-minute speeches."
"(RO) In November the European Commission presented its 2008 report on the Republic of Macedonia."
"This report emphasises the progress that has been made during the past year, but does not provide a specific date for initiating accession negotiations."
"I believe that the progress which has been made in the areas of the economy, administrative reform and judicial reform, along with the current situation in the Western Balkans, entitles the Republic of Macedonia to hope that a date will be set for initiating accession negotiations in 2009."
"This is subject to the parliament and government of the Republic of Macedonia undertaking more sustained and responsible efforts to create a climate of democracy in order to ensure transparent, democratic conditions for the local and presidential elections due to take place in March 2009."
"At the same time, I would like to call on the European Commission to bear in mind the progress that has been made by the Republic of Macedonia over the last few years, as well as the responsibilities assumed by the parliament and government of the Republic of Macedonia."
"It should also draw up an action plan for lifting the visa requirements for citizens from the Republic of Macedonia ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(BG) I would like to draw attention to the sanctioning of Bulgaria by the Directorate General for Enlargement on the withdrawal of accreditation for two agencies that have been entitled to resources from the pre-accession funds of the EU."
"The efforts applied by the Bulgarian Government must be considered as an unconditional acceptance of the conditions placed by the EU."
"The high level of synchronisation of legislature, changes to the law on public tenders, the Criminal Code, the new law on conflict of interests, personnel changes and the involvement of all national resources in the improvement of the scheme for management and monitoring of EU funds are a guarantee of the government's real commitment."
"The withdrawal of accreditation has hardly been the best measure that has been applied, even sounding as a warning towards the next EU enlargement."
"The obligation to comply with EU criteria must correspond to equal treatment for all countries as well as with cooperation in solving problems."
"The Bulgarian Government is conducting a firm policy in the fight against ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the authorities of the Tibetan Government in Exile have issued the memorandum, document and proposals for giving Tibet real autonomy, which they submitted to the Chinese authorities during negotiations."
"This is living proof, if it were ever needed, that the Chinese authorities have lied and continue to lie when they maintain that the real aim of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan authorities is to achieve independence."
"The Dalai Lama will be our guest tomorrow and will address this Parliament."
"Thirty-five colleagues will start from midnight, which is very soon, a 24-hour hunger strike, a fast in support of the Dalai Lama."
"His Holiness informed us today that he himself will take part in this fast."
"I believe at this point that this is the most tangible way in which the Presidency of the Parliament needs to support and conduct ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament does not abide by the principle of non-discrimination."
"The multilingualism of this House is not respected either."
"There have been instances of language discrimination during Parliamentary Committee and delegation meetings."
"Particularly distressing is the unannounced limited access to interpretation during hearings or voting when discussing verbal amendments."
"Until the Rules of Procedure forbid starting meetings unless all interpretation requirements have been met, these incidents will keep recurring."
"Moreover, the financial services do not provide information in the languages of the MEPs to whom the information is addressed."
"The financial impact of the resultant misunderstandings is borne by the MEP."
"Deliberate language discrimination also occurs in EuroNews."
"I would therefore like to suggest that EuroNews should only be cofinanced with contributions from states in whose languages it is broadcast ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to use this opportunity to make a denunciation and an appeal in the fight to defend production and employment with rights in the textiles and clothing sector."
"My denunciation is of the growing number of companies that are closing or relocating their factories, and the increasing unemployment and situations of brutally intensified exploitation of workers that characterise the liberalisation of this important sector."
"My appeal is for the European Parliament to schedule an urgent debate about the textiles and clothing sector in the various Member States."
"Specifically, this must cover the expiry of the common monitoring system between the European Union and China, which terminates on 31 December 2008, as well as assess how well the recommendations that the EP adopted nearly a year ago have been followed."
"(PL) Mr President, may I use the platform offered by the European Parliament to appeal for support for the initiative of Polish patriotic circles calling for 25 May, the day on which Captain Pilecki was shot, to be named European Day of Heroes in the struggle against totalitarianism."
"The British historian, Professor Michael Foot, regarded Captain Pilecki as one of the six bravest participants of the World War II resistance movement."
"Witold Pilecki, an officer in the Polish Army who took part in the September Campaign during the German occupation of Poland, organised a resistance movement in Auschwitz, having become a voluntary prisoner there."
"Having escaped from the Nazi camp, he fought in the Warsaw Uprising and in the Second Polish Corps in Italy, and, on his return to Communist Poland, was arrested by the Communist Security Services and put in prison, where he was tortured, condemned to death and shot on 25 May 1948."
"Captain Pilecki devoted his life to the fight against the criminal dictatorships of the 20th century."
"Mr President, last Monday during his visit to Belfast, President Pöttering enthused about the EU supporting what was euphemistically called a 'conflict transformation centre' at the site of the former Maze prison, where some of the most vile and vicious terrorists were properly incarcerated."
"That was also where ten convicted IRA terrorists committed suicide during their hunger strike."
"What the President perhaps did not appreciate is that, because of this history, Irish Republicans - who love to wallow in self-pity - are determined to effect their own transformation on any such centre and turn it into a shrine for some of the most evil terrorists known to this generation."
"Hence the folly of the EU falling into the trap of funding such an obscenity and the foolishness of the President ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) On Sunday, 30 November, an historic event took place in Romania as the left was defeated in the general elections, which used the single-member system for the first time."
"The Liberal Democrat Party won the largest number of seats in parliament and could, along with the other centre-right parties, the National Liberals and the UMDR ethnic Hungarian party, form a comfortable majority to support a government lead by a prime minister from the Liberal Democrat Party."
"Unfortunately, Romania's socialists have announced prematurely that they have won the elections."
"In fact, certain socialist leaders in the European Parliament and even heads of governments have been misled by this information."
"Therefore, it is obvious that the position of these leaders will change, bearing in mind the actual result of the elections in Romania."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Delegation for relations with India, may I firstly give my sincere condolences to the families and friends of all those who were killed in last week's horrific terrorist atrocities in Mumbai and wish all those injured a speedy recovery."
"My sympathy also to colleagues and officials of the European Parliament caught up in these horrific and outrageous attacks."
"I have written to the Indian Prime Minister and the Chief Minister of Maharashtra to express our sympathy."
"Coordinated attacks such as these are designed to spread fear and mistrust amongst citizens and to test democracy's commitment to deeply held values."
"As such they require a robust response from all those who cherish democracy and international law."
"Therefore I welcome President Pöttering's strong statements in support of India."
"As a Parliament we need now to move away from words and provide concrete actions that can support India's needs."
"- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that at the moment we should be more aware of the fact that, when talking about Tibet and the Dalai Lama, we are actually talking mainly about ourselves."
"A few days ago, the simple announcement was made that President Sarkozy was boldly intending to meet the Dalai Lama in Poland."
"We have, however, been dealt with without even being listened to, dismissed, given no opportunity for a meeting."
"The wider European community is being allowed to welcome, speak to, receive and listen to the Dalai Lama."
"Why is this the case, Mr President?"
"I believe that the answer to this is quite clear."
"We know that 80% of Europeans, if they were consulted as a single people, would give their support to the Dalai Lama ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Mr President, in 1009, a thousand years ago, King St Stephen of Hungary established the diocese of Gyulafehérvár in Transylvania."
"This major event in church history is symbolic of the fact that Hungary, having converted to Christianity, became a member of the Europe of its day."
"In the 16th and 17th centuries, Gyulafehérvár was the capital of the independent principality of Transylvania, and the region became a symbol of tolerance and religious freedom."
"In 1918, the Romanian National Assembly held in Gyulafehérvár proclaimed the right of the Hungarian minority of Transylvania to self-government following the annexation of Transylvania to Romania."
"Romania is still under obligation to Europe by virtue of this decision."
"In the spirit of Gyulafehérvár, I recommend that the millennium of the archdiocese ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) On 27 December, we will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Wielkopolska Uprising."
"Thanks to the victory of this uprising, the old Polish province of Wielkopolska or Greater Poland became part of the newly emergent Poland."
"The success was paid for dearly."
"It cost the blood of over 2 000 dead and 20 000 wounded."
"We honour their memory."
"(PT) Increasing numbers of incidences of blackmail of workers - in which conditions are imposed on them that lead them to lose rights they have acquired - are beginning to arise under the pretext of the crisis of capitalism."
"Significant examples are those involving the Peugeot/Citroen Production Centre in Mangualde and the Renault Industrial Unit in Cacia, Aveiro; both of these are part of the Portuguese automobile industry."
"In both cases significant financial aid aimed at protecting jobs was granted by both the government and the EU, with the condition of creating more positions."
"However, the management of Peugeot/Citroen in Mangualde currently wishes to destroy rights that were fought for and are enshrined in the labour laws by pressuring the workers to accept harmful conditions that endanger their lives."
"At the Renault Industrial Unit in Cacia, the management decided to reduce production this year and prepare itself for not renewing fixed-term contracts, despite having committed itself to expansion ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(BG) This 27 November marked 89 years since Bulgaria was degraded with the signing of the Treaty of Neuilly, which dismembered territories from our motherland that to this day are populated with people with a Bulgarian self-conscience."
"These territories, which lie within the borders of the present-day countries of Serbia and Macedonia, should be returned to the jurisdiction of Bulgaria because these countries cannot be considered as successors to the Serbo-Croato-Slovenian state."
"Serbia was not recognised as the successor state to Yugoslavia by the UN and by the international community, while the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has not even been recognised by its constitutional name."
"We, patriots of Ataka, insist that the issue of the return of the Western Territories be settled before commencing EU membership negotiations with Serbia, while the accession of Macedonia into the EU must occur only after settlement of the issue of the return of the Strumica region into the realms of the Bulgarian state."
"(SL) I would like to say a word about the planned Commission measures, which I read about in the media, and which some constituents have also pointed out to me."
"These measures would supposedly provide financing for citizens to buy new cars."
"Such a measure would in fact promote consumerism; it would provide direct help for the car industry and would run counter to our environmental policies."
"I am also concerned about who will be responsible for the dismantling and recycling of these cars."
"I therefore call on the Commission to begin, as it has in the past, by promoting the development and production of clean vehicles, with replacements being introduced gradually on the basis of environmental criteria, while at the same time providing clear information to citizens about how the plan to revive the economy conforms to our environmental and climate policies."
"Mr President, the reason I wanted to make a one minute speech tonight is because I am concerned that, in Ireland, Ryanair are about to make a bid for the national airline, Aer Lingus."
"The bid, if successful, would create a private monopoly of airlines in the Irish market."
"The Commission rejected this proposal on a previous occasion and I would urge Commissioner Neelie Kroes to reject this bid again."
"In my view, it is a predatory bid and it would not be good for Ireland's economy to have this airline in the hands of Ryanair, who have no loyalty whatsoever to the Irish economy."
"(PL) Mr President, may I draw Parliament's attention to an extraordinary event which took place last July in Brody in Ukraine."
"A monument commemorating the soldiers of the murderous Waffen SS Galizien Division was unveiled there."
"I regard this as unbelievably scandalous that in the 21st century, at a time of reconciliation between nations, a group of people with openly nationalist and fascist sympathies can glorify a murderous unit responsible for the deaths of millions of Europeans, including my own countrymen, who perished in 1943-1945 as part of the planned genocide in Western Ukraine."
"I have no doubt that most Ukrainians share my concern about this matter."
"I also feel that the Ukrainian authorities cannot remain indifferent to this scandalous attempt to rewrite history."
"I also appeal to Parliament and EU institutions ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) On 10 December, the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will be commemorated all over the world."
"His Holiness the Dalai Lama will pay a visit to our Parliament tomorrow."
"China is one of the countries that have signed the Declaration, yet violate the human rights of men, women and children."
"As the Chairwoman of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I want to remind you of the one-child policy, which provides clear evidence of the totalitarian and undemocratic nature of the regime in China."
"This policy clearly violates a number of human rights."
"Let me mention just a few of them: the killing of girls who are unwanted in the context of sex selection, trafficking in human beings and sexual slavery, stealing of children, denial of the legal existence of children from second and further pregnancies, abandoned children, violence against pregnant women, forced abortions, post-abortion problems, and women's suicides."
"The democratic world should clearly express its reservations about China's policy and monitor ..."
"(RO) In Romania the left has won the elections because it received the largest number of votes and the largest percentage in Sunday's elections."
"This is a fact that cannot be ignored or distorted."
"3 December is International Day of People with Disabilities."
"One in four families has a person with disabilities among its family members."
"Against the backdrop of this economic and financial crisis, we are hearing almost every day of thousands of redundancies in Member States."
"In this difficult climate, the situation for disabled persons is getting worse."
"How will disabled people be able to find a job which will allow them a decent living from a salary, when thousands of other people without any disability are losing their jobs?"
"I call on the Commission to urgently adopt specific measures aimed at supporting people with disabilities."
"Particular attention needs to be focused on rare conditions which lead to physical or mental incapacity."
"I hope that in 2009, the year of innovation, we will invest more in research aimed at identifying ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, all EU countries need to have in place legislation which criminalises the practice of female genital mutilation."
"Measures also need to be put in place to address the needs of women and girls from new migrant communities who are at risk of FGM."
"I welcome Ireland's recent commitment as one of the 15 EU Member States to launch a national action plan on FGM."
"It is estimated that more than 2500 women living in Ireland have undergone FGM in other countries."
"The Irish plan highlights the risks FGM poses to women and girls and sets out policy goals to address its detrimental effects."
"Figures also reveal that, out of 9624 women now residing in Ireland who originally came from countries that practice FGM, 26.9% have undergone a form of female genital mutilation."
"The enactment of a law to place an outright ban on FGM is critical to the elimination of this."
"(HU) True dialogue between cultures and peoples exists when all are free to use their mother tongue and exercise their individual or collective rights."
"Today and tomorrow the European Parliament is expressing solidarity with the Tibetan people."
"More than 500 people have joined the silent demonstration on behalf of the freedom of Tibetans to use their mother tongue, practise their religion and enjoy true autonomy."
"Within the EU there are traditional ethnic minorities which are unable to study or use their mother tongue freely, and which lack cultural or territorial autonomy."
"What is more, there are countries which have reintroduced the notion of collective guilt, reminiscent of the Second World War, or countries which still want to rely on the Communist laws of the 1940s to guarantee the rights of traditional ethnic minorities."
"The EU's action on behalf of the minorities living on Chinese territory can be effective if ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) We are living in a period of great opportunities, as well as threats."
"Man can destroy much faster than build."
"The terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India, which claimed the lives of two hundred innocent civilians showed us again that the human ability to destroy knows no limits."
"Terrorism is a new war without borders and without fronts so the fear of nuclear and biological weapons is not without foundation."
"Europe is a model of coexistence of people from different cultures and religions."
"Its Christian heritage gives Europe the responsibility for world peace and a chance to become a source of hope for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect."
"Therefore, Benedict's Europe in a Crisis of Cultures is a set of recommendations offered to Europe by Pope Benedict XVI in his book."
"I believe that Europe will not ignore, but fulfil these recommendations."
"Mr President, the recycling sector in the European Union has a turnover of EUR 24 billion and employs about 500 000 people."
"It is made up of 60 000 companies and the EU has around 50% of the world's share of the waste and recycling industries."
"However, this sector is now in crisis as a result of the collapse in the price of recycled materials on world markets, and it is becoming economically unviable for waste businesses to continue to operate."
"Given the importance of this sector for sustainable consumption and production in the EU, I would like to urge the Commission to implement without delay the recommendations set out in the report by its own Taskforce on Recycling, which was compiled during the preparation of the communication entitled 'A lead market initiative for Europe'."
"That concludes this item."
"Facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries - C6-0280/2008 -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, the food facility began as a proposal from the Commission, in the light of the rising food prices that provoked riots in some countries, to use EUR 1 billion in leftover agricultural subsidy money to relieve the situation in developing countries through agricultural inputs and emergency safety nets."
"The money was, in this form, expected to be wholly additional to existing development funds."
"Now, five months later, we have our billion, but it is in an entirely different form than that originally envisaged."
"Two Fridays ago, I attended the budget conciliation meeting, with my colleagues from the Committee on Budgets and the Council, where we were finally able to reach a compromise over the funding of the food facility regulation."
"The last sticking points were then ironed out on the following Monday at a trialogue between Parliament, Commission and Council."
"The final compromise funding looks like this: EUR 1 billion to be financed over a period of three years, 2008-2010, via the flexibility instrument accounting for EUR 420 million; redeployment, with Heading 4, 'External actions', giving another EUR 240 million; and the increase of the emergency aid reserve by EUR 240 million for 2008."
"This increase requires a revision of the interinstitutional agreement."
"This amount is additional to another EUR 100 million used from the existing emergency aid reserve."
"As the emergency aid reserve is made up of contributions by the Member States, the top-up of funding will only be additional if the Member States do not compensate for their contributions by a corresponding reduction of the national budgets."
"It has been suggested that there are noises of dissatisfaction from the Committee on Foreign Affairs and others about the part-financing of this from the Stability Fund."
"The Foreign Affairs Committee may be unhappy about this but it was probably about the best deal that could be done in the circumstances."
"Although I support the compromise we have now reached, I have made a point of mentioning the shortcomings of the process and the outcome, both in the interests of honesty and to highlight - as I have done on previous occasions - the ludicrous situation where governments across the globe are producing multiple billions of dollars to bail out banks but have to search their souls to find, between 27 Member States and the budget of this Union, EUR 1 billion for the poorest people in the world."
"I think we have done the best we could have done in a hundred days."
"We have found the money and we have put the regulation together, but it is not a totally additional billion."
"The content of this report includes the fact that the compromise text has already been accepted by all Member States in COREPER, and that essential elements from my report and the amendments from my colleagues on the Committee on Development are in it."
"The regulation is limited in time."
"It now runs until the end of 2010."
"It concentrates on tackling the short-term crisis; its objectives are to boost agricultural production."
"It opposes the dispersion of funds by confining its use to a limited list of high-priority countries."
"It also widens the scope of possible implementing organisations and ensures parliamentary accountability."
"There are two statements appended to the regulation which help to ensure its proper implementation."
"At the end of the day, I think we have done the best we can between Council, Parliament and Commission."
"We have done it in a hundred days."
"We have brought the law before Parliament."
"We will vote on it tomorrow."
"It is already agreed."
"We have found the money."
"I would like, in that context, to pay tribute to the cooperation we received from the Council and the Commission, particularly from Commissioner Michel, who really did want this money to be additional."
"I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Development Committee, particularly Guido Van Hecken and Anne McLauchlan and to thank, in my office, Eoin Ó Seanáin and Oliver O'Callaghan, who were very helpful in all of this."
"I think at the end of the day that it is a good day's work and the best we could have done."
"Thank you, Mr Mitchell, and congratulations on your report and on a really important and admirable topic, which will enhance the European Parliament's reputation in the world as a factor for progress and solidarity."
"Commissioner Michel now has the floor."
"Like Mrs Oviir, Mrs Goudin and myself, he has just come back from the other side of the world, 14 000 km away, and he is going to tell us, on behalf of the Commission, about the meeting we had during the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"I can see you are on good form today, Commissioner."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Mitchell, ladies and gentlemen, the food crisis has had a severe impact on developing countries."
"I think that, as you have said and as you have shown by your actions, Europe had a moral obligation to respond rapidly, and this is all the more true since this crisis has been accompanied by a very serious financial and economic crisis whose disastrous effects on developing countries we will soon, unfortunately, be able to calculate, because these could very well involve the cancellation of public development aid, at the very least."
"However, we shall have an opportunity to return to this subject."
"It seems to me that our three institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - have succeeded in meeting the challenge by working swiftly on this facility intended to enable a rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries."
"I should like to thank you on behalf of President Barroso and the Commission."
"My special thanks also go to the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell, for his outstanding work, as well as to Mr Böge and Mr Le Foll for the contributions they have made on behalf of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, respectively."
"As you know, we regret the refusal to make use of the available margins under heading 2."
"However, we remained realistic given the prospects for an agreement on a good text."
"I have to say that the compromise text on which you will vote tomorrow is a good one: on the one hand, because it properly includes your amendments and those made by the Council and, on the other, because it retains the three key elements of our position."
"Firstly, a response of EUR 1 billion, and no one seems to have cast any serious doubt on our estimation of the requirements."
"Secondly, it has always been understood that this should be concentrated over a very short period of time."
"We proposed a period of two years but could accept three."
"Finally, the objective was to revive agricultural production in the countries most affected by the increase in prices."
"In other words, it was to save crops in the immediate future."
"What are the next steps after you vote tomorrow and after the Council's decision of 16 December?"
"I think that the most important thing will be implementation in practice."
"In January 2009, the Commission will propose the initial project funding decisions, because I believe that we clearly need to get things under way very quickly."
"The main aim is to save the agricultural production of the 2009 harvest."
"We shall therefore do everything possible to ensure that the majority of the financial commitments are realised in 2009 and have an effect on agricultural inputs, for example, for the 2009 season."
"As agreed, the general plan for implementation of the facility will be submitted to you in the very near future and, in any case, by the end of April 2009."
"This facility came about thanks to the political will of our three institutions, and its rapid, effective implementation will clearly require this same shared will."
"Mr President, the Committee on Budgets was aware of the European Union's moral responsibility to countries that are in difficulty."
"However, you need not regret for a moment, Commissioner, that we were unable to find the money for this noble purpose in Chapter 2."
"There is no point regretting this, because we have the same moral responsibilities to European farmers, whom we have been telling for months that there is no money for this, that and the other thing, and that the farmers in the new Member States will have to wait 10 years until they receive equal treatment."
"The funds had to be found elsewhere, in the appropriate place, and as the rapporteur has stated, we have indeed succeeded in doing so."
"I think that we have done a good job and we can be proud of it."
"The Committee on Budgets faced yet another problem."
"We were not convinced that - as the Commissioner has also stated - the Commission responded quickly, and that the European Commission's proposal is expedient in every respect."
"We found it regrettable that the concept of microcredit was not mentioned in the original material."
"The Committee on Budgets considers that it is very difficult to determine in Brussels or at the headquarters of any other international institution how one or another region or farmer that is facing difficulties can find a way out of their situation."
"The microcredit system has proven to be very successful and has helped many countries in difficulty, and we are very grateful that the Committee on Development has accepted the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets in this regard."
"Commissioner, I cannot guarantee, but can predict that in all likelihood the result of the vote tomorrow will meet with your satisfaction and that of all concerned parties. Thank you for your respectful attention."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FR) Mr President, I shall be brief."
"First of all, I should like to thank Mr Mitchell and to commend his work."
"I should also like to thank the Commissioner for his commitment and say that the food crisis will not simply be dealt with in two or three years but will remain a concern during the years to come."
"I should like to add one point in my role as representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"It is that, for fifteen years, the proportion of development aid devoted to agriculture has been consistently falling."
"As Mr Diouf has said, it has dropped from 15 to 4%."
"It is time to consider the idea that development also means supporting agriculture and, if this facility is to have meaning in the future, then this is the meaning that I personally intend to give it."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mitchell for his report."
"I welcome the creation of this food facility for the world's poorest farmers which has finally been agreed after long negotiations."
"Some members of the Council were not willing to provide unspent agricultural money to support developing countries."
"While one sixth of the world's population is now going hungry, certain Member States of the European Council held back (though a majority of members were in favour of using the CAP), citing a fear of setting precedents as their tenuous justification."
"The money has been found elsewhere, being phased over three years from 2008 to 2010 instead of over a two-year period."
"Sadly this money was most needed a few months ago when food prices were soaring."
"Food prices are no longer soaring in some of those same countries."
"Since food prices began to increase, the number of people going hungry has risen to nearly one billion. This year 100 million people were driven into poverty as a result of the food and fuel crisis, and that number continues to grow."
"People in developing countries spend up to 80% of their income on food, underlining the reason why the price of food must remain accessible."
"The food facility will contribute to solving some short-term needs by providing agriculture inputs and strengthening safety nets."
"However, a new food crisis will be imminent unless EU Member States and other rich countries address the structural problems that fuelled the food crisis."
"Congratulations, Commissioner."
"Without your total dedication to this cause, it would not have come to this apparently happy ending."
"You have fought hard all the time to achieve this aim."
"My thanks are also due to my colleague the rapporteur, Mr Mitchell."
"Between the two of you, you have saved the European Union from the resounding ridicule that would have resulted if we had not managed to find this billion, after having promised it so often in so many places around the world."
"Maybe it is not exactly a billion and it will not be entirely additional, although a very large part of it will be."
"It will not come from agriculture, as you had proposed, Commissioner, and it will not all come in just one year, but in two or three."
"The imperfections of the real world, however, did not stop you from achieving the goal that you had set yourself, with, may I say, the help of the Committee on Development and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"It is not a lot of money: just EUR 1 for each malnourished person in the world, EUR 1 per hungry individual."
"It may, however, help to reduce the number of them in the future, provided that the Member States do not deduct the additional funds that they have had to provide for this emergency relief from their development aid."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I call on all the Member States not to reduce the additional amount provided in this sum by cutting back in their national budgets."
"One Member State has already hinted that it may do so."
"Others like Spain, on the other hand, have made a firm commitment not to do so."
"There is no point at all in robbing Peter to pay Paul, in other words just moving money around so you end up giving the same amount."
"I am sure that you, Commissioner, will be the first to complain if that happens."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mitchell for his excellent report."
"My group has always been in favour of the rapid granting of food aid."
"The Commission made its proposal for aid worth EUR one billion in July."
"Unfortunately, that went against the principles of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline."
"This was surprising, as the Commission is traditionally a guardian of the Treaty and lawfulness."
"It was not until the budgetary conciliation stage that the Commission altered its proposal to conform to existing legislation."
"It was then that agreement was reached."
"The French Presidency also deserves our gratitude."
"It succeeded in persuading the Member States to adopt the food aid position."
"EUR 760 million out of EUR 1 billion is new money and a clear victory for the European Parliament."
"One problem is ensuring that the aid gets to its intended destination."
"Sceptics claim that just a part of the aid arrives at its destination, while most stays in the hands of intermediaries."
"This problem needs to be watched closely."
"One problem with agriculture in the developing countries is not the availability of fertilisers or seed but the lack of education and the primitive working methods, equipment and facilities."
"That will not be solved in one year with a billion euros."
"That is why food aid is primarily a wake-up call that development cooperation should make agricultural development and boosting food production its priority."
"Agriculture in developing countries is often practised in difficult conditions, typically barren spoil and a harsh climate."
"Such circumstances call for an exceptionally high degree of professional know-how and advanced farming methods."
"For that reason, vocational training needs to be developed."
"At present there is barely any at all."
"Production methods need to be adapted to the limits that poverty imposes."
"The leap from plough to hi-tech tractor is not at all an appropriate one."
"Agricultural development needs to happen one step at a time."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, now that my fellow Members have reminded us of the somewhat difficult progress of this excellent initiative, we hope that it will start to take a more concrete form."
"For my part, Commissioner, I should like to question you on two points."
"Firstly, it is said that some of the finance for the additional funds will be provided by drawing on the funds dedicated to the stability instrument, which was set up for the purposes of conflict prevention and the consolidation of peace."
"This redeployment appears to me to be extremely problematic."
"Has it been confirmed?"
"And if it has, will any compensation be envisaged?"
"I imagine that you will no doubt also be concerned with the long-term future of this instrument of instability."
"Secondly, now that this EUR 1 billion seems to have been raised, what channels will be employed to ensure that the funds are moved quickly and effectively to the many different and widely spread actors in the field, as well as to the hundreds of family-based agricultural organisations?"
"How do you intend to deal directly with these actors in the field and avoid the waste and loss which, as we well know, are associated with the presence of many different intermediaries?"
"on behalf of UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union is attempting to establish a facility which will enable it to offer rapid assistance to poor and non-developing countries, to ensure that their populations survive if food prices rise."
"In this context, we have been saying that the food shortages in those countries are permanent, and not simply associated with failed harvests or speculative food price rises."
"It follows therefore that short-term responses and food aid will not solve the problem."
"Offering training and introducing new production methods, better seed and fertiliser, promoted for years by FAO and the World Bank, have not brought the expected results."
"For this reason, regarding EUR 1 billion as a facility which will allow rapid response to food price surges in developing countries is not commensurate with the expected results, especially considering the way our Union operates."
"This was perfectly well noted and understood by Mr Mitchell, the rapporteur, but it would seem not to have been grasped by the rapporteurs for the consultative committees and the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The global food crisis and soaring prices are the result of food becoming a common commodity, an object of capitalist speculation rather than a means of survival."
"The European Union, by giving minimum funds and dedicating a fraction of its time wants pharisaically to wash its hands of its responsibilities on, what has officially been described as a crime against humanity."
"We believe that these funds will end up in the pockets of the multinational companies in control of the development programmes."
"The solution to this problem demands respect for the right to food security and sufficiency, supporting small- and medium-sized farmers and restructuring local and regional markets."
"In essence, we need a fundamental change in the common agricultural policy which currently promotes the transferral of the land over to the few, the uncontrolled exploitation of natural resources and the replacement of food crops with other plants."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, poverty, misery and starvation are the daily lot for the more than two billion members of the earth's population who live on less than two dollars a day."
"The recent dramatic price increases, particularly for rice, maize and other staples, are of course another major reason why many people do not have enough food."
"The EU has also noticed this problem and consequently wishes to set up a fund to deal with the crisis."
"The question that we must ask ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, is why we accept the EU's damaging agricultural policy, which is one of the worst culprits in this regard."
"This protectionist policy robs poor people of income opportunities and thus of the ability to avoid starvation."
"Nonetheless, this Chamber always votes in favour of the common agricultural policy."
"It is a tragedy, and I ask myself whether it is a conscious or an unconscious move on the part of the EU."
"(PL) We are all aware that due to the continuing food crisis many people, especially those living in the very poorest developing countries, are experiencing great difficulties."
"Instead of achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals, further millions are falling into poverty."
"The European Union must not hold back from coming to their aid."
"I expect that most of us sitting in this room would agree with this."
"Supporting these countries is our moral duty, an expression of solidarity with poorer nations."
"We must show them the right way to overcome the crisis and help them to provide the appropriate quantity of food, above all by supporting their agricultural production."
"I should also like to stress that assistance is needed not only outside the Union."
"Within the Union too, millions face the problem of high food prices and food shortages."
"I therefore ask that while helping others, for instance in Africa, we do not forget those waiting for our assistance close by."
"This is why we need to support the European Commission's proposal increasing funds for the food distribution programme for Europe's most deprived people."
"It is regrettable that some Member States are opposed to this programme."
"(ES) Madam President, in the framework of the current crisis, the United Nations has warned us of the dire situation faced by 22 particularly vulnerable countries, and the World Bank tells us that the 850 million people already going hungry in the world will be joined by a further 100 million as a result of the crisis."
"This situation required a swift, joint response from the European Union, and in July the Commission proposed a special financing facility to help farmers in developing countries and to try to mitigate soaring food prices."
"The measure sought both to increase agricultural production in those countries, where the effects of rising prices are felt most strongly, jeopardising chances of meeting the Millennium Development Objectives, and as far as possible to avoid instability and tensions that might endanger the results of years of investment in the political spheres of development and peacekeeping."
"We therefore welcome the agreement that has been reached, fulfilling a promise of adding EUR 1 billion that was made, as I was saying, at the highest political level ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate all those involved in this report and this very significant achievement: the rapporteur Gay Mitchell, all the political groups - including my own - and Commissioner Michel."
"Food prices and the collapsing global economy will have devastating effects on people in developing countries."
"It has been estimated that, for every 1% drop in the world GNP, 40 million more people will be driven into poverty."
"Consequently, it is extremely important that this proposal to cope with soaring food prices is implemented with urgency."
"The developing world is not the author of the current financial and economic crisis."
"If we are to avoid condemning another generation of people to abject poverty and hunger, we must avoid short-sighted penny-pinching in the field of development aid."
"As has already been pointed out, the figure of EUR 1 billion may seem large, but it is trifling compared to the amount of money we are pumping into banks and stimulus packages."
"I urge that this report be implemented as quickly as possible."
"(RO) The Council of the European Union should make national and international policies relating to the problem of guaranteeing food supplies to populations more coherent."
"High food prices are having serious repercussions for the poorest populations and are putting at risk the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"The introduction of the facility proposed by the regulation is a result of lower agricultural expenditure."
"The European Community needs to boost the growth of agricultural production in the short and medium term in developing countries, while reducing the adverse effects of rising food prices on the poorest sections of the population in developing countries."
"Community aid is not going to be used to pay taxes, duties or other charges."
"At the same time, this regulation must ensure protection for European farmers."
"(DE) Madam President, we have destroyed agriculture in developing countries by providing billions in export incentives and we have undermined food safety in these countries."
"If we think we can offset this with one billion, that is ridiculous!"
"I am in favour of this one billion being paid - do not get me wrong - but 850 million starving people are not the result of our having had high food prices but of our having pushed the prices to such a low level in these countries with our export incentives that agriculture no longer pays."
"The subsistence economy, owner farming and self-sufficiency have been destroyed."
"By this logic, if we now give them one billion, it will not help, instead it will aid destruction."
"We must therefore take great care as to how it is awarded."
"I am favour of our strengthening food safety long-term in these countries."
"This means that we must stop dumping exports on these markets."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, following this and some of the other contributions, I should like to make one important point very clear."
"This EUR 1 billion is in no way a structural response to the problem posed by the food crisis in developing countries."
"It is, in reality, a rapid reaction intended as an emergency response in order to save the forthcoming crops, that is to say those of 2008-2009 - I think that we might more properly talk of those of 2009, 2010 and perhaps 2011."
"I would also add that the underlying idea is that, at some time in the future, naturally, this rapid response capability could become permanent."
"In saying this, I am certainly going to worry a number of Member States."
"I have therefore said that this is a rapid, intact response."
"It is not the structural response."
"The structural response was basically alluded to by Mr Le Foll when he rightly voiced his concern that, for many years now, the share of the development aid budgets allocated to agriculture and rural development has been constantly shrinking."
"Clearly, I shall pass over the question of the responsibility for all this."
"I believe that, although undoubtedly acting in good faith, the international community has to some extent colluded in this withdrawal."
"Clearly, then, we now need to refocus on this issue."
"Progress has been made."
"I have already had the opportunity to present the figures to you."
"The ninth European Development Fund: four countries chose agriculture or rural development as a sector on which to focus or concentrate in their cooperation with the Commission."
"Four, representing EUR 650 million, in the tenth European Development Fund and, after much discussion, many suggestions and great insistence, we are now at a level of EUR 1.25 billion for 25 countries."
"Twenty-five countries is only a third of the total, however."
"There is therefore still work to be done."
"I believe, following on from what Mr Le Foll was saying, that the idea suggested by a number of the European Union's development ministers that, in five years' time, the bilateral development aid budgets focusing on agriculture should rise from an average of 10-15% is a good one."
"Clearly, these figures will have to be discussed."
"This will obviously make structural responses possible."
"This EUR 1 billion is therefore not meant to act as a structural response, or at least, not on a large scale."
"It is intended for emergency purposes."
"I must tell you that references to the situation of European farmers compared to the small farmers of developing countries present me with a moral problem."
"First of all, I do not think that it is right to compare them."
"I believe that the European farming community or, at any rate, family businesses, are facing a number of problems, but in the case of the EUR 1 billion we are talking about here, what was the starting point?"
"The starting point was the idea that, since prices had risen, the compensatory mechanism intended to cope with falls in prices and the loss of income for European farmers no longer had any purpose."
"The idea therefore emerged of using these sums, somewhat symbolically, to allocate to these other countries what had been planned for European farmers but had not proved to be necessary."
"I do not think that the situations should be compared."
"I most truly do not."
"Of course, I think that Europe's consumers and citizens have the right to our full consideration and I regret, furthermore, that it should be so difficult to help those in Europe who are in need of assistance, in particular by means of the aid which is currently being debated and on which little progress seems to have been made."
"We should not establish a link and we should not make our actions in favour of some dependent on our possibly parallel actions in favour of others."
"The two things are not the same; they are really not at all the same."
"First of all, we are not talking about the same levels of poverty and, secondly, I believe that we must remain consistent."
"This is a fundamental question which, in essence, perfectly frames the problem of the consistency of European policy with regard to agriculture."
"The problem was raised by Mr Borrell."
"It is clear that the real issue at hand that we must now monitor very closely and that will require us to be extremely responsive, both at the level of Parliament - which I know will act in this way - and of the Commission, and even of certain Members of the Council, concerns our Member States, which have accepted this formula, along with a number of other Member States, which have been forced and constrained to accept it, because we have had to fight."
"I express my sincere thanks to Parliament because I do not believe that this would have been possible without it."
"At a certain point, I even thought that we would not succeed, so increasingly specious and at the limits of intellectual honesty were the arguments being advanced."
"Of course, Mr Borrell, total vigilance will be required in order to observe whether the Member States or some of the Member States will not compensate for the commitment they have undertaken here."
"If this were to happen, it would clearly constitute nothing more than a fool's deal, and we would undoubtedly have to continue our efforts."
"I have just come back from Doha."
"I must admit that I am anything but wildly optimistic about the increase in public development aid."
"I must say that, when you leave meetings that have gone on for several hours - I admit that I sometimes have a rather volatile temperament but I am able, nevertheless, to keep my nerves in check - it can be difficult to put up with."
"It is difficult to put up with bad faith, with speeches that say that more public development aid is needed but, when a suitable text is drafted to reconfirm past commitments, suddenly there is no longer agreement and people invent all sorts of reasons not to undertake the commitment or, at any rate, to leave enough escape routes available to be able to turn their backs on their responsibilities and commitments in the most dishonourable way."
"So we will have to fight."
"Let us not be under any illusions about that."
"We shall have to accuse, expose, call on those responsible to face up to their responsibilities and, most of all - because I admit that I cannot put up with it anymore - undo, disassemble the double-speak, because the most terrible thing of all is that, at the very same time as they are making speeches of the most fabulous generosity, the speakers are treacherously doing all they can to stop the commitments from being honoured."
"We have therefore not seen the last of such behaviour, of that I am sure."
"Mr Virrankoski, the aid must arrive at its intended destination, and I believe in all honesty that, in the case we are discussing, it will arrive."
"Nevertheless, I must in some way demand consistency in the struggle we wish to undertake together."
"When we say, the aid must arrive at its intended destination, we are sending the worst possible message to the public, who we need in order to help us encourage States to increase their public development aid."
"We must stop saying the first thing that comes into our minds on this question."
"I think that the public aid that is dispensed by the Commission under your control and under the control of all the institutions whose task it is, does arrive at its intended destination."
"We may discuss our procedures, our rules, the fact that it is necessary to conduct consultations, audits, studies and so on, and that this has a cost, in a certain way, that it takes money, but, on the other hand, this is undoubtedly the price that has to be paid for genuine control and this is also the price that has to be paid for ensuring a minimum level of quality in delivering the service."
"We therefore have to know what we want, but I do not believe that you can say that the aid would not arrive at its intended destination."
"In the case in question here, I can confirm that all of this can be verified and checked and that we have all the procedures with which you, moreover, and I are familiar."
"I therefore honestly believe that we should not be too anxious about this."
"Mrs Aubert, I believe that, fundamentally, through your question or suggestion, you have given voice to what, for me, is also probably one of the negatives, one of the few real negatives, of the agreement, clearly, because, when considering the stability instrument, you have seen perfectly that what is taken from the stability instrument is money that is not necessarily available for other things and that, at root, this is, to tell the truth, a shift."
"It is, furthermore, what stops us, or, at any rate, what stops me, from claiming that this is an additional EUR 1 billion."
"We cannot really say that this is an additional EUR 1 billion, and Mr Mitchell has had the intellectual honesty to emphasise this."
"However, being completely objective, I nonetheless believe that this should not stop us from being happy because I did not really expect us to get this far."
"So the EUR 240 million will be redeployed from the stability instrument, and EUR 70 million of this in 2009."
"The available balance will, broadly speaking, be at the 2008 level, which was EUR 135 million."
"However, this is not really an argument."
"All things being equal, it is of course an argument."
"If any new requirements were placed on this instrument, we would have a problem."
"However, as far as 2010 is concerned, the Commission has been invited, during the budgetary conciliation phase, to present a revised financial programme designed to ensure the ordered progression of the amounts planned for the period 2010-2013 while retaining an unchanged annual margin level."
"This revised programming will be presented within the framework of the annual policy strategy, and we shall naturally monitor it closely."
"Turning to the questions you have asked concerning implementation: depending on the country, the choice will be made on the basis of criteria of effectiveness."
"Who might cooperate in this?"
"Clearly, the international and regional organisations, the countries themselves, the States and the decentralised authorities, the NGOs, as well as the agencies of the Member States."
"Moreover, if the number of types of operators has been extended, this is at Parliament's request."
"Personally, I admit that I was opposed to this but it was your wish and I can understand it."
"The criterion will be one of effectiveness, but if we want to act quickly, then you have to know that the best way of doing so is to work, as a priority, with the organisations set up for this very purpose and with which we can basically move more swiftly because we have rules for cooperating with these institutions that are capable of rapid action."
"However, I can assure you that we shall fully participate in this effort, as was decided by your Parliament and as was decided in the final agreement."
"Personally, I think that Europe has shown itself to be equal to the challenge because I believe that we are talking here about the EUR 1 billion for this rapid reaction to save the crops."
"I should also like to remind you of the hundreds of millions of euros that have already been released and spent and that we shall continue to spend within the framework of our emergency humanitarian aid or emergency food aid."
"Europe has been extremely responsive in these areas."
"I just want to remind you - and it gives me pleasure to do so here - that, in 2007, Europe represented EUR 46 billion per year."
"I have yet to see another donor provide as much development aid."
"As far as Mr Droutsas is concerned, to say that the European Union is washing its hands of this matter and that everything will be swallowed up by the businessmen is a view that I cannot share and that seems somewhat excessive to me."
"I am not saying that everything is completely wrong."
"For example, it is clear that we can discuss, debate the price of fertilisers and seed."
"We can indeed attempt to obtain an objective view of this question."
"It would probably not be a waste of energy, as part of the structural response, to attempt, at the level of the major international organisations - and this is something I am thinking about more and more - to negotiate with all these leading companies, which basically produce particularly effective seed but at an extremely high price."
"The same applies to fertilisers."
"There are initiatives that we should certainly consider, not least the idea of producing fertilisers locally, for example."
"There are places where this could be done."
"We could also create supply corridors that would make it possible greatly to reduce transport costs."
"I recently met a producers' organisation to get an idea about what they were prepared to do, and we are also going to hold a meeting between them and our business forum to see what they can bring to our structural response strategy."
"I obviously see this as important."
"Mrs Goudin, I am often in agreement with you but I have to say that I do not believe that protectionist policies are the solution in the countries that are facing this problem."
"In contrast I think that what would be interesting - because I believe that protectionist policies risk throwing everything off balance, or at least risk not responding to the problems at a regional level, although this is an economic dimension that I am not going to address now - where I would be willing to back you and where we are currently working intensely, in particular with the French Presidency, is on the following question: how can we organise the specific nature of agriculture in developing countries in the same way - we seem to have rather short memories in Europe - as Europe has done for its own agriculture?"
"In Europe, agriculture has never been considered to be a type of production or an economic product identical to all other economic products."
"Agriculture has always received special treatment."
"I will not yet say that this is my definitive option but, when we consider regional common agricultural policies, these, in my opinion, are objects of study that it would be interesting to take forward quite rapidly with the aim, of course, not of bringing about protectionism but protection - something quite different indeed."
"I prefer the concept of protection to the one of protectionism and the anxiety it causes."
"To conclude, I would just like once again - I hope that I have covered as much ground as possible - to thank you for the agreement and for your commitment."
"Without you, this would not have been possible."
"We have just convincingly demonstrated that, when the European Parliament and the Commission are able to work in harmony, it is difficult for the States to resist."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I thank the Commissioner and the Chairman, and the other Members who spoke, for their kind words about my contribution to this report."
"I would also like to thank Reimer Böge for his work in the Committee on Budgets in facilitating it and my shadow rapporteur, Thijs Berman, who was very supportive and helpful in seeing it through."
"In the developing world, 78 children per thousand die at birth."
"In the European Union the figure is 5 per thousand on average."
"It used to be 45 per thousand just after the Second World War in Ireland."
"We have got it down to 78 in the developing world, and we can get it down again to what used to be the rate in Ireland, and to what now is the rate in Ireland, with determination and commitment."
"If they get past birth, two million of those children will die before the age of five for lack of vaccines that have been available in the west for over 30 years."
"In that context, and when you see the hunger that those children will face, the lack of educational opportunity and the absence of health facilities, some of the contributions made here this evening bordered on inhumanity."
"Members playing to their national galleries at the expense of those people is obscene, and it is time that this was said very clearly."
"By 2050, the population of this planet will have increased from some 6 billion to some 8 billion. Ninety percent of those people will be born into what is now the developing world."
"If those people continue to exist in their present conditions, it will be the cause of the third conflagration on this planet, causing huge migration and huge problems."
"On the other hand, if we invest and work with those people in solidarity, they will be our trading partners."
"These are the options facing us and that is why I think it is important that we can respond with a facility such as this."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 December at 12 noon."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) I support this initiative providing the European Union with a new development policy instrument to tackle the key problems linked to the rise in food prices that has sparked riots, unrest and instability in several countries, threatening the results of many years of investment in politics, development and peace keeping."
"Hundreds of millions of people have seen their poverty exacerbated."
"The progress made towards achieving the Millenium Development Goals has been undermined."
"The Union plans to fund 10% of the EUR 18 billion required, that is to say EUR 1.8 billion and, given the funding already available, an additional package of EUR 1 billion is needed."
"I do not agree, however, with the European Commission's proposal to use funds reserved for agriculture and I hope that the Council will oppose this and will reach a compromise on this funding."
"Politically, it would be a disaster if, through financial means or worse, the use of symbols, European citizens were to feel that our development policy, in particular issues associated with hunger, were to operate at the expense of the common agricultural policy, which is a different matter."
"In my view, the Commission's proposal presents a limited number of options in terms of how financial aid can be granted as it stipulates that the initiatives should be implemented exclusively with the help of regional and global organisations."
"I understand the motives behind these restrictions, but I support the active involvement of all stakeholders: consumers, producers and the general public too."
"It goes without saying that farming conditions vary in developing countries."
"However, the facility needs to be adapted to specific local conditions, with a view to consolidating and streamlining markets."
"Small farmers need to be protected against the development of possible dominant positions on the market."
"Introducing this type of facility is beneficial and provides an incentive to farmers in developing countries."
"It is also appropriate in the context of the current global economic and financial crisis."
"However, I would like to emphasise the importance of the condition that funds are allocated on a supplementary basis and that this is not detrimental to development activities required in other areas."
"We need to strictly observe the commitments we have undertaken."
"We also need to protect farmers, especially those from the new Member States who still do not enjoy the same support as farmers from the other 15 Member States."
"in writing. - (ET) For years, experts on the right to food at the UN, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have warned the global public of the possibility of famine."
"At a time when wealthy Western countries are burning food, more than 850 million people are starving across the world."
"Every five seconds, one child below the age of 10 dies from a lack of food."
"The rapid increase in the price of foodstuffs affects 2.1 billion people worldwide on a daily basis, many of whom are trying to survive on less than USD 2 per day."
"The ever-increasing scale of biofuel production has contributed towards raising the price of foodstuffs, which has in turn had a large effect upon the people of the world."
"The price of foodstuffs has skyrocketed on the world market because an ever-increasing area of arable land is now being put aside to grow oil plants to be used as raw material in the production of biofuel (for example, to produce 50 litres of fuel, 200 kilograms of corn is needed, on which a Zambian or Mexican child could live for a whole year)."
"In addition, several countries have suffered through drought or flooding, which has considerably decreased their harvest yield."
"It is my view that the European Union should be willing to contribute more rigorously in its pursuit of the UN Millennium Development Goal: to halve world famine by the year 2015."
"I welcome the European Commission's initiative to direct EUR 1 billion into solving the foodstuff crisis."
"This will allow for the provision of EU food aid to the most disadvantaged people in order to satisfy their primary nutritional needs and contribute towards increasing the capacity of developing countries to produce their own foodstuffs."
"At the moment, relatively little motor fuel is produced from edible crops in Europe."
"However, we should not sacrifice human foodstuffs purely for the sake of 'green energy'."
"Rather, support must be given to scientific research with the goal of producing motor fuel from alternative sources."
"This would help to avoid an increase in the price of foodstuffs, and would also help to prevent famine and global warming."
"in writing. - (PL) The past two years have seen an escalation of agricultural produce and food prices."
"These changes have been felt most painfully by nations in the most difficult economic situation and countries at war."
"Approximately 2.1 billion people throughout the world must survive on less than two dollars a day, which means that they spend approximately 50% of their income on food."
"These are the people most at risk of disease and death due to the record prices of their staple foods, namely cereals such as rice, corn and wheat."
"This has a direct impact on the number of starving people, which increased by another 50 million in the year 2007 alone."
"The crisis is further intensified by the adverse impact of the climate change and by the shortage of such natural resources as water and energy."
"As part of our aid and attempts to address this crucial issue, we need to invest the funds intended to improve access to resources of agricultural production and services and to increase agricultural production capacity, in order to satisfy the basic food needs of developing countries."
"The European Union must also increase its expenditure on agriculture, since the 4% allocated to development policy so far is decidedly too little."
"Of equal importance is a return to the minimal regulation of international markets, to ensure supplies and at least a relative stability, in the interest of all consumers and producers throughout the world."
"in writing. - I welcome the timely report on the proposal for a regulation establishing a facility for rapid response to soaring food prices in developing countries."
"This year the world has been shaken by various crises that have taken a terrible toll on the poorest populations of the world."
"It has been proposed that one billion euros are to be spent to improve their situation over the period from 2008 to 2009, which is quite a notable sum in the European Union budget."
"But I would like to remind you that most European Union humanitarian and development aid is not directed by the Commission but by the Member States."
"If the Member States fulfilled their commitments to the Millennium Development Goals, the Commission would not have to take such action."
"The rapporteur has rightfully pointed out that one cannot desire more effective common policies without providing more budgetary resources, yet the Member States seem rather reluctant to do that."
"In my opinion, the Member States ought to start pooling their resources under the auspices of the Commission to exercise a truly effective common humanitarian and development policy."
"Concerning the report on a facility for responding rapidly to soaring food prices in developing countries, I am definitely in favour of its adoption, since developing countries need this kind of assistance."
"At the same time, though, I would like to point out that the report failed to include among the causes of the crisis one which in my view is far more important than the increased consumption of meat in China and India or the drought in Australia."
"I would remind you that food prices are also increasing within the European Union and it is abundantly clear that the constant increases are due to rising energy prices which in turn relate directly to the mounting profits of multinational energy firms."
"Neoliberalism has become the model for all of the EU's policies, but in reality it will not solve the problem of food sufficiency anywhere in the world."
"in writing. - (SK) The record high prices for staple foods, which have a major impact on the numbers of people suffering from hunger in the world, are due to several well-known factors."
"Apart from the specific situation in some countries (such as China and India) these factors include global fluctuations in the weather, the shift from growing crops for consumption to growing crops for biofuel production and low world grain stocks."
"In this context I consider it essential for the EU to develop a unified, coordinated and effective response."
"I welcome the Commission proposal to establish a fund for handling the food crisis, particularly at a time when higher food prices are increasing the cost of the food aid which is needed by increasing numbers of people."
"We must not forget that we are using EU taxpayers' money for development aid."
"Neither the sharp food price increases in developing countries nor the results of these increases on the poorest people can justify us in failing to ensure the effective and transparent allocation of these funds."
"In view of the unstable regimes in many developing countries, the violations of democracy and the corruption I am very reluctant to prop up their national budgets."
"I would prefer to support projects and programmes that are managed by non-governmental or semi-governmental organisations, consortiums or associations representing these."
"Two years ago I made a proposal adopted in a plenary session for aid to be monitored and assessed twice a year and then signed off by the Commission, the local state authorities and the aid recipients."
"Combating tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions (common system of VAT) - Combating tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions - European Court of Auditors' Special Report No 8/2007 concerning administrative cooperation in the Field of VAT (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the report by José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax as regards tax evasion linked to import and other cross-border transactions - C6-0154/2008 -,"
"the report by José Manuel García-Margallo y Marfil on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Proposal for a Council Regulation on the amendment of Regulation (EC) No. 1798/2003 to combat tax evasion connected with intra-Community transactions"
"- C6-0155/2008 - and"
"the report by Bert Staes on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the European Court of Auditors' Special Report No 8/2007 concerning administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax"
"."
"Madam President, I must start by regretting that the Commissioner responsible is not here with us, although I am not really surprised, because there is plenty of noise and not much substance on this subject: great rhetorical statements about combating VAT fraud and very few measures with which to do so."
"The communications that the Commissioner has presented to us, the last of which was on 1 December this year, make quite a fuss about the damage that tax evasion causes."
"It affects sufficiency, it affects equity and it causes market distortions with really major amounts of money."
"VAT fraud accounts for between EUR 60 billion and EUR 100 billion every year."
"How can fraud be stopped?"
"The diagnosis given in these communications is also generally correct, rhetorical and grandiloquent."
"They say that the national authorities have the responsibility to tackle fraud, but that operations where the supplier and the customer do not reside in the same country require cooperation between Member States."
"They also point out that the Court of Auditors, in its Special Report No 8, states that such cooperation has been clearly unsatisfactory and that action therefore needs to be taken."
"The problem comes when the Commissioner starts telling us what kinds of action need to be taken."
"He quite reasonably says that there are two strategies: one, which he calls ambitious, comprises a major reform of value-added tax, involving either a reverse-charge system or a tax withholding system with a clearing house, while the other is what the Commissioner calls 'conventional measures'."
"We gathered from his appearance here on 24 June that he was not thinking of embarking on an ambitious reform under any circumstances and that he would confine himself to the 'conventional measures'."
"Subsequently, however, when he described the conventional measures, he put forward four that in principle are not bad."
"He talked about cutting compulsory declaration deadlines, enhancing cooperation among tax authorities, establishing shared liability when the purchaser of the goods does not declare who sold them, and improving the information on VAT taxpayers."
"He then concluded by saying that not even these four measures were among the concrete measures he was thinking of adopting."
"Today he comes up with two proposed amendments to the directive and regulation."
"He says that the aim of the first is to reduce the period for lodging the statements that VAT taxpayers have to submit from three months to one month, and the aim of the second is to reduce the period for transmitting the information to the Member State that has to charge the tax from three months to one month."
"Full stop."
"That is all the proposal lays down."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has tried to spice up this really insipid story a little, and we have put forward the following amendments."
"We have approved an amendment favouring small and medium-sized enterprises, the purpose of which is to reconcile fighting tax evasion with simplification of the administrative burden on small enterprises, to which this Parliament and the EU as a whole have a commitment."
"We therefore say that the Commission must shortly, within two years, present us with a report describing how these measures have performed, how they have affected the administrative costs of businesses and to what extent they have been useful in combating tax evasion."
"We also point out that the Commission should get rather more involved than it has been when making legislation."
"It should play a more leading role."
"We also call on it to centralise the data that the Member States involved transfer, to draw up a handbook of best practice so that the tax authorities can perform better, to develop indicators to show which areas are risky and which are not, and to tell us who is complying and who is not."
"Lastly, to make it easier to pursue fraudsters, we are setting up a register of individuals who cannot evade tax by setting up companies."
"I regret the fact that the Commissioner cannot respond to the amendments that we have drawn up."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tax fraud and VAT fraud are punishable offences."
"They may be white-collar crimes, but they are crimes nevertheless, and are sometimes related to organised crime."
"What are the sums involved, because that always makes it interesting?"
"In 2007, Commissioner Kovács estimated total fiscal fraud to be two to two and a half times the European budget, or a sum between EUR 200 and 250 billion."
"The share of VAT fraud in this is estimated at EUR 40 billion."
"All of this is probably a major underestimate, for the Court of Auditors estimated the loss of VAT income in 2005 to be EUR 17 billion in Germany and 18.2 billion in the United Kingdom, together responsible for just over EUR 35 billion of lost VAT revenue."
"It is therefore to be welcomed that the Commission has funded a study, that this study is up and running, and that the results will be made public, so that we can see the true extent of the problem."
"There are two basic problems where policy is concerned."
"First of all, cooperation between national tax authorities must improve and, secondly, we should really aim for shorter deadlines when the administrative bodies of the Member States gather and exchange information, so that things can be processed much more quickly."
"My report mainly analyses the Court of Auditors' inquiry into VAT fraud."
"The Court of Auditors checked in seven Member States: in France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia and the United Kingdom."
"These countries cooperated well."
"Germany, though, refused all cooperation."
"In September, the Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Germany, something which, I have to say, Commissioner, I support."
"The Court of Auditors has established that, in some Member States, the essential conditions for effective cooperation when it comes to controlling this form of fraud are completely lacking."
"My co-rapporteur pointed out that it takes longer than three months for requests for information to be dealt with."
"This is, in actual fact, inexcusable, because, in fact, these crimes should be combated in real time."
"The countries' internal organisation has also come under fire, though."
"The Netherlands and Germany, in particular, leave something to be desired."
"Moreover, there is a total lack of sufficiently strong control mechanisms."
"It remains a mystery to me why Member States refuse to take a firm stand, even though they know they miss out on billions of revenue."
"This is really beyond me."
"The free movement of criminals is a fact of life."
"A united Europe in the fight against tax fraud remains a pipe dream to a large extent."
"There is also good news, though."
"My own Member State, Belgium, has set up the European Carousel Network (Eurocanet network) that guarantees a spontaneous exchange of information."
"This, too, is flawed, though, since only 24 Member States have lent their cooperation, and three of the major Member States, to wit Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, have refused to cooperate."
"The Ecofin Council of 7 October has launched a new mechanism, namely the Eurofisc mechanism, to improve cooperation between the Member States in the control of VAT fraud."
"This is an initiative which, to my mind, is sound but will only add value if all Member States participate and if this is more than simply intergovernmental cooperation."
"I firmly believe that the Commission should be involved in this new initiative."
"It could in any event take part and even play a coordinating role."
"Finally, I also think that we should work much more closely together in the judicial field too."
"All existing judicial obstacles in national law for cross-border, criminal prosecution should be removed without delay."
"In my report, I have included a list of measures to be taken."
"I should like to receive a response, or reaction, from the Commission, and I regret that the Council is not present because, at the end of the day, it is the Council that will have to take action in this area."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the European Parliament and more especially the two rapporteurs, Mr García-Margallo y Marfil and Mr Staes, for the constructive reports they have presented on the delicate subject of the fight against VAT fraud within the European Union, in particular with regard to the Commission's first concrete proposal in this field."
"We are today at a turning point in the implementation of our strategy to combat VAT fraud."
"The three reports that are to be adopted by Parliament tomorrow contain a number of recommendations on the way in which to improve the fight against fraud and reflect your opinion on the first of what will be a long series of measures."
"On 1 December, the Commission adopted a communication specifying the measures that it will present in the coming months, as well as an initial directive containing some of these measures."
"The envisaged proposals also respond to the concerns and recommendations expressed in the report by Mr Staes."
"The measures that the Commission intends to adopt can be subdivided into three categories:"
"The first brings together measures intended to prevent VAT fraud."
"One of these consists in establishing minimum standards for registration and de-registration in national databases in order to improve the reliability and comparability of information contained therein."
"Improvements to the procedure used to obtain electronic confirmation of operators' VAT numbers and the corresponding names and addresses are also planned in order to guarantee greater legal certainty for suppliers."
"Finally, the Commission is proposing to simplify the rules governing invoicing and to rationalise those concerning the chargeability of tax in order to guarantee its improved application, a move that will facilitate controls."
"The second category relates to measures intended to improve the effectiveness of tax authorities with a view to detecting VAT fraud."
"The measure concerning the cutting of deadlines, which is dealt with in the two reports by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, falls into this category."
"To improve the detection of fraud, it is also necessary to ensure that exemptions from VAT on imports are better monitored, as the Commission proposed last Monday, and to extend the scope of the information that Member States will have to make available to the tax authorities of the other Member States via automated access to their databases."
"Finally, as you indicated, this category also includes the creation of a European network, known as Eurofisc."
"The latter is intended to improve operational cooperation between the Member States in the fight against VAT fraud on the model of the Eurocanet network, which was set up by the Belgian tax authorities and which is supported by the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office."
"The third category comprises measures intended to strengthen tax authorities' capabilities with regard to the levying and collection of taxes."
"These include, in particular, a measure that specifies the cases in which suppliers and customers making cross-border transactions are held jointly responsible for the payment of tax."
"This is no doubt intended to strengthen the legal framework governing cross-border tax collection."
"Finally, they include a measure intended to establish shared responsibility between the Member States in order to protect overall tax revenues."
"The Commission also notes that Parliament has demonstrated an ongoing concern to ensure the protection of the European Community's financial interests, given that VAT fraud also has consequences for the European budget's own resources."
"I welcome the support given to the proposal for a regulation on mutual administrative assistance in the fight against fraud and, in particular, against VAT fraud."
"The Commission also welcomes the request made by Parliament to the Council to continue negotiations on this proposal, which will provide a detailed framework enabling the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office to provide the Member States with operational support and information as part of their fight against VAT fraud."
"The positive opinion expressed by Parliament in the draft report on the cutting of deadlines and the rapid progress of the work conducted on this issue within the Council bode well for the more far-reaching proposals that the Commission will adopt in the near future."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (PL) Madam President, controlling fraud, hitherto chiefly within the province of Member States, is a problem which cannot be resolved solely at the national level."
"Combating tax evasion must involve closer cooperation between the administrative authorities of Member States, as well as cooperation with the Commission."
"The proposals for the Directive and Regulation forming the subject of the Draft arise only partly from the priority recommendations made by ECOFIN in June 2007."
"The proposed changes have as their main purpose speeding up gathering and exchanging information about intra-Community procedures, by standardising the procedures and by reducing to one month the period covered by declarations on intra-Community transactions and the time limit for the exchange of information about these transactions between Member States."
"Harmonisation of VAT requirements will ensure effective verification of the information provided."
"Requiring Member Sates to accept electronically submitted VAT returns will also significantly simplify the process."
"The proposed legislative instruments represent no more than the first steps towards putting the above ECOFIN proposals into practice."
"We do not yet have a detailed assessment of the impact of the new formal requirements on service providers, and it would be advisable to prepare a special report dealing with this issue, especially as it relates to the administrative costs borne by taxpayers and administrative authorities and the effectiveness of combating tax evasion."
"Bearing in mind the justified criticism offered by the Court of Auditors, concerning the lack of effective administrative cooperation in this area, the European Commission should consider playing a greater role, especially where preparing analyses and providing good models is concerned."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, approximately 2.25% of the gross domestic product of the EU, in figures approximately EUR 200 billion a year - as Mr Staes has already said - is lost in value added tax evasion, circumvention and fraud."
"Those are the facts on which Mr Staes' report is rightly based."
"From the replies to five written questions on this topic which I put to the Council and Commission - by the way, I also regret that the Council is so sparsely represented - it has emerged, among other things, that in 2005 value added tax losses in Germany alone amounted to EUR 17 billion and in the United Kingdom to EUR 18 billion."
"These figures really make it clear to everyone that considerable damage is being done to the national economy and that this must be stopped as soon as possible."
"How is this to be accomplished, however?"
"The answer to date was - according to the Court of Auditors, which has devoted itself to this topic in a special report - through cooperation between the national administrative authorities responsible, but that is precisely what has not worked at all in recent years."
"Once again Europeans find themselves in a situation where they are pursuing a well-intentioned goal but are counting their chickens before they are hatched."
"And in this case the chickens are the Member States which are unable to crack down on international evasion of value added tax by means of administrative measures."
"Thus, for example, there are major unexplained differences in the figures for requests for information received and requests for information answered."
"The mirror image differences in the statistics for intra-Community trade notified by the Commission in reply to my written question of 6 May, which are supposed to have amounted to the princely sum of EUR 77 billion in 2007, may also be an indication of value added tax fraud."
"I would take this opportunity to ask the Commission when the results of the study will be presented to us."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SK) Colleagues, imagine that there was no tax evasion in the European Union."
"If the funds acquired in this way were distributed fairly, every citizen of the European Union, including children and pensioners, would have EUR 500 more in their wallet every year."
"No country can combat tax evasion effectively on its own."
"International cooperation is imperative, especially in the VAT area, where the monitoring of intra-Community transactions is complicated by the current system."
"One solution with a long-term positive effect in combating tax evasion would be the creation of a VAT system under which transactions between Member States would be taxed at a rate other than zero."
"The zero-rate tax on exports of goods is being abused by fraudsters and criminal groups that, for example, create fictitious transactions and fraudulently drain billions of euros from state budgets."
"The current long deadlines for the submission of tax returns also provide room for the commission of such tax frauds."
"The report on the draft directive that we are discussing now represents an acceleration of the exchange of information necessary for the fight against tax fraud."
"That is one of the reasons we are shortening the deadline for the submission of tax returns for intra-Community transactions."
"The VAT system created in 1993 is only transitional."
"I believe that at the beginning of the next term of office, the Commission will present more ambitious measures dealing with final and comprehensive VAT reform."
"The provisional nature of the current system is one of the reasons why in my amendment, which was approved by the Committee, I request that the Commission evaluate the impact of the adopted measures three years earlier than was proposed in the original amendment proposal."
"This is to avoid a situation where the system would be evaluated at a time when it is no longer in force."
"To conclude, I wish to thank and congratulate the rapporteur on a well-balanced report."
"The draft allows for an early response to tax fraud."
"It is also positive that business people themselves have stated that the administrative burden will be minimal."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Madam President, when the Court of Auditors says that the volume of VAT fraud could be greater than the total budget of the Community and Mr Staes asserts that this figure must be more than doubled, the discussion of these reports is fully justified."
"In particular, it is obvious that Member States must support the creation of a register of natural persons who use shell companies for tax evasion."
"I also support the proposals of Mr Staes."
"Having said this, it is not avoidance of payment of VAT that is the main problem in terms of tax evasion in Europe, because there is a type of legal evasion that is permitted and allowed by governments in the shape of offshore financial centres."
"It is in these centres that the proceeds of crime are laundered and legitimate funds become criminalised."
"When the money from our taxes is ending up being used to bail out banks and bankers, the end of tax havens is the real test of courage that is being set for Europe in the near future."
"That is how we will be judged and we are still light years away from what is required regarding tax evasion."
"(SK) Madam President, honourable Members of Parliament and guests, it is indisputable that tax evasion causes significant disruption to competition and the functioning of the internal market, and reduces public revenues."
"The explanatory statement is not completely convincing when it states that the proposed measures, aimed solely at accelerating the collection and exchange of data relating to intra-Community transactions, will not represent an excessive burden for the entrepreneurial sector."
"At the same time, the Commission's explanatory statement recognises doubts in the entrepreneurial sector regarding the ability of tax authorities to utilise the information provided."
"The statement does nothing to dispel these doubts."
"Nevertheless, the measures aimed at combating tax evasion need to start somewhere."
"Probably only practice will show whether the proposed measure works or becomes just another administrative burden for the entrepreneurial sector."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to consider both the report and the problem itself from the point of view of firstly fraud, secondly budget loss and thirdly distortion of business competitiveness, since tax fraud undermines the principles of fair competition."
"I wish to express my special appreciation of the report and the rapporteur, Mr Staes, who has produced an excellent report."
"It is one of the few reports which not only refers to the amounts but also names the Member States where these irregularities occur."
"I also wish to express my gratitude to the Court of Auditors, which has highlighted two main groups of reasons."
"Firstly reasons associated with Member States, which we could interpret as a kind of passivity on the part of the Council, or inertia on the part of Member States, that could make a significant contribution to solving the problem by taking seemingly simple steps such as the prompt exchange of information, reliable exchange of information and demonstrating the will to identify and eliminate the causes of the existing state of affairs."
"There is also a second important issue, which was not given sufficient prominence in the Commissioner's address: what can the Commission, together with its subordinate agencies, such as the Directorate General for Taxation and Customs Union, and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), actually do, in place of the frequently bureaucratic explanation along the lines of however much effort we make, so far it has produced no results?"
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the observations and points of view that you have expressed during this debate."
"The Commission will take account of the suggestions made by the European Parliament in its current and future legislative proposals."
"I am pleased to note that the opinions of the European Parliament are similar to those of the Commission with regard to the measures to be taken to improve the fight against VAT fraud within the European Union."
"I am particularly happy about the widespread support for the main objective of the Commission's first concrete proposal, namely to accelerate, by January 2010, the gathering and exchange of information concerning intra-community transactions."
"We have spoken about the impact assessment."
"The Commission has examined the effects on business costs."
"It appears that these costs are limited."
"In order to examine the real effects more precisely, the Commission is ready to produce an evaluation report."
"The preliminary results of the current assessment, to which you refer, Mrs Stauner, will be known during the course of the coming weeks and will then be validated in cooperation with the Member States."
"The Commission, I am told, can only accept Amendments 4 and 7 of the report ..."
"Are you therefore unable to accept Amendments 4 and 7 of the report?"
"In fact, we can accept Amendments 4 and 7 of Mr García-Margallo y Marfil's report."
"I apologise for proceeding in this way but I am not, as you will have noticed and as you know, the responsible Commissioner, and I am therefore far less expansive on these issues, which are extremely challenging for me, than on others."
"Believe me, Commissioner Michel, I appreciate your kindness in being here with us and dealing with topics that actually are tough for anyone."
"The Commission asked us to be quick and we have responded swiftly."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs duly issued its opinion in good time and, in a rare show of unanimity, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved the report that we are debating today."
"Commissioner, you have read out to us the proposals that the Council adopted on 1 December, from the notes that were prepared for you in the Committee on Fiscal Affairs."
"Those proposals, however, are not precisely the ones that we are debating here."
"What we are debating is something else."
"I am not surprised that they have told us what they are thinking of doing, because what they have actually done is very little, as I said before."
"The speed with which Parliament has acted on this really important topic, as my fellow Members have pointed out, has not been matched by enthusiasm in either the Commission or the Council."
"A very important committee chairman once said that he expected 'de l'audace, encore de l'audace et toujours de l'audace' from the Commission - boldness, more boldness and forever boldness."
"The Commission holds a monopoly on legislative initiative, and this Parliament has wanted it to be so, but holding this monopoly means that these initiatives have to be put on show and proposed boldly and fearlessly, without holding back for fear that the Council may not approve them."
"Initiatives need to be launched, pushed forward and fought for, and the Council will have to answer to the Commission and to this Parliament if the proposals are not successful."
"This has not been the case."
"What I described in my earlier speech was a story of declining ambition, from the most absolute proposals to conventional measures, to a package of measures from which only two, the most modest of them, are selected."
"I am grateful to Mr Michel and ask him to pass on to the Commissioner responsible my thanks for having accepted a couple of amendments, but I feel really frustrated by what we have debated here."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I can only endorse what Mr García-Margallo y Marfil had to say."
"To my mind, both reports, in fact the three reports that are before us, and the way in which they have been approved, by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the one hand and the Committee on Budgetary Control on the other, demonstrate a high level of resolve - a resolve not to take this lightly."
"A great deal of money is involved."
"Just imagine we could only recoup even a quarter of that money."
"We would end up with a fund of EUR 60 billion in the Member States and in the European Union."
"We need this money."
"Mr Verheugen, who is here today, knows he has an important job to do."
"We therefore know what we are fighting for."
"We are also fighting unfairness and injustice."
"After all, those who fail to pay their taxes, who try to evade them, display anti-social behaviour."
"This is therefore something that calls for resolve in this House."
"I should like to say to Commissioner Michel that I understand his response."
"He has his own competences."
"He is here to replace someone else, and I can understand that he is simply reading out a response."
"That is not a problem."
"I will take his text with me, and we will work with it."
"I would like to ask the Commission, though, not just to discuss the study on the extent of fraud, which should be ready by the end of the year, with the Member States, but also to submit it to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Budgetary Control, so that we can include a number of other aspects too."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 4 December 2008 at 12 noon."
"Written Statements (Article 142)"
"The report in question is particularly important due to the fact that it introduces mechanisms aimed at eliminating or reducing the opportunities for defrauding the budget by means of fraudulent intra-Community transactions liable for VAT."
"At the moment, annual losses generated as a result of carrying out fictitious transactions involving missing traders is estimated at EUR 100 million (16% of the EU's actual resources)."
"Reducing the deadlines both for collecting information and exchanging it between the Member States' tax authorities can help to improve monitoring of transactions of this type."
"According to an approved amendment to the report in question, put forward by the Commission, the tax authorities in the Member States will be connected to a shared database where details will be registered of the physical persons behind the missing traders responsible for carrying out fraudulent transactions of this nature."
"This will deter these traders from continuing to set up other companies anywhere in the whole of the European Union, and not just in a single Member State, as happens at the moment."
"This will be achieved as they will be identified in real time when a check is run on the database and also because the information will be sent to the commercial register to which the application for registering a new company has been made."
"in writing. - (PL) As I take the floor in a debate devoted to combating tax fraud, I should like to draw attention to the following issues."
"The loss of income resulting from VAT fraud in the various Member States is extremely high, and increases every year."
"For instance in Germany in the year 2005 the loss was approximately EUR 17 billion and in the United Kingdom in the 2005-2006 tax year it was over EUR 18 billion."
"In spite of the fact that the European Union has introduced many initiatives to combat VAT fraud, such as EUROCANET (a network for exchange of information about companies suspected of VAT fraud, which unfortunately does not include Germany, United Kingdom or Italy), and of the work of institutions such as Europol, Eurojust and OLAF, these losses increase significantly year by year."
"In the circumstances, we should abandon actions leading to the creation of new intergovernmental agencies, and instead strengthen the role of the European Commission as the central coordinator of administrative cooperation between individual Member States concerned with combating VAT fraud."
"Consequently, it is at least debatable whether we should create a new mechanism, Eurofisc, conceived as a new decentralised network in which Member States would participate on a voluntary basis."
"in writing . - (PL) The report on combating tax evasion in relation to intra Community transactions is a very significant legal act."
"Tax fraud amounts to an attack on the principle of fair and transparent taxation."
"It also undermines the basis on which the Union operates."
"Less money going into the Union's budget means we are unable to implement policies in full."
"Combating tax fraud falls largely within the competence of the Member States."
"The latter should not, however, act in isolation."
"There is a clear need to coordinate work at Community level and to strengthen cooperation between the national administrations of Member States and the European Commission."
"Reform of VAT is a long-term and time-consuming process."
"Accordingly, the report discussed states that conventional resources should be used."
"The latter involve changes to legislation in the area of the taxpayer's responsibility should the necessary documents not be submited on time or be submitted incorrectly."
"Other changes include shortening the time for obtaining the information and swift correction of inaccurate data, together with the acceleration of exchange of information linked to intra Community transactions."
"Implementation of REACH (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the pre-registration of phase-in substances according to the REACH Regulation - (B6-0490/2008)."
"author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will not take up a great deal of your time because this is a well-known topic."
"We are talking about the pre-registration of chemical substances, a preliminary stage, in fact the first stage in implementing REACH, which is very important."
"This is because it offers companies the opportunity to establish the right to apply a transitional regime, in other words, stagger the times specified for registering substances."
"This is a more demanding procedure which above all, even more importantly, can lead to the formation of groups of companies for sharing data."
"This means that data can be presented jointly by producers of the same substance."
"As we are all well aware, we have received information to the effect that, compared to the initial forecasts which the REACH system was based on, the number of pre-registrations has not only been high, but actually far higher than predicted."
"We were talking in terms of a few hundred thousand, but the number of substances which have been pre-registered, and the Commissioner will certainly give us the exact figures for this, has probably passed the million mark. This presents a problem for us as it also raises a lot of questions about the causes of this explosion, or phenomenon you might say, which could even be positive."
"The main thing we know is that this avalanche of data, though still preliminary basic information, has severely tested the ability of the newly formed European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki to handle it."
"Our question then is exactly this: we want to know how these problems were tackled, what kind of structure has been set up if problems have been caused for the companies who have been very anxious, for want of a better term, about being able to meet the deadline."
"The deadline for submitting these pre-registrations expired at 12 midnight on 1 December."
"We also want to know what are the Commission's analysis and initial assessment of this phenomenon and what problems it may well cause during the next phase of implementing this regulation."
"author. - Madam President, like Guido Sacconi I can be fairly concise about this."
"This was perhaps the biggest dossier that this Parliament has known in recent years."
"It is one of the biggest operations on which it has embarked, and is of crucial importance in terms of the health and safety of people as they handle, use and consume chemicals which may be hazardous, dangerous or risky and so require great care."
"That is why we set up REACH."
"That is why we brought in the pre-registration process and, subsequently, the authorisation process."
"That is why we are concerned to hear that it has snowballed in such a way as to almost suffocate this newborn agency."
"Guido Sacconi said that he was not sure about the number of pre-registrations, but he thought that they were over one million. I can tell you that, on 1 December, when the process closed, that figure was over 2 million."
"It was 2 212 129 registrations from 65 655 companies. That is the scale of what has happened."
"The question is: why so many?"
"The answer, I suspect, is because a lot of firms were advised to take precautionary measures in case they had to go through the much more expensive processes later."
"But the question then is: in September when we were first alerted to this, was the Commission able to step in to give support?"
"Does the Commission believe that the registration process will now be adequate, and what steps will it take to make sure that the rest of this Agency's processes work smoothly and effectively?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Sacconi and the other authors because their question gives me the opportunity to report to the European Parliament on the indeed astounding results of the pre-registration procedure within the framework of REACH."
"Pre-registration of the chemical substances available on the EU market is the first procedure within the framework of REACH."
"It represents the precondition for extended registration periods for companies, which then extend to 2018."
"The pre-registration period stipulated in the REACH Regulation began on 1 June 2008 and ended on 1 December 2008, in other words six months later."
"In adopting the regulation we had assumed that we would have to reckon on the registration of approximately 200 000 chemical substances."
"In actual fact, by the end of the pre-registration period there had been precisely 2 236 625 registrations."
"Several thousand collective applications are currently still being processed and may still increase this figure considerably."
"The final figure will be made known by the agency in mid-December."
"Naturally, we too asked how it was possible that the estimates which formed the basis of our legislation had been exceeded tenfold."
"The simple answer is for precisely the reason that REACH was developed: because we simply did not know - because no one knew precisely - how many substances we had available."
"It has emerged that the extent of the task was underestimated by all those concerned."
"The estimates were made with the aid of all available data from the Member States and industry."
"Naturally, they initially resulted in problems occurring when it turned out that the working hypothesis had been wrong."
"That was quite inevitable."
"According to the REACH Regulation, it was the task of the agency in Helsinki to establish the format for pre-registration and to make it freely available on its website."
"The REACH IT system and the corresponding format for pre-registration of the substances concerned was available to companies on time on 1 June of this year."
"In the course of October and November companies informed the Commission that the REACH IT system operated by the agency was working with reduced performance or at certain times not at all."
"The Commission subsequently monitored the agency's operations very carefully and discussed improvements to the software and even an emergency plan with the agency."
"Throughout the entire pre-registration period, the agency worked hard to improve the performance and efficiency of the IT system."
"In view of the rapid increase in pre-registration figures in recent weeks - up to 100 000 pre-registrations on a single day at times - the agency has taken additional technical measures and expanded its capacity."
"These changes made it possible to improve the availability and speed of the system."
"Nonetheless, at peak access times a delayed response could not be completely avoided because of the extremely high number of simultaneous requests."
"It really is the case - and a few questions can be linked to this - that almost half of all the pre-registration applications were submitted in the last two weeks of the pre-registration period, that is to say, more than one million in the last two weeks."
"For this reason the agency recommended performing pre-registration outside peak times in the event of difficulties."
"In addition, companies were advised to use the format for collective registration, which was the fastest option."
"In the last phase of pre-registration the agency set up an additional, rapid telephone answering service for help with any problems."
"Due to this measure, the response time in the REACH IT system constantly improved despite the high number of pre-registration applications."
"Finally, the prepared alternative procedure was only used on the very last pre-registration day and only proved necessary to a limited extent as the REACH IT system operated adequately until the last after all."
"I am assuming that, despite the difficulties which occurred, all the companies concerned were in a position to pre-register their substances and that the first implementation phase of REACH was thus successfully concluded."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Madam President, I want to thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"In view of the fact that the number wanting to pre-register was so incredibly higher than we had first thought, I think we can still say that a lot has worked."
"After all, despite everything 2.2 million people have succeeded in registering - and from 65 000 different businesses, as Mr Bowis said."
"No doubt it is actually a good thing that we are made aware of how much the chemicals are used."
"Perhaps it indicates a certain nervousness and a feeling of 'better safe than sorry' which is resulting in people registering even though the same use may already have been registered, et cetera. However, we will not be able to tell whether this is the case until later."
"As a result, however, I wish to ask a follow-up question."
"In sharp contrast to the number that have pre-registered their chemicals, we have extremely few chemicals on the candidate list of the most dangerous chemicals."
"There are just 15 at present, when we have 27 PBTs and 800 other chemicals that should already be included here."
"Imagine if there were to be a very rapid increase in these."
"In future proceedings within REACH and as we approach the next deadline, how will the European Chemicals Agency cope when decisions are required from it?"
"In my judgment, we need to increase the workforce of the European Chemicals Agency substantially if REACH is to succeed."
"Otherwise I believe that at the end of the next stage, when we need decisions from the Agency, they will have no chance of making the required decisions in time."
"I therefore really believe that we must make provision at this stage for a substantially increased budget for the European Chemicals Agency."
"author. - (IT) Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner because I found that the answers he gave were very persuasive."
"I understand in particular that this explosion of pre-registrations obviously reflects an important aspect of this matter, as he himself said."
"We have had problems because REACH has even been operating too efficiently and has uncovered substances that are actually unknown, which are starting to pop up."
"I would like to ask a question, if I may, which is perhaps premature as it is not possible yet to probably have the relevant data and an assessment of this matter."
"After all, we always thought that the system would more or less include somewhere around 30 000 substances."
"In light of the number of pre-registrations, are you able right now or in the near future to quantify the number of substances which will be entered in the system via pre-registration?"
"The reason for this question is because faced with a significant increase in this number at the moment, this should obviously make us think about how subsequent phases are going to operate."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, I cannot answer the question as to why this enormous difference has come about between the estimates and the actual result."
"I am neither a scientist nor an administrative officer."
"Like you all, I also relied on these estimates being reasonably accurate."
"However, I am not blaming anyone, because it was in fact the case that this could not be known accurately."
"Had we known precisely which substances we deal with daily, REACH would not have been necessary: It is precisely because we did not know this that we needed REACH."
"In this respect, this initial result that we are discussing today is very convincing proof that it was necessary to set this project in motion - I see that Mr Sacconi is nodding - it is shining proof that this legislation, very heavily criticised in public, was indeed necessary after all."
"This initial phase is not about expanding the list of hazardous substances."
"This phase is also not about authorising something or other."
"The initial phase is firstly about knowing what is actually out there, and thus giving companies the opportunity to avail themselves of those manufacturers who have pre-registered the substances when obtaining their supply of those substances."
"The system will, as envisaged in the regulation, develop gradually, and in the course of this process the list of hazardous substances will probably grow longer."
"Naturally, there is the question of which problems will arise for industry with continued use of REACH."
"We will examine this very closely based on analysis of the pre-registrations received."
"However, at present it cannot yet be said what exactly this large number really tells us."
"We need a bit more time for that and I would suggest that I come back either to this House or to the committee to inform you of the result of the analysis and also give you a precise report on the next steps."
"The debate is closed."
"The situation of women in the Balkans (short presentation)"
"The next item is a brief presentation of the report by Mrs Gurmai, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the situation of women in the Balkans."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for staying to listen at this late hour."
"I am very pleased to be able to present this motion to you today."
"I am pleased, because it shows that the European Parliament considers monitoring and improving the situation of women in the Balkans to be important."
"I am convinced that this is our common interest and responsibility, since the European Union cannot close itself off."
"We all know that the countries of the region have been through serious traumas, and not that long ago."
"They are making very great efforts to address their problems, and for this they deserve admiration."
"It is my opinion, however, that they fail to take a very important resource into due consideration, namely women."
"It is true that women suffered particularly heavily during the wars, but we must bear in mind that they are not solely victims, but play a constructive, active, useful and indispensable part in democratic stabilisation and reconstruction."
"I was never in favour of making exceptions for women, but I am so bold as to declare that they should be given the same opportunities as men."
"No more and no less."
"It is no different in this case either."
"Women can fulfil the above-mentioned role only if they are given the opportunity to do so."
"And what is this opportunity?"
"Since women constitute half the population, they must be given a decision-making role in the same proportion."
"I know that according to many people, a quota is not the true solution, but I must say that unfortunately a more effective administrative solution has not yet been found."
"The economic emancipation of women is one of the first tasks."
"Working women are more productive members of society and are less subjugated."
"And if they are working, we cannot allow them to be excluded from leadership positions in economic life."
"At the same time, hard-working women must be given the opportunity to balance professional life with family commitments."
"For this to happen, the attitude of society must become more positive with regard to women, and negative stereotypes must be abolished."
"Education and the media play a key role in this regard."
"I could continue down this long list, but in the interest of time I would like to emphasise two very important considerations."
"First, we can never forget that the region in question is made up of several different countries, and these cannot be lumped together and treated in the same way."
"Every country is working hard in every sphere, and thus also on improving the situation of women."
"Of course some countries are further ahead in this struggle than others."
"I have tried to convey this in the table appended to the report."
"Secondly, the possibility of future entry into the European Union is a significant motivation for these countries to achieve their objectives."
"It is important for them and for us to take advantage of this period in this regard as well."
"My aim with this report was to indicate that they are on the right track, that I pay tribute to their efforts, and that I wish them courage for what lies ahead."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks for the enormous help I have received in the course of this task from Rudolfs Verdins and Elvy Svennerstål of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality Secretariat, from Effy Tsonos and Majella McCone of the Secretariat of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, from my fellow Members the shadow rapporteurs Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou, Doris Pack, Edit Bauer, Lívia Járóka, Filiz Hyusmenova, Emine Bozkurt, Anni Podimata, Marusya Lyubcheva and many others."
"Special thanks are due to the Secretariat of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and of course the Liberals for their tireless work and unfailing readiness to make concessions."
"Last but not least, I wish to thank my immediate colleagues."
"I am very proud of the fact that the motion which I am introducing here today reflects a wide-ranging compromise, which I believe makes the European Parliament's message a clear, unambiguous and strong one."
"I hope that reading between the lines will make it clear that my aim is to give the report a positive, encouraging tone."
"Thank you for your attention."
"It is also a particular pleasure that Commissioner Verheugen, who was the Enlargement Commissioner at the time we joined the EU, is here with us."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Gurmai, I was responsible for enlargement, but that was four years ago."
"Nonetheless, I still recall some of the knowledge from that time."
"I am really glad to be able to speak about this topic with you this evening."
"I have always had a particular interest in it and I still do today."
"Your report tallies with the findings of the Commission: there are no differences of opinion there."
"It is clearly correct that we regard the issue of women's rights and the equality of men and women as an absolutely indispensable component of the political criteria which are a crucial prerequisite for starting and concluding accession negotiations."
"From my own experience, I can say - and Olli Rehn who now does the work confirms this - that enlargement negotiations, indeed the whole enlargement process, the mere hope that accession negotiations might come about, significantly improve the social situation of disadvantaged groups on a regular basis."
"The governments and the parliaments in the countries concerned know what Europe expects from them."
"In my view, there is no stronger catalyst for rapid social change in candidate countries or in potential candidate countries than the prospect of being able to become a member of the European Union and thus of having to meet certain standards which we in Europe have."
"The reports which you have prepared, your analysis and our analysis describe a really daunting problem."
"Women in the countries which we are discussing today are generally under-represented, both in the employment market and in political life."
"Domestic violence is widespread."
"The situation of women in rural areas is extremely worrying."
"Girls and women from national ethnic minorities - above all, Roma women - suffer, as do disabled women, from particular discrimination, and far too frequently women and girls are unfortunately victims of the trade in human beings."
"It therefore goes without saying for the Commission that, in its cooperation with the candidate countries and potential candidate countries, programmes need to be developed to improve these conditions."
"I need not describe that here in detail."
"There are a large number of programmes which should enable the governments and authorities of the candidate countries to deal with the problem properly."
"However, there are also projects and programmes based on the principle of self-help, which support non-governmental organisations and other social groups."
"I can assure you, Mrs Gurmai, that the Commission will in future continue to do all it can to contribute to the strengthening of women's rights in the Balkan countries."
"That clearly includes - as I already said - support for women's organisations and non-governmental organisations."
"I think that a credible and serious prospect of accession for these countries is the strongest possible stimulus to prompt them to really do what is necessary."
"However, we should not be under any illusions here."
"Everyone here in this room knows that such societal processes take their time."
"If I may return to my own experience again, we cannot content ourselves with the fact that something or other is in the statute book."
"We cannot content ourselves with the fact that wonderful action plans that look great on paper are being prepared."
"I have seen dozens of them, and they by no means mean that anything will really happen."
"The real work, then, is only just starting."
"I am very grateful that the European Parliament is showing such great interest in this work."
"That concludes this item."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 4 December 2008 at 12 noon."
"Written Statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - Social developments in the Balkans in terms of gender equality have unfortunately been notorious for the lack of improvement in this field."
"Even though some of the Balkan countries have been given candidate status for EU membership, the situation of women is becoming increasingly worrisome and hardly improving."
"In order to sustain the relative position of women in the Balkan societies, the EU must become more involved in the slow democratic process which characterises most countries in the region and encourage the fostering of legally binding instruments with regard to women's rights and liberties."
"Furthermore, positive discrimination should also be a concept employed by the governments in the region, in the same manner as in the EU Member States that apply it."
"Nevertheless, in order to recreate a stable post-conflict environment, it is imperative to promote the development of an equal society that protects the position of women while avoiding the re-establishment of the 'patriarchal' institutions that have characterised much of the past."
"The participation of women in the decision-making process is essential to achieving a substantial change in their status in society and will have concrete significance for future improvements."
"in writing. - Equal opportunity for women and men is an important part of the Copenhagen criteria."
"Countries in the Balkans have much work to do in this area."
"Candidate countries should strive to make their antidiscrimination and gender equality laws equal to those of the acquis communautaire."
"Issues that require special attention in the Balkans include: increasing health care, increasing the representation of women in government, protecting women from domestic violence, eliminating sex crimes, and implementing stronger antidiscrimination strategies."
"These problems certainly exist within the EU Member States as well."
"We should constantly be striving for better equality between women and men."
"But candidate states have to pay special attention to rectifying these problems before it is possible for them to join the European Union."
"in writing. - The problems of discrimination that Roma communities face remain unresolved throughout Europe."
"In both old and new Member States, as well as in candidate countries, integration policies are generally weak, sporadic and administered on a case-by-case basis."
"Romani women throughout the Balkans face discrimination not only because of their gender, but also on account of the ethnic group to which they belong."
"Due to their marginalisation from mainstream society, Romani women encounter discrimination which influences their access to healthcare, quality education, housing and employment."
"It is extremely important that candidate and potential candidate countries in the Balkans guarantee the elimination of all forms of discrimination and prejudice against Romani women and introduce an effective and practical anti-discrimination strategy to be implemented at all levels (national and local)."
"It is obvious that the European Union's enlargement process, through the use of its tool the Copenhagen criteria, has the potential to significantly change the situation of the Roma in the Balkans."
"For this reason it is crucial that the European Commission adopts an effective monitoring system in order to measure the real efforts made in minority and women's rights in the Balkans, which will then demonstrate full compliance with the political criteria for accession."
"The report on the situation of women in the Balkans discusses one of the most topical subjects of the moment: the place of women in modern society."
"It sounds a large number of alarm bells concerning the situation of women in the Balkans, at a time when a process of establishing stable democracy is under way."
"This report is not only comprehensive, but also deals with key topics which are generally relevant, such as: women in the labour market, combating stereotypes, women's health, women's involvement in decision-making, violence against women and trafficking in human beings."
"The relevance of these topics is all the more apparent in some states which have undergone major changes over the last 20 years."
"What is concerning is how difficult it is to evaluate the actual situation in these countries."
"Women are discriminated against, whether intentionally or not."
"One example of this is the 'informal' labour market for women."
"This situation is regarded as the norm in some countries."
"An even bigger problem is encountered among women who are directed or 'drift' towards activities which are beneath human dignity, such as prostitution, or who fall prey to those involved in human trafficking."
"Another concern is the fact that many women are also victims of domestic violence."
"In another respect, women need to get involved more in changing attitudes so that they can occupy the place in society they deserve."
"As an MEP from a country in immediate proximity to the Western Balkans, I welcome the progress that has been made by the candidate or potential candidate countries mentioned in the report."
"However, we need specific political measures to eliminate social and economic discrimination and insecurities which persist in the region."
"The conflicts in the region have undermined the image of women in the collective memory."
"They have also led to the appearance and reinforcement of stereotypes according to which women's role in society is greatly reduced, overshadowed by powerful men."
"The starting point for eliminating these stereotypes is at the primary level of education."
"Educational materials in schools should actually promote a positive image of women enjoying equal rights with men."
"It is our duty to support these programmes both politically and financially."
"This means that during the negotiation process the results that are achieved should be monitored closely."
"The EU needs to monitor more closely the situation of women in the Balkans, especially in EU candidate states."
"At the same time, encouragement should be given to granting pre-accession funds to support Balkan states in their fight against human trafficking and prostitution, particularly involving children, as well as to provide adequate healthcare services which any woman can have access to, irrespective of her race, religion or social status."
"Last but not least, these funds could also help to set up shelters and counselling centres for women who are victims of domestic violence."
"I would also like to emphasise the importance of providing support for NGOs fighting for the rights of women in the Balkans, to be undertaken both by governments in the Balkan region and NGOs in EU Member States."
"I call on pressure to be exerted on the governments of Balkan states to urgently adopt measures to combat and prevent human trafficking, prostitution involving minors and child pornography, bearing in mind that the Balkans is both a transit region for and a point of origin of human trafficking."
"We must not overlook either the need for the competent institutions in the Balkans to adopt measures aimed at ensuring equal pay between women and men and educating people against stereotypes."
"Last week we observed the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
"The European Commission underlined the importance of the merciless battle with this pressing problem."
"The European Parliament also needs to call upon Candidate States to take on active measures for the proper application and compliance with the existing legislative framework."
"Because the law cannot only be on paper, it must also be applied in reality in order for the position of women, who are placed under such torment every day and do not even realise that this is not acceptable, to be improved."
"This is why I agree with the researcher that actions must be taken to change the stereotypical ways of thinking in these countries."
"I would like to bring your attention to another fundamental point made in the report."
"According to the region's specifics and especially to the military conflicts which the whole of the Europe was witness to in the past decade, I would like to underline the fact that in the conflict zones, men and women, girls and boys experience war differently."
"It is true that women and children are most often the victims in these conflicts, however women must be given the same opportunities and be given an equal chance in order also to be able to fight, to actively participate in social and political life, to manage and to stabilise society."
"Agenda of the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 8.30 a.m.)"
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"State of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the state of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, today's debate is very important because we are close to reaching agreement on the climate and energy package."
"I would like to thank the Parliament and in particular Mr Turmes, Mrs Niebler, the shadow rapporteurs and the rapporteurs for opinions, for a job very well done."
"We have been impressed by the seriousness and the constructive approach of all involved, which have been essential in enabling us to get very close to an agreement."
"The latest trialogue on the directive finished at 1.30 this morning."
"Very good progress was made and it looks as though very few unresolved issues remain."
"This means that we are close to the goal of adopting framework legislation on renewable energy sources that will make a real difference for security of supply, Europe's competitiveness and also for sustainability."
"Prospects are extremely good that within the next few days we will be able to confirm our agreement to set a 20% share of renewable energy in the Community in 2020."
"We will be able to confirm how this target will be broken down into legally binding targets for Member States that will provide certainty for investments."
"We will be able to agree on flexibility and cooperation mechanisms to enable those Member States to achieve their targets by working together in cost-effective ways."
"We will be able to agree on a 10% target for renewable energy use in transport and on bonuses towards the targets for second-generation biofuels and for renewables used by electric cars."
"We will be able to agree on a world-leading set of sustainability criteria for biofuels used to achieve this target."
"We will be able to agree on a whole range of measures to break down administrative barriers to renewable energy penetration and ensure its access to the electricity and energy networks."
"Two or three years ago we could not have imagined achieving such a goal."
"Really big steps have been taken towards achieving European energy policy objectives."
"I mentioned cooperation mechanisms."
"It seems that the key unresolved issue in the negotiations is whether there should be some kind of review of these mechanisms in 2014."
"The Commission can fully understand Parliament's concerns about such a review, taking into account the fact that one of the fundamental purposes of the directive is to create a clear and certain legal framework for investment."
"At the same time, we are aware that the flexibility mechanism provided for in the directive includes some untested elements."
"We cannot say for sure that every part of their design is quite perfect."
"For that reason we are not opposed as such to a review of the functioning of these mechanisms, but we do not want to question the target."
"However, if it is agreed that such a review should take place, I would stress the need to ensure that it should not in any way call into question the targets in the directive or its level of ambition."
"I am confident that the institutions will be able to find an appropriate solution to this remaining problem."
"Looking at the process as a whole, I am proud - and I believe you should be proud - that the Council and Presidency are working together and have achieved a great deal."
"The directive will enable the whole of the Union to reach the standards that so far have been maintained only by a very limited number of Member States."
"This is good progress."
"It is an important step towards maintaining the EU's pioneering role in the critical task of tackling climate change and leading by example in Copenhagen next year."
"In the context of the recently adopted energy security package, this directive also marks an important step forward in our efforts to improve the security of our energy supply."
"The development of the Renewable Energy Directive has been a stimulating process of work between the institutions, in which the Parliament has played its full role."
"We are nearing the end and it is clear from the consensus that has been achieved that the result will be an excellent one."
"I look forward to this process reaching its fulfilment in the coming days."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak today on this very important issue."
"The package of measures on climate and energy proposed by the Commission is one of the most significant initiatives undertaken by the European Union during the past years."
"With these measures, the European Union will not only meet its environmental goals but at the same time it will make a decisive contribution to the new international agreements to combat climate change."
"Adopting this package of measures on climate and energy is necessary in order for the European Union to maintain its international credibility."
"Today's discussion coincides with the International Convention on Climate, taking place in Poznań, Poland."
"It is therefore inevitable that today's audience includes the European Union as well as the Poznań negotiators and the international community in general."
"The measures will facilitate the European Union's transition to a low carbon emissions economy."
"Furthermore, it will give European industry the opportunity to play a leading international role in clean technologies and will therefore give it a competitive advantage."
"The current economic crisis cannot become a reason for apathy; on the contrary, it is a further incentive for us to take measures on climate change."
"It is in times such as the current financial crisis that we need to make the consumption and production of natural resources and products more cost effective and efficient."
"Moreover, by saving energy and improving our energy supply, we can boost the European Union's energy security by reducing oil and natural gas imports."
"The move to a low carbon emissions economy will encourage innovation, will provide new investment opportunities and will create new green jobs."
"This is the reason why the package of measures on climate change and energy is part of the solution to today's crisis."
"It provides the basis for a new, green deal that will enhance the competitiveness of the European industry at international level."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament, the Presidency and the Council for their excellent cooperation with the Commission both on the package of measures on climate change and energy as well as on relevant proposals for cars and carbon dioxide and the directive on fuel quality."
"There has been significant progress on the various issues that concern us and I am sure that we will reach an agreement at first reading."
"The final agreements must maintain the whole architecture of the Commission proposal and our environmental goals, as well as guarantee fair effort sharing among Member States."
"I would like to comment briefly on the revision of the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme."
"In order to achieve our environmental goals, the ceilings in the emissions trading scheme must guarantee a 21% emission reduction by 2020 in comparison to the 2005 levels."
"This is a key point of the Commission's proposal."
"I would like to say a few words on the issue regarding the risk of carbon dioxide leakage."
"The international agreement on climate change is the most effective way of tackling that danger."
"Any solutions to be agreed upon in the package of measures, need to support the international agreement on the one hand, and need to be workable."
"The discussion regarding this issue between the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and the Commission is still continuing at a fast pace."
"I believe that a satisfactory solution will be found that will totally respect the environmental goals of the Commission proposal."
"Regarding the system for effort sharing among the Member States outside the trading scheme, the Council and the European Parliament have made significant progress on a number of issues."
"One of the main issues in our discussion was to find an appropriate balance between the flexible and effective implementation of our goals."
"The Commission has set the annual limit for the clean development mechanism to 3%, because in that way it achieves a balance between flexibility and emission reduction within the European Union."
"This limit, in conjunction with the ability to trade emissions between Member States, will give countries the opportunity to achieve their goals."
"The Commission believes that the flexibility to achieve the goals of the Member States must go hand in hand with a transparent and effective compliance system."
"This principle has already been successfully applied in the European Union's emission trading scheme."
"Finally, significant progress has also been made on the Commission's proposal to shape the legal framework on carbon capture and storage."
"As far as the CCS funding is concerned, an issue in which Parliament has shown particular interest, discussions are already under way on the use of reserves for companies entering the emission trading scheme."
"This is a positive development towards finding a solution."
"Thank you very much and I await your opinions with interest."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, as you see, Mr Solana is absent."
"However, the main subject of today's debate is that we want a consolidated report on the trialogue."
"As part of the trialogue, the Commission, which has now spoken in detail, has already finished its work, at least in large part for the time being."
"Discussions are being held on key issues between the Council and Parliament."
"This morning a great many Members who are not involved in these discussions as rapporteurs or in any other role would have the opportunity, here in plenary, to hear the state of play and to exchange their views on it - that is also why the Conference of Presidents wanted this debate."
"I have heard that the flight from Paris has just landed."
"Mr Borloo is on his way here."
"I am already of the opinion that we should suspend the debate until Mr Borloo is here, then hear the Council and after that continue our discussions, for I do not want this to be a show event."
"I want to hear the state of play from the Council this morning."
"The Council would like Parliament to negotiate a whole package by the end of December in an extraordinary procedure."
"That is fine but then he should please be here on time to submit his view to Parliament."
"Afterwards we can discuss it."
"Thank you very much, Mr Schulz."
"The order of business states that Mr Borloo and also Mr Dimas and Mr Piebalgs will be taking the floor again after the speeches by the chairmen of the political groups."
"They will also take the floor again at the end of the debate."
"Let me tell you something else, Mr Schulz: the European Parliament does not adapt the agenda of its plenary sessions to suit the agendas of those taking part in them."
"Members who attend the plenary sessions must adapt their agendas to suit Parliament's."
"The next speaker, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party ..."
"(Protests)"
"The matter has been settled, Mr Schulz."
"(Protests)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to raise a point of order, and I therefore ask to be allowed to speak."
"I request that the sitting be suspended until Mr Borloo arrives, not to change the agenda but just to suspend the sitting briefly until Mr Borloo is present."
"This is my request."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have just told you that Parliament does not adapt its agenda to suit the agendas of those who take part."
"The dignity of this House will not permit it, and mutual respect among the institutions advises against it."
"I have therefore listened to your points of order and reached the decision I have just explained to you."
"Mr Borloo will speak after the political groups, and Mr Borloo will speak again at the end of the debate."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, you cannot just take note of these points of order."
"It is the clear will of the people in this Chamber to have Mr Borloo here and to hear what he has to say before the debate, so let us wait."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, remember that the plenary is sovereign."
"In view of this fact, I will put the matter to the vote."
"We shall vote on whether to suspend the plenary sitting of Parliament until Mr Borloo arrives."
"(Parliament accepted the proposal)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.50 a.m. and resumed at 9.05 a.m.)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to offer my apologies, which I hope you will accept, for having misjudged Brussels's traffic."
"I would like to thank you, Mr Piebalgs and Mr Dimas, for allowing us to hold this debate and for your intense collaborative work on the energy and climate change package, on which you embarked after Bali under the Slovenian Presidency, then at the informal Council meeting in St Cloud, in August, and which has continued throughout the five months of this Presidency."
"Our common commitment is to secure an agreement at first reading, based on a timeframe that is compatible with international obligations and the European Parliament elections."
"Basically, during this debate, I want to listen to what you have to say before rejoining the European Environment Council, which is taking place at the same time, all day."
"I will give an account of our discussions and your comments to my colleagues."
"Our work could not be coordinated better, and I am grateful to you for this invitation, which demonstrates our common desire to reach a comprehensive agreement on the energy and climate change package."
"Indeed, we are entering the final straight with the Poznań Conference, which is taking place at this very moment."
"This Conference should pave the way for Copenhagen in December 2009, at a time when the world is still hesitating at a crossroads and the Member States are claiming that they are willing to make a commitment, although not by themselves, to speed up the transformation, provided that it is financed or that they receive support, and to review their methods of production and consumption, provided that competitiveness is not jeopardised."
"The eyes of the world are on Europe this month, December 2008, since the events of the coming days in Europe will be a kind of rehearsal, a foretaste of what will take place during the major global talks."
"I hope so in any case."
"The energy and climate change package is a 'how to' package, a package on a huge, but controlled, energy, economic and technological transition, with a shared modus operandi, range of solidarity mechanisms and method, all within a Union of 27 countries making commitments democratically."
"This is probably the first time in modern history that different economies have tried to change their paradigm simultaneously and together."
"Economic development has never been so interlinked with these energy conditions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the task with which history has entrusted us today."
"When it comes to the energy and climate change package, this is the first economy in the world - 450 million consumers and 15% of greenhouse gas emissions - to attempt to demonstrate that sustainable development is possible on a scale of 27 States, notwithstanding such varied industrial, climatic, geographical and economic backgrounds."
"For the other continents, this also shows that one of their main partners is already committed; it is the proof that this is possible."
"You are familiar with the three objectives: the famous three times twenty objectives."
"This is what they are traditionally called, even though, for one of the 20% objectives, the figure in question is actually 20 or 30%."
"Therefore, the three times twenty are: a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990, 20% from renewable energy sources and a 20% improvement in energy efficiency."
"The Commission has translated these objectives into five major draft regulations: the ETS Directive or CO2 emissions trading scheme for industry and energy providers, which aims for a 21% reduction in industrial emissions by 2020; the Effort Sharing Directive, which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in non-ETS sectors such as construction, transport and agriculture by 2020; the directive on renewable energy sources, whose aim is to increase the share of these energy sources from a little over 8% in 2006 to 20%, with a 10% reduction in the transport sector; the directive on carbon capture and storage, which aims to set out the conditions for storing carbon; and, lastly, the legislation on CO2 emissions from motor vehicles, which seeks to bring CO2 emissions down from 160 to 120 grams, between 2006 and 2008."
"Before looking in detail at the negotiations which are, by nature, fluid, I would like to make four general remarks."
"Firstly, this package, which is complex, constitutes a consistent, independent and fair whole, where everyone can find their place and contribute according to their industrial, energy or geographical characteristics."
"Allow me to thank the Commission and the previous presidencies for these eminently collective efforts."
"Our objective is clear: a package of this size would normally have taken several years."
"Owing to the global calendar - the European Parliament's electoral timetable and the meetings in Poznań and Copenhagen - all parties wanted to try to arrive at an agreement by the end of the year."
"This is clearly a very difficult task, but there is no escaping it."
"This objective, which was laid down at the European Council under the German Presidency, was reiterated in October, under Mr Sarkozy's Presidency, even though certain States, in the face of the crisis, expressed their concerns and wanted to postpone any decision."
"There is no question that things were tense, and Mr Sarkozy had to make a very strong commitment so that we could continue to make progress in this field."
"The agreement reached in October therefore confirmed what we achieved under the German Presidency."
"First of all, you wished to bring forward your vote to today or yesterday."
"This reaction, this wish, provided a considerable boost, a considerable push, at a time when concerns were focused on this climate, and this had a very positive effect."
"You - the group chairmen, rapporteurs and committee chairmen - wanted to meet us and Mr Jouyet, and we all discussed what the best possible conditions were to attempt to reach an agreement by the end of the year."
"I believe that we all, and I should like to thank you for this, recommended holding this in-depth debate today, and postponing until this afternoon the conclusions of these debates at the Council, the Council of 11-12 December, a trialogue during the following weekend and then a debate with, I hope, a vote on 17 December."
"I must say to you, ladies and gentlemen, that this will perhaps go down in history as a turning point on the road towards the agreement, which remains our common goal."
"We have entered a crucial phase of talks."
"There is no political posturing or politicking by the Member States where this matter is concerned."
"We are not in a negotiation where, as sometimes happens, a stance or position is taken up in order to gain a particular advantage."
"We are in a kind of positive paradox."
"We are aware that we have to take action because this is a vital issue, but that we have to do it in such a way that each directive is socially, financially and economically acceptable to the Union as a whole and to each Member State individually."
"Today, the negotiations have reached a critical stage."
"The trialogues are going as well as could be hoped; indeed, it is the high quality of the trialogues and the trust between the parties that has enabled the timetable to be modified slightly."
"We do not have long left to reach a conclusion: less than two weeks, in fact."
"The trialogues, some of which were still taking place late last night, should enable us to finalise 90% of the text, which can then be translated into all of the Union's languages."
"Looking ahead to the Council of 11-12 December, the Council of Environment Ministers, today, and the Council of Energy Ministers, on Monday 8 December, will tackle the issues on which an agreement between the Member States still seems possible."
"This afternoon the Presidency will try to make further progress on many points concerning the four texts that comprise, in the strictest sense of the word, this package."
"I shall also present your agreement on the proposal for a regulation on the CO2 emissions of light-duty vehicles and fuel quality."
"I shall then propose adoption of the Council's conclusions on the Commission's communication on deforestation."
"Combating deforestation and forest degradation, as well as the sustainable conservation and management of forests, are key elements of a future international climate change agreement."
"These elements are the subject of much debate with our friends in Africa."
"Moreover, we have, I hope, arrived at unanimous conclusions on genetically modified organisms."
"A final trialogue will be held at the weekend, between the end of the Council of 11 December and 17 December."
"It will, of course, be scheduled to allow us to prepare for the debates and the vote in plenary on 16-17 December."
"The previous trialogues, the last of which took place yesterday evening, have gone tremendously well from a technical point of view."
"To be honest, a few months ago the dossier appeared technically insurmountable."
"I must say that all parties, and the permanent representatives, COREPER, were equal to the challenge and did a splendid job."
"Obviously, I would also like to thank Parliament's representatives at the various meetings and, in particular, at the trialogues."
"Good progress has been made, and the texts have come along very well where the vast majority of points are concerned."
"In particular, the overall architecture and the national targets assigned to each Member State have now secured broad support."
"Several difficult issues are, however, still being discussed within the Council, and between the Council and Parliament."
"It is clear that we must find, within the framework of the ETS Directive - which is probably the most difficult directive - systems for progressivity and financial solidarity that ensure that countries whose economies rely most on carbon can make the transition to other sources of energy."
"The energy performance of industry varies, across Europe, from one to three, depending on the country."
"Carbon emissions vary from one to four, or even five in certain sectors."
"This gives you an idea of the difficulty facing us, but we must reach an agreement where Europe's economic and industrial competitiveness is maintained."
"Moreover, we have been in constant contact with European industries."
"Yes, electricity auctions must be organised, but we have to find a method of regulation that does not entail huge price increases for final consumers, be they domestic or industrial."
"We are currently mapping the route towards this transition without also creating a risk of unfair competition in the internal market."
"With regard to the risks of carbon leakage, we are working on two alternatives, which are not mutually exclusive: progressivity of auctions; and a carbon inclusion mechanism such as the one planned by the United States within the framework of their own package."
"The argument that this would jeopardise freedom of trade is not relevant, in our view."
"In any case, the choice of mechanisms must simply be decided on at a later stage."
"For the time being, we basically need to establish what is appropriate for sectors that are particularly vulnerable due to their exposure to potentially very high additional costs in terms of competitiveness and to risks of carbon leakage."
"Some people, such as our German friends, want to retain only one criterion and to abandon progressivity."
"We need to find a solution that is acceptable to us all."
"In short, at this stage in negotiations, three major blocs have emerged."
"The first is mainly composed of the Baltic countries, which are bound, under the terms of the Treaty - one of them, at least - to dismantle nuclear power stations, and which, owing to their particular geographical location, form a veritable energy island."
"These countries are legitimately highlighting a number of specific technical, practical and financial issues."
"The second bloc comprises countries whose industry is much less efficient in energy terms, as it relies heavily on carbon."
"The most obvious example is Poland."
"It falls to us to find, for these countries, progressivity systems that do not, under any circumstances, alter the global targets or the final deadline, namely 2020, but that are still acceptable to the other countries."
"Progressivity of the system should be prioritised in these cases."
"Lastly, the countries of the third bloc, although they have no major concerns or concerns of such importance within the context of this process, are paying a great deal of attention to the cost of our required solidarity and to the use of revenues arising from the various auctions and, in particular, to the choice or otherwise of post-allocation."
"In two days' time - on 6 December - a meeting is scheduled to take place in Gdansk between Mr Sarkozy and the Heads of State or Government of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and the Baltic countries, as well as Romania and Bulgaria."
"I am convinced that they will manage to find ways to reach an agreement on the topics that they rightly consider to be essential."
"At the end of the process of this first stage, before Parliament meets again, there will inevitably be a strong commitment by the Heads of State or Government."
"Indeed, this package cannot work without the strong, unanimous commitment of the Member States."
"That much was clear from the outset."
"We cannot propose a change such as this to the economic and social foundations of the lives of 450 million European citizens without having an extremely powerful political process."
"There is inevitably a strong temptation within all national parliaments, and perhaps even for some of you here, to balk at the challenge, to think: 'What is the point?"
"That means, however, failing to understand that what we do not do today will cost us dearly in the future in terms of productivity and competitiveness."
"If we do not act today in conditions that our economies and democracies are still perfectly equipped to withstand, we will be faced with an irreversible, intolerable situation, and any progress will subsequently become impossible."
"We will have failed in the eyes of countries that need us to succeed for them to have faith in development."
"We will have failed in the eyes of countries that need us to succeed for them to have faith in their sustainable development."
"We will have failed in the eyes of our children."
"In any case, how could we meet our African counterparts, with whom we have arrived at a common Europe-Africa platform, as confirmed in Addis Ababa a few days ago, then go to Copenhagen and talk of changing the global paradigm, if Europe, which, whether we like it or not, is a white knight in this affair, as it was in Bali, does not adopt this package?"
"I do not see how an agreement in Copenhagen would be possible without this essential prerequisite."
"If, on the other hand, our 27 countries which, admittedly, still have substantial disparities in terms of wealth and a priori different industrial and energy backgrounds, and different climates too, manage to agree on a public process that can be assessed, verified and financed, thereby setting in motion an historic change in trends, then I believe that this will fill us with hope for Copenhagen and for the future of our planet."
"We are convinced that codecision, which is, by nature, an extraordinary opportunity - since I do not believe that one of the components of democracy on its own could make progress within this framework - remains a vital rule for such a major change."
"If I may say so, this is why we shall obviously make the best possible use of all the debates and opinions that we shall hear this morning, and even early this afternoon, and I hope that this codecision procedure will enable us to take this major step, a step which, I might add, European citizens are anxious to see."
"It is a responsible step and a step towards hope."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Borloo, Mr Piebalgs, Mr Dimas, ladies and gentlemen."
"This morning, our debate was devoted to what is now commonly called the 'energy and climate change package', a political package containing a key objective set by the leaders of the 27 countries in March 2007."
"There are numerous links between these five texts, which is why they must be tackled as a coherent political whole."
"The simultaneous consideration of these texts is a challenge and constitutes a heavy workload for each of our institutions."
"I should like to thank all of the parties concerned, and the Presidency and Mr Borloo's team, in particular, for their efforts."
"This work was difficult even before the financial crisis exploded."
"It is extremely difficult now, owing to the economic and social tensions that are causing citizens great anxiety in their everyday lives."
"And yet, in these difficult and serious circumstances, we must avoid failure."
"It is our duty to allow ourselves every chance of success."
"However, this is not a question of imposing our will but of being persuasive and making the necessary efforts to ensure that balanced, forward-looking decisions can be made."
"We must seize this historic opportunity to reverse the climate change trend."
"We must take the path that will save us from heading straight for disaster."
"Combating climate change and promoting eco-innovations also means, in the medium term, kick-starting Europe's economy and industry."
"It also means planning our investments, today, in order to safeguard jobs, tomorrow, and that is why we must secure the support of the citizens."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has been working relentlessly on the energy and climate change package, in the firm belief that it is an essential structural policy and also, above all, with the sentiment that it is an historic policy, and thus a huge responsibility towards future generations."
"Agreement on one of the five proposals, the regulation on the CO2 emissions of cars, was reached this week."
"For our group, for the centre-right, this sends out a strong political message and is an incentive to continue our work."
"Nevertheless, it is the balance of the package as a whole which is at stake and on which we shall be voting during a future plenary session."
"Our task is to listen to one another and to make the efforts required to create the conditions for a compromise."
"Above all, however, our task is to reassure the citizens about their future and to secure their support regarding Europe's strategic options in the medium term."
"I feel able to say that, with this prevailing climate of goodwill, we are giving ourselves the chance to succeed at the vital meetings in Poznań, in a few days' time, and in Copenhagen, next year."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, it is not my job to go into the details of the legislation we are discussing."
"I will try to describe a larger framework for our Group in which we must arrange this climate change package."
"I am pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council has arrived, enabling me to listen carefully to his speech."
"Climate change, as he so rightly said, is a major challenge for us all: for the Council of Heads of State or Government, for the European Parliament and for the Commission."
"We have heard many great titles, 20% - 20% - 20%."
"Only the rigorous work on the details of the matter takes place here in this Parliament."
"The headings are produced by the Heads of State or Government."
"The rigorous work on the details takes place here in the European Parliament."
"Joseph Daul rightly said that we have an initial agreement in connection with the Car Emissions Directive."
"Praise for this success is due to Parliament."
"Therefore, the heading for this legislative procedure which we have brought to an initial agreement should not read Sarkozy but Sacconi."
"(Applause)"
"I will therefore stay with this procedure which has reached an agreement."
"That is not the normal procedure."
"The European Parliament has agreed to take an unusual path together with the Council and the Commission."
"Concluding an informal trialogue and then voting on it is fine."
"However, what we are doing here is to rescind normal parliamentary procedure in the case of six different legislative procedures."
"This means that a great many Members of this House cannot participate in the detailed consultations but must restrict their entire parliamentary involvement to being able to say Yes or No at the end in a kind of ratification of the result obtained."
"That is a serious relinquishment of parliamentary rights."
"I am a little astonished that those who are otherwise always talking about transparency and participation are overlooking this circumstance with a cool smile."
"Nonetheless, in particular situations a decision must be taken as to whether it is justified in relation to the challenge being faced."
"Our Group has discussed this in depth."
"We have agreed that the challenge is so great that this time this path must be taken."
"President-in-Office of the Council, you have rightly said, and this is our firm conviction as well, that this is a challenge of the century."
"We will not solve all the climatic challenges of this century now."
"However, if we do not solve the challenges which we now face, we will founder in the course of this century."
"This is the essential reason for us saying that we want to bring this procedure to a conclusion now."
"I do not think it was the wisest decision of the Council to take and reserve the right to make the final decision at the level of the Heads of State or Government, for the principle of unanimity prevails in the European Council of the Heads of State or Government."
"You have already indicated that President Sarkozy still has to hold separate talks with eight to nine States."
"Good luck!"
"We hope the outcome is successful."
"However, Parliament has not issued a blank cheque with the procedure that we have used here."
"It does not mean that this Parliament is ultimately prepared to accept any particular wish of any individual Member State, which has still to be worked out behind closed doors."
"In an informal trialogue everything must accord at the end."
"The unified position of the Council, the unified position of Parliament and the unified position of the Commission."
"It must not be possible for us to go into the details here only for the European Council to say, well, I still have something to fix here and I still have something to request there, and then for Parliament finally to be told: take it or leave it!"
"That definitely cannot be so."
"This is why I recommend to Mr Borloo and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Sarkozy: come up with a result that is acceptable to everyone."
"Therefore there should be no blocking in the European Council, nor in the separate talks."
"We have made all the arrangements to enable us to vote the week after next."
"The European Parliament has agreed to give this package its blessing this year, if that is possible."
"That will be a major triumph for Mr Sarkozy, he believes."
"I therefore say here and now that if there is a successful outcome, that success is above all due to the hard work of the Members of the European Parliament."
"We can be proud, and if it turns out well, the Presidency of the Council can be too."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr Borloo, we were told that you had come from Paris by plane."
"If this is the case, next time, take the train."
"This would ensure that you arrive here on time and would preserve your green reputation."
"Mr President, the Union might be days away from an historic breakthrough in combating climate change."
"Our national leaders like to talk in shades of green, but now we are going to see the colour of their money."
"In March of last year they agreed to a 20% cut in carbon emissions by 2020 and now we hear the shuffling of cold feet in the Council."
"Our job is to turn up the heat."
"As you have said, Mr President, climate change is the greatest challenge facing us."
"Although there are some who yelp that they cannot afford to cut carbon emissions as they agreed, it is irresponsible of Italy to claim that it would push up power bills by 17.5%."
"Renewable energy generation will bring down bills, and will save us not only money but lives."
"There are signs of progress on the deal."
"We are about to embark on a real market-led cap and trade system, one that would be sensitive to the needs of Member States while still achieving its goals, but we need the Council to reaffirm the commitment to 20% renewable energy by 2020; we need the Council to map out the route to accountable and transparent effort-sharing in those areas not covered by the emissions trading scheme; and we need the Council to commit to the research that will unleash the potential of green technologies like carbon capture and storage."
"We must act to make sure that a combination of industrial lobbying and national self-interest, which has cost us progress on car emissions, does not blight next week's historic opportunity."
"Europe has a chance to lead the world in the quest to cut carbon emissions, to bring about real change to the benefit of future generations."
"When has so noble a quest been right there within our grasp?"
"The Council must keep its word."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, with President Obama in the US we now have a political leader who shows foresight and courage."
"President Obama is going to put green technologies, renewable energies and efficient cars at the centre of the reconstruction of the US economy."
"It is also a question of the ethical reconstruction of this country which President Bush bankrupted in terms of its economy, peace policy and ethics."
"At the same time that we have this enormous historical opportunity, here in Europe we, who have always been international leaders, we, who have always set the standards for international climate policy, risk our long-term view being restrained by the dirtiest enterprises and their accomplices."
"It would be an historical error and we would lose all diplomatic credibility if this Parliament failed to help make a package for the future out of this package."
"This is about politics, and I am proud that yesterday evening we made progress regarding renewable energies with the Liberals, Social Democrats and, albeit very hesitant, Conservatives."
"One Conservative still stands in my way, and that is Mr Berlusconi."
"This climate package is also about the political future."
"I am glad that with Mr Rasmussen we have a Social Democrat leader who wants progress and green-social policy and not a return to the 1970s like other Social Democrats."
"I am glad that Mr Watson is on a green-Liberal course and the exciting question will be: how are we going to go about conserving nature?"
"Where are the ethics in what is supposed to be the greatest People's Party in Europe?"
"Do we really want to permit Conservatives like Mr Tusk, Mr Berlusconi and Mrs Merkel and their accomplices to prevent Europe from making historic progress for its citizens and the world here in this Parliament?"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new 20/20/20 formula used to sum up Europe's targets to combat climate change, is an ambitious commitment which would make Europe the undeniable leader in this global battle."
"To be honest, I should highlight the difference between the universal nature of this target and the unilateral approach of Europe's obligations."
"In my opinion, we should be bold enough to admit that this demonstration of our ability could prove to be, at the same time, of no use for the environment and crippling for our industry, if it is not considered in multilateral negotiations."
"Obviously, we all support the aim of protecting the environment, but in order to do this, we have to identify the most effective instruments, which enjoy broad support."
"It is essential that these two conditions be combined, as having one without the other would frustrate all our efforts and could even have irreparable consequences for our industry."
"A cost-benefits analysis is, therefore, fundamental."
"I would stress that an approach of this kind in no way means gauging or questioning the importance of safeguarding the planet;"
"I simply believe that the instruments which comprise the climate and energy package, first and foremost revision of the ETS directive, must be carefully evaluated, including in terms of the economic or bureaucratic burdens on our businesses and the public purse, as well as in terms of the competitiveness of European manufacturing, with special emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This line of reasoning is legitimate, especially at a time when the global economy is hostage to a poor economic climate, calling for a fresh analysis of the philosophy of the package: I am referring to a review of the criteria used to calculate the national targets."
"Above all, it is imperative to take full advantage of the so-called flexibility mechanisms and only then can we hope to remain competitive at global level."
"I will conclude by stressing that, at this time, it is more vital than ever to avoid attempts to exploit divisions between defenders of industry and champions of the environment."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Borloo, Mr Piebalgs, Mr Dimas, some say that the European 20/20/20 directive imposes excessively high costs on the economy of the European Union."
"Among these is the Italian Government, which has estimated almost doubled costs, without, however, backing up its estimates with any convincing evidence."
"Such positions nevertheless underestimate the future price of fossil fuels and disregard the substantial advantages resulting from the rapid diffusion of renewable energies: for example, the security of energy supply, but above all the creation of new jobs, at a time of recession when thousands of workers are being forced out of production processes."
"Greater energy efficiency and the widespread use of renewables are the key to leaving the economic crisis behind."
"Devoting a large part of public funds to bailing out the banks means reintroducing the same economic model, based purely on finance, which led to the crisis we are trying to tackle."
"We cannot deal with the economic situation without changing our strategy."
"The EU directive focuses on innovation and in particular tries to tackle, in time, the upheaval caused by the climate change now underway."
"This is a problem set to weigh ever heavier on the lives of European citizens and the economies of the Member States."
"This is why public investment must not be used, once again, to sustain traditional sectors, but must concentrate on areas which lead to innovation in the fields of energy and the environment."
"The development of distribution networks and priority access to them are key factors for the growth of the renewable energy sector."
"Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the huge expenditure on network infrastructure for large-scale centralised systems was provided by major public investments."
"This should also be the case to ensure the future of the renewable energy-based system."
"We therefore need to run renewable energy plants using new technologies."
"This is why we need investment, research and development of technologies."
"We urgently need to adopt this package at first reading during the December plenary session, as expected by Europe's citizens."
"We cannot allow the short-sighted self-interest of certain states and certain economic interests to block this process."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, in recent weeks, we have worked with might and main on the negotiations concerning the climate change and energy package."
"They have taken up a great deal of our time, but are, to my mind, worth every minute of it."
"I should, in particular, like to thank the rapporteurs for the enormous efforts they have made and encourage them to insist on an ambitious agreement in the next two weeks."
"I should equally like to thank the Presidency and the Commission for their relentless efforts during the negotiations."
"Sometimes, I get the impression that the Presidency has great difficulty moving closer to Parliament's opinion in terms of content, which could cause detriment to the ambitions of the climate package."
"I am, however, fully aware of the Presidency's difficult task of reaching a consensus within the Council, certainly now a number of Member States are using the financial crisis to weaken efforts in the areas of climate change and energy."
"This is a lamentable state of affairs."
"If we delay our ambitions, it will cost us far more."
"Now is the time to find solutions."
"I would urge the Presidency to hold onto the promising efforts that were accepted at the European Council in the spring of 2007 and 2008."
"In the light of the climate change conference in Poznań that kicked off this week, and which we will attend along with an EU delegation, it is of paramount importance that we stick to our ambitions."
"As such, in Bali, we promised the rest of the world we would come up with a far-reaching climate change package, and we should not disappoint them."
"If we do, the European Union will lose their trust, which will, in turn, affect progress in the negotiations for a new climate change treaty."
"Man has been entrusted with Planet Earth as its steward."
"It is our duty, where possible, to undo the damage we have caused creation."
"Mr President, we are undoubtedly facing the greatest crisis that I have seen in my lifetime, but the threat is posed not by global warming but by our policy responses to global warming."
"It is certainly true that the earth has warmed slightly and intermittently over the last 150 years, but that change is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term natural climate cycles established over thousands of years."
"We have seen the Holocene Maxima, we have seen the Roman Optimum, we have seen the Medieval Warm Period."
"It now appears we are moving into a new 21st century climate optimum."
"The fact is that the sea level is rising no faster today than it has been for centuries."
"The fact is that total global ice mass is broadly constant."
"The fact is that extreme weather events are no more frequent today than they were a hundred years ago, and that the polar bear, far from being threatened as a species, has in fact shown a dramatic increase in population over the last few decades."
"It is true that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, although a much less important greenhouse gas than water vapour, but the effect of CO2 climate forcing is non-linear."
"It is a law of diminishing returns."
"From the current level of about 380 parts per million in the atmosphere, further CO2 increases will have a trivial effect."
"Meantime our policies will have a devastating economic effect."
"The damage will be vast."
"Our unachievable renewables targets, especially with regard to wind energy, actually threaten to cut off supplies of electricity."
"The policies will fail as Kyoto has failed."
"Even if the West cuts emissions, clearly the emerging markets of China and India will not."
"CO2 levels will keep rising for at least half a century."
"The fact is that 1998 was the hottest year in living memory and for the last ten years the world has become cooler."
"The measures we are debating today represent the greatest collective flight from reality that we have ever seen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have a brief procedural announcement to make."
"As you are aware, Parliament decided to wait for the Council's plane to land before commencing this important debate."
"This means that our timetable has been set back considerably, but we also have the courtesy to fulfil our commitments to our guests."
"As you know, we are expecting the Dalai Lama in this House at 11.30 a.m."
"Obviously, the formal sitting will be held at 11.30 a.m."
"This means that we will certainly not be able to finish the current debate at 11.30 a.m. The final speakers will therefore have to take the floor after the formal sitting, which will also put back voting time."
"Naturally all of this will be displayed on your screens."
"I would now ask the speakers to adhere strictly to their speaking time."
"(DE) Mr President, Some of us still look tired because they were talking until 2 a.m. this morning."
"We want a global agreement, but that naturally requires the involvement of all the major players: China, India and above all the US."
"Without this involvement it will not be possible to combat climate change even if Europe makes the most strenuous efforts."
"Admittedly, we are behind the targets for 2020, but we are not only responsible for the climate, but also for the retention of jobs and for the competitiveness of our economy."
"This is the dilemma in which we find ourselves and I can only say that the proposals from the Commission were not good enough for us to be able to adopt them."
"We are now debating and consulting so intensively because, contrary to public statements, the proposals from the Commission have failed to consider these aspects sufficiently."
"I therefore believe - Mr Schulz is right - that we must observe our participatory rights and cannot issue any blank cheques."
"However, the interim results with the car, for example, where we have found a responsible compromise which does not suit the industry but ensures adequate transitional periods, we can endorse, even if a few Greens protest against it or a unified lobby of different interests tries to disparage this useable compromise."
"With renewable energies it is a question of opening up all the possibilities but also of not ruling out technological innovations from the outset either."
"And with the greatest sticking point, emissions trading, the relocation of jobs must be avoided."
"The regulation must be simple, it must be affordable for consumers and industry, and it must prevent competitive distortions between the Member States."
"That is our aim."
"If it is achieved then we can agree to the package."
"Mr President, firstly I want to thank the French Presidency because it is committed to getting a deal and so are we."
"But, as people have said, it cannot just be any deal."
"I am the PSE Group's shadow for the emissions trading scheme and we want a number of things."
"We want to make sure the bulk of the effort is made in Europe, not by offsetting."
"Offsetting must be subject to strict quality controls; it cannot just be any old projects."
"We want identified funding to tackle climate change mitigation."
"We cannot go into international negotiations with vague promises about the funding for developing countries."
"I now want the Council to move on this issue of earmarking."
"We need some movement there."
"We cannot go naked into the conference chamber."
"We need clear criteria on carbon leakage to give certainty to our businesses and to make sure they are not disadvantaged."
"Mr Borloo, you spoke about special arrangements for some countries in difficulty."
"I think that is acceptable, provided they are time-limited and do not undermine the overall architecture of the project."
"This Group will support those special arrangements if they are in that context."
"A lot of people have talked about leadership this morning, about Europe leading."
"Yesterday some of us met some of the key players from China and the United States, who were going to be in Poznań and will be in Copenhagen."
"To be honest, they are pretty sceptical about Europe leading on climate change and they made it very clear that, if we do not lead, they have their own plans."
"So Europe has to make a choice: either we lead or we dance to other people's tunes."
"You mentioned the economic crisis."
"It was failure to act to regulate financial institutions which has caused this crisis - failure by politicians as well as banks."
"Let us not make that same mistake on climate change."
"If we do, it will be ordinary people who will pay the price for our failure, just as they are paying the price today for failure on the banking crisis."
"Mr President, it is one thing to get agreement from 27 Member States on some noble words and a great deal more difficult to secure support for practical action."
"I think the deal we have just done on cars and CO2 demonstrates that: it is really not the most ambitious measure that we could ever have imagined."
"But if we fail to advance significantly on every front, we can at least look to some technologies where I think more progress can be made."
"You will know that I am speaking here in particular of carbon capture and storage."
"I think the Council really has to appreciate just how much potential this technology has to make a huge difference in abating CO2 emissions into the atmosphere."
"If we are to secure an international agreement, if we are to lock China in - which gets 80% of its electricity from coal - we have got to deal with the problem of big power stations, big fossil-fuel, carbon dioxide-generating power stations."
"The first step is to test and develop the technology."
"We have got to get the demonstration projects up and running."
"So I very much welcome the support that the Presidency and the Commission are now giving to the principle that we should be using some ETS allowances to provide the necessary support funding."
"But the criticism is clear."
"What is on the table from the Council is not enough."
"It will not deliver the pledge made by Heads of Government last year to have up to 12 demonstration projects in operation by 2015."
"This technology can make a huge difference."
"In the next two weeks we have a chance to negotiate a deal to actually put this technology into practice."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again this very basic question poses itself: are environmental protection, climate protection and financial and industrial policy compatible?"
"I have the feeling that we have actually gone backwards in the debate and I am constantly presented with the argument that industry and the economy must be taken into account in difficult times and that it is not possible to make any demands of them because otherwise progress will be halted."
"Mr Langen, who, in your opinion, is responsible for the fact that precisely in the car industry things are not going at all well?"
"And this is the case all over the world."
"There is a sales crisis everywhere."
"In my opinion, it is the result of mismanagement, of the wrong industrial strategies, but definitely not the result of having established forward-looking environmental policy with regard to the car industry."
"(Applause)"
"Where are the efficient cars which the Europeans wanted to be able to launch in bulk on the markets of the future then?"
"Now I read that they would need European research facilities to enable them to make technological progress."
"But companies do have the technology for environmentally friendly cars."
"We must provide the framework so that these environmentally friendly cars can at last be sold too."
"What are we doing?"
"We are once again delaying a regulation which we already deemed sensible in 1995."
"In 1995 it was discussed: 120 grams for 2012!"
"What we are now permitting with this regulation - it beggars belief - is for the average emissions from the new European car fleet to be higher in 2012 than it is today."
"(Protests)"
"Who is lying, Mr Langen, you alone do not decide, but it will be obvious."
"(Applause)"
"I think that in this European Parliament we must in fact decide whether or not we can really change our manner of pursuing economic affairs, which is based on over-consumption, 'excess' and a philosophy of 'ever larger'."
"At the heart of the matter, the financial crisis, the climate crisis and poverty in the world can be explained by our over-consumption and the enormous greed of the industrialised countries."
"If we are unable to change this, Mr Langen, then the future is bleak."
"In this century no one will be able to remember the phase of climate policy or crisis policy in Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union's attempt to adopt this development strategy, which assumes that a drastic reduction of carbon emissions generated by human activity will have a significant impact on cyclical climate change, and the attempt to impose such a strategy on the whole world, is the most utopian idea of our time."
"I will mention several figures which will fully demonstrate the absurdity of this assumption."
"For instance, the International Energy Agency maintains that reducing carbon emissions by 50% will have cost the world approximately USD 45 billion by the year 2050, and that this amount of money will reduce temperatures, and I quote, 'by 0.02 degrees', that is, by less than the statistical error, which can have no effect on the progress of cyclical climate change. At the same time, it will result in a rapid decline in the development of human civilisation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a report, a brief one this time, a few days ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change announced that CO2 emissions have again started to rise faster than was forecast."
"Therefore, we too need to speed up our decisions and ensure they are satisfactory."
"Parliament, as certain fellow Members have pointed out, has worked intelligently, competently, and I would even say passionately, and has already adopted important texts in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"We expect the Commission - and I have no doubts about it as I respect Mr Dimas' work - and the Council, to acknowledge the value of this work."
"We are in codecision, and must therefore meet the deadlines and reach agreement prior to the next session in Strasbourg."
"We must not undermine our commitments, but uphold Parliament's fundamental points, such as effective cuts, the automatic switch from 20 to 30%, the creation of an adaptation fund and technology transfer to third countries."
"Europe must play a decisive role in Poznań, remembering, among other things, that it is in Europe's own interest to secure a post-Kyoto agreement with China and the USA."
"I am deeply saddened, as an Italian, that the government of my country and Confindustria have taken such a reactionary and harmful position, first and foremost for my country."
"To say that the economic crisis makes taking action on the climate impossible is foolish; on the contrary, combating climate change is precisely what our point of reference for a green industrial reconversion must be, and which must lie at the heart of our action during this dramatic crisis."
"The environment is not a problem for the economy, but the key to its solution, along with a different social approach to a crisis resulting precisely from a sick economy that harms the environment and employment."
"(DA) Mr President, it is with great pleasure that I am following the renewed interest in green growth that has followed in the wake of the financial crisis."
"Yet, like all new political phenomena, the new green wave also requires a dose of healthy scepticism."
"You could very well get the idea that this is more about creating an alibi for subsidising outdated heavy industry than about actually wanting to conduct a climate-change policy."
"Indeed, if you were a little cheeky, you could say that it resembles an attempt to re-introduce an old-fashioned protectionist industrial policy, under which the big countries in the EU, whose economies are dependent on the car industry, are to be given permission to grant state aid."
"I am not that cheeky, however!"
"I therefore welcome the new green line and would like to say that what we need is a truly visionary focus."
"We should concentrate on switching Europe's car production over to producing electric cars that can be powered by renewable energy."
"One fifth of all the CO2 emissions in Europe come from the transport sector."
"If we focus our efforts on this area then we will really be able to do something about CO2 emissions and reduce emissions of noise and particulate matter."
"(NL) Mr President, whilst I support the gist of the objectives, particularly as regards the climate change plan, to wit the objective of reducing CO2 emissions and dependence on energy imports from outside the European Union, I am also convinced that more realism is called for in the specific objectives that are being put forward."
"The key standard for determining the share of renewable energy is the Member States' gross domestic product and not the natural potential to produce this renewable energy."
"Flanders, future Member State of the European Union, is put at a disadvantage on this score."
"With its very limited coastline, non-existing potential for storage reservoirs, little sun, few open spaces, and so on, it is a complete mystery how the share of renewable energy could be increased from barely 2% to 13% by 2020."
"As such, the way in which the climate plan is to be fleshed out will be an extremely hard nut to crack for both Flemish industry and Flemish consumers, who will also be faced with higher electricity bills, for example."
"Mr President, I agree with the view that politicians everywhere are afraid of long-term decisions because of short-term effects."
"As David Puttnam said recently in Dublin, the political establishment is by nature conservative and afraid of sudden change at local, regional and national level - and, I would add, also at European level."
"On climate legislation we have no choice."
"As politicians we owe it to our communities, to all communities, to future communities, to stand up and be counted."
"The science is a given."
"We know what we have to do: it is a year since the Commission adopted the Climate and Energy Package, and much work has been done."
"The French Presidency has made it a priority, and together we have been working hard to deliver a good deal by the end of the year; what was a possibility is now becoming a probability."
"Having witnessed first-hand many frustrating COPs in recent years, I have always believed in the need for Europe to drive this process forward, as we did in Bali, and to deliver in time for the COP 15 in Copenhagen."
"But be warned: we will not just 'sign off' on any deal."
"I have made this very clear to the French Presidency, and there is a clear understanding that the European Parliament will not be presented with a fait accompli."
"And Parliament is not leaving it up to the Heads of State and Government to 'sign off'."
"Make no mistake about that."
"Any signing off will be done at a subsequent trialogue between the French Presidency and the European Parliament."
"I would, however, just add - and I would ask Minister Borloo to deliver on this, and make it very clear to President Sarkozy - that a generous percentage of the auction revenues should be earmarked for adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, because legislation without generous financing will not result in a global agreement."
"Make no mistake about that."
"Yes, as we discuss and debate our post-2012 package against a backdrop of serious global economic recession and financial crisis, we will need all the incisive governance, entrepreneurial flair and scientific innovation that we can muster."
"Investment, jobs, salaries, consumption and saving our planet are all synonymous, and we will depend on our ability to switch from carbon-spewing fossil fuels to more sustainable energy sources, and to bring all our colleagues around the world to the UN table with us."
"- (FR) Mr President, it is rare for the European Parliament to deal with subjects that have such a far-reaching impact on the peoples of Europe, and even of the world, as the energy and climate change package does."
"Instead of handling this subject with transparency, however, every effort is being made to secure support for this vitally important package by bypassing Parliament's usual democratic procedures."
"Of course, the competent committees have been able to voice their opinions, but this House has never been able to take up a position, with the result that each Member's democratic right to amend the Commission's proposals is destroyed."
"While enhanced cooperation between the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy was decided on, negotiations took place at an informal trialogue on the basis of the vote held in just one committee."
"Do I really need to point out that this vote does not necessarily reflect the majority view of Parliament?"
"Moreover, the positions adopted by the competent committees as a rule exist only in English, thereby preventing many Members from really understanding the extent of the proposed measures."
"This denial of democracy was justified by Europe's desire to set the rest of the world a good example at the Poznań Conference."
"The fact is, this conference will have pulled down its shutters before the Heads of State or Government arrive at an agreement."
"Mr Borloo is right to stress the need for an agreement at Heads of State or Government level, but we must not dispense with the contribution of Members directly elected by the peoples of Europe."
"Parliament will nevertheless be called upon to endorse the compromises negotiated by the Presidency at the next European Council, thereby reducing the codecision laid down in the Treaties to an exercise in style."
"This is unacceptable."
"I want an agreement, but not any old agreement."
"I want an agreement attained with democratic transparency."
"I hope to see a comprehensive agreement reached in Copenhagen in 2009, but adjustment of the European effort within the framework of this comprehensive agreement cannot take place via comitology, as the Commission proposes and as my fellow Members in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, in particular, want."
"An ambitious climate change policy, Mr President, cannot be decided on behind closed doors and without the citizens' knowledge."
"(SV) Mr President, the period for the climate negotiations - the EU's climate change package - is running out and responsibility for our being ready on time lies with the French Presidency."
"Parliament's position was clear as far back as September."
"We will not accept a watered-down proposal."
"Codecision applies to everybody, including Poland."
"The energy package is also being discussed."
"The energy package is hugely important for transparency and a functioning market."
"However, I wish to take up certain parts of it that deal with trading in emissions rights."
"Firstly, the polluter must pay."
"Therefore we cannot compromise on an auction, and to give everything away free of charge would be absolutely crazy."
"Secondly, if the measures force the businesses to move out of Europe through carbon dioxide leakage, naturally they must be compensated."
"However, a global convention minimises this risk."
"Therefore we must not be too hasty and pinpoint victims before the climate conference in Copenhagen."
"I wish to point out that there are rules on small businesses and combined heat and power that are very important for the industry."
"The money received from climate measures must also be invested in climate measures."
"Consequently, the revenue must be earmarked."
"Poor countries are worried."
"Money is needed for mitigation and aid in these countries; there are 27 of us and 77 of them."
"Finally, I would like to remind our French Members of something General de Gaulle once said, that in politics it is not the intention that counts, but rather the result."
"We now have 24 hours of Parliament and the trialogue on trading in emissions rights in which to act."
"Mr President, I am speaking English for the first time in this plenary because I hope that the French Presidency will listen to me."
"Unfortunately, the present model for effort-sharing proposed by the Council would mean that the European Union would reduce emissions mainly outside the EU through CDM/JI."
"It would mean moving up to 70% of the emission reductions elsewhere, mainly to developing countries."
"This would totally undermine the credibility of our climate policy."
"An absolute red line for Parliament is a 50% limit for offsetting, which would ensure that the majority of our emissions reductions are domestic."
"This 50% limit has always been a cornerstone of the EU climate policy, through the long years of the Kyoto negotiations."
"The high CDM quota proposed by the Council would mean a U-turn in EU climate policy."
"This would give too easy an argument for everybody who wants to diminish and blacken EU climate policy."
"The IPCC says that the industrialised countries should reduce domestic emissions by 25 to 40% and developing countries by between 15 and 30% compared to business as usual."
"We cannot double-count emission reductions."
"If we want to offset the majority of our emission reductions, then de facto we demand more from developing countries than from ourselves."
"It is very hard to see how this would help international negotiations and I really hope that the French Presidency understands this basic point of international climate policy."
"(PL) Mr President, we have now said virtually everything about energy and climate change."
"We know that climate change is happening, but we also know that a much more significant global warming occurred in the past."
"We know that in the natural environment carbon emission occurs largely without human intervention."
"Human contribution to carbon emission is only around 4%."
"The main source of CO2 is the ocean, which contains 50 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere."
"Individual countries do not emit equal quantities of carbon dioxide."
"Large quantities are emitted by developing countries, such as China and India."
"Without reducing their emissions, Europe alone will not be able to solve this problem."
"The problem will not be solved either by imposing restrictions on countries with significant carbon emission levels."
"Economies such as Poland's will continue to rely on energy from coal and on biofuels for a long time to come."
"These sources will remain the main driving forces of their economies."
"The expected 20% reduction of CO2 emissions by the year 2020 on the proposed terms will destroy those economies."
"The plan to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% by the year 2050 would result in the collapse of the energy economy not only in Poland but also in many other countries, and would undoubtedly lead to a total economic disaster."
"We must therefore study the problem in greater depth and take protective action."
"Its solution will certainly not be advanced by bilateral talks between Russia and Germany, excluding other Member States."
"This is an issue which we must discuss together and find a common solution."
"I hope that the Poznań meeting, and the subsequent Copenhagen meeting, will result in an agreement and in a solution which will be beneficial to all."
"(EL) Mr President, the discussions in Poznań, and in Copenhagen a year from now must succeed."
"There is no more room for wishful thinking and other delays."
"Just the day before yesterday, the European Parliament, with an outstanding majority, almost unanimously, voted in favour of the Florenz report, requesting ambitious goals, adequate funds and direct measures, but the corrupt alliance in the Council and the Commission is trying to slice through and undermine this effort."
"It is unacceptable for the Council to undermine the role of Parliament, just to please Mr Berlusconi and a few other new members of the European Union."
"The interests of European citizens and the historical interests of the European Union itself must come first."
"The European Union must continue to lead this effort and avoid undermining the European Parliament's will to contribute."
"(PL) Mr President, the imposition of the drastic solutions contained in the energy and climate change package on European Union states which account for only 15% of global carbon emissions will have a destructive impact not only on Poland, but also on Europe and the world."
"While the old EU states have reduced their carbon emissions by approximately 3%, in Poland, as a result of industrial transformation and the modernisation process, emissions have been reduced by approximately 30%."
"In spite of this, the European Union demands further reductions, which are supposed to represent implementation of solidarity and burden sharing, but which are certain to lead to the collapse of our industry and to a huge rise in costs."
"In addition, we oppose the CCS Directive recently imposed."
"This will make it impossible for Poland to use geothermal energy and to achieve the goal of a 20% share of renewable energy."
"On the contrary, it could become the cause of an environmental disaster, rather than ensuring environmental protection."
"Releasing carbon dioxide from the earth's strata can cause the death of living beings as well as tectonic movements and earthquakes."
"(DE) Mr President, Europe is warming up faster than the global average."
"Within one decade, as you are aware, the injuries caused by natural disasters have doubled to almost 14 billion annually."
"We must therefore consider our next steps carefully."
"This is precisely where we still have problems."
"If we now consider exemptions from emissions trading, it must not be forgotten that energy enterprises have shamelessly charged the consumer for their free certificates in order to generate additional profits for themselves."
"This must not be allowed to happen again."
"We do not need any more ill-considered hasty reactions like the green fuel fiasco either."
"Alleged zero emissions from electric cars are useless if the power comes from coal-fired power stations."
"In my view, however, it is quite ridiculous to extol nuclear energy as environmentally friendly in this situation."
"If the billions that go up in smoke for this on an annual basis were used for renewable energies, maybe we would not have any energy problems at all any more and we would certainly be a major step further forward in terms of CO2 reduction."
"Furthermore, in this connection it must be remembered that in the long term we must encourage the subsidising of public transport and the movement of goods by rail."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"We are all committed to stopping climate change, to preventing the global environmental catastrophe that threatens humanity."
"We know, of course, that this entails serious costs, which we citizens will sooner or later have to pay for one way or another."
"We also know that the later we take action, the greater will be the damage, the more irreversible the processes, and the more we will have to pay."
"The question is whether, on the one hand, we are brave enough to be the first to take action and make the necessary sacrifices, and on the other hand, how we will share the burden among the various social and economic actors."
"The legislative package before us shows that the European Union is committed to action, and it also demonstrates that, unfortunately, it is partisan, inconsistent and uses a double standard when it comes to implementation."
"It allows certain Member States to produce more emissions in 2020 than the Kyoto target set for 2010."
"Meanwhile others, who had already been performing well, are not given adequate incentives."
"Why do we turn a blind eye to the fact that certain Member States do not care a whit about their promises, while others agree to make enormous sacrifices?"
"It is likewise incomprehensible why the cement industry should have to reduce twice as much as the waste industry or transport."
"Minister, the brave government is not one that dares to mete out harsh punishment to companies, but one that is just as severe toward itself."
"The wise government is not one that takes citizens' money abroad under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), but one that invests at home, within the EU, reducing our energy dependency by creating new, marketable, clean technologies."
"The present global economic recession is no reason for failing to take action, but on the contrary, it is an opportunity for a breakthrough."
"Europe's historical responsibility and opportunity also means assuming a pioneering role in this third industrial revolution. Thank you for your attention."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members, starting with my group chairman, Mr Schulz, who rightly highlighted the result attained last Monday with the agreement on the regulation laying down the requirement to reduce CO2 emissions from motor vehicles."
"I would like to explain why, intentionally and in agreement with the French Presidency, which has done a wonderful job - I wanted to say so informally - why, to stay on a car theme, I speeded up the securing of this agreement, putting my foot on the throttle, so to speak."
"This was for two reasons: the first is because I felt it important for the package to move forward, at least on one issue, to show that it really is possible - difficult, but possible - to reconcile different requirements: protection of the environment and combating climate change, on the one hand, and the economic dimension of competitiveness and social issues, as well as employment, on the other."
"We are aware of the extent of the current crisis in the motor industry, and doing this at this point in time sends an extremely important signal."
"However, I put my foot on the throttle for another reason too."
"I thought that it would be much better to conclude this dossier ahead of the European Council next week so that, if I may put it bluntly, no one can put their oar in. No head of state or government will be able to get their hands on the regulation."
"I am addressing my fellow Members who, like Mr Davies, have criticised this agreement, but have not realised that it would also have been better if the other dossiers - such as Mr Davies's dossier, where everything is already in place to reach an agreement - had already been concluded."
"I would like to tell you something, Mr Borloo, if you will allow me one moment longer: we do not always manage to reach unanimity here, so take heart, and do not allow a similar situation to what happened yesterday on renewables, where one country, unfortunately my own, vetoed the proposal, thereby making an agreement impossible."
"(DA) Mr President, it has been fascinating to be involved in negotiating the climate package, first in the committee and then in the trilogue negotiations in which I am taking part in the capacity of shadow rapporteur on the effort-sharing directive."
"Here in Parliament we have shown a great aptitude for reaching compromises and coming up with ideas that could improve the Commission's proposals, for we are well aware that if we are to have a serious successor to the Kyoto Agreement we must be armed with an ambitious proposal when we meet up in Copenhagen."
"It is now the Council we are waiting for."
"I would like to spell out a couple of key problems."
"It is important that the Council should understand that if the Member States want flexibility there must be a guarantee that the targets will be met, which must take the form of reporting coupled with consequences if the targets are not met."
"Empty promises will not put the brakes on global warming."
"It must also be made clear that we cannot just purchase our entire reduction from outside the EU. Instead, the majority of our efforts must be made in Europe."
"Anything else is neither serious nor credible if we actually want to obtain an international climate agreement as such behaviour can be interpreted as giving the message that we have already done our bit and there is no more we can do."
"Similarly, we must not lack the motivation for energy technology modernisation in Europe and we must ensure, through this package, progress towards a future where we base our energy use on forms of energy that are CO2-neutral."
"Last year, the EU's Heads of State or Government pledged to play a leadership role on the climate front - that represents a commitment."
"Parliament is ready."
"The Council must now demonstrate its will to produce results so that we can together take pleasure in the climate package as the best Christmas present this year."
"Mr President, I share the anger and frustration of all those who are rightly criticising people in this Parliament and Council who are trying to destroy our commitments to an ambitious climate and energy package."
"The EU is now calling into question its own 30% commitment, seeking to offset most of what reduction effort it sets itself, whittling away the auctioning demands of the power sector and almost all other industries, putting in place car efficiency standards that are worse than the status quo, and criminally failing to commit funds for solidarity with developing countries."
"All this means that the EU's climate package is looking increasingly empty, and Europe's politicians will not be forgiven for such a monumental failure of political leadership."
"I want to challenge one sentiment that has been repeated several times today."
"We do not have to choose between tackling the economic crisis and tackling the climate crisis."
"We should be using the financial crisis as an opportunity to completely reshape the focus and direction of our economy, to make it a genuinely sustainable economy which will actually deliver environmental and economic benefits."
"This is a critical test for the whole EU project itself, and it is not one we can afford to fail."
"(PL) Mr President, today's discussion concerns energy and environmental protection."
"The impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change is real, although other factors are currently being underestimated."
"I should like to emphasise that action on this matter must have a global dimension."
"Otherwise what will be the result of our drastic restriction of emissions, if other countries do not do likewise?"
"It will simply lead to European goods becoming uncompetitive, and to our markets being dominated by those who have not introduced such restrictions."
"We must also take into account the situation of countries such as Poland, whose power generation industry is largely based on coal."
"It would be appropriate to recognise the huge progress in reducing carbon emissions recently achieved by those countries."
"The energy and climate change package must therefore be sensible and at the same time imbued with the spirit of solidarity."
"It should also be innovative, and supportive of the economy and the environment, whilst ensuring security and looking to the future, which is especially important at this time of major economic downturn."
"(SV) Mr President, in March 2007 the EU's Heads of Government promised that the EU would reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020."
"This commitment is not in itself sufficient to stop the warming at the magic limit of 2ºC, as research tells us is required."
"Nonetheless, it was a promise to our citizens and a step in the right direction."
"It is therefore with great concern that I now see the tool for achieving this aim, the climate change package, becoming more and more impotent with each day that passes."
"Last Monday an informal agreement was reached between the French Presidency and Parliament's large groups on how we will reduce carbon emissions from cars."
"The result is extremely easy to sum up: business as usual for the car industry."
"Absolutely incomprehensible!"
"As far back as 1995 the Commission proposed that carbon emissions be limited to 120 g."
"Now, 13 years later, the target has been deferred again."
"This is a result of all the loopholes in the legislation in the form of the phase-in of both the number of cars that must meet the requirements and ineffective financial penalties."
"I am also tired of hearing the financial crisis being used as an excuse for not taking responsibility for climate impact."
"The car industry has had more than a decade in which to switch to greener technology."
"This is not a result of the financial crisis; rather it is the result of ongoing overproduction and the failure of the car industry to make changes."
"The negotiations on emissions trading are also in their final stages."
"They do not look good for the climate either."
"The CDM projects are a case in point."
"Of course we must support climate projects in developing countries, but this must be in addition to our own emissions reductions and must not replace them."
"(PL) Mr President, under the guise of noble environmental protection objectives, the richest states and companies are forcing through a climate change package which will hit the less well-off European Union states."
"In the context of a world crisis, mining and power generation in countries including Poland are being attacked, at the expense of inhibiting economic growth and causing mass redundancies."
"I too support reducing carbon emissions in Europe and in the world, but not at any price."
"We cannot close coal-fired power stations or coal mines overnight."
"It is not too late to work out a wise compromise acceptable to all states."
"But such a compromise will become possible only if the special features of national economies are taken into account."
"Otherwise we will be facing a situation of diktat and injustice, and we should not consent to that."
"(DE) Mr President, carbon capture and storage is only one small cog in the overall climate package."
"But little cogs and little wheels have their significance too. That is why it is so important that we and the European Union clear the way for the construction and establishment of demonstration projects, because a whole new industry, a transitional technology for storing CO2 can be developed without minimising major efforts elsewhere."
"There are three major demonstration projects in the world which have other targets, that is to say, to accelerate oil and gas production."
"However, we need our European demonstration plants because we are responsible for mines, for technology, but also for the regulatory framework for the time after the closure of mines, which we must then set in motion in Europe."
"We have problems with financing, at least that is what is said."
"I do not believe these should be genuine problems."
"We put - and the figure stands - EUR 1 800 billion into the financial umbrella for companies and banks and for injection into businesses."
"1 800 billion - and we do not have 10 billion or 5 billion to try out new technologies which might be of worldwide significance."
"I have just come back from China."
"Here we talked about CCS technology, with China producing 60% of its energy from coal in future."
"South Africa, America, USA and Russia all need these technologies, and in Europe we fail to get these technologies off the ground."
"I think that we and the Council should make an effort to get funds via whichever instrument we can, be it ETS or others, so that we can blaze a global trail in precisely this technology."
"(PL) Mr President, the problem of climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity."
"The European Union has developed an ambitious programme of reducing carbon emissions by 20% by the year 2020, improving energy efficiency and increasing the share of energy from renewable sources."
"These plans demonstrate that the Union wants to lead the world in combating climate change, but the European Union is not an island, and cannot act alone."
"If we do not convince our partners around the world to make equally ambitious adjustments, we will not be able to deal with the problem in spite of our best efforts."
"The proposed changes must be designed in the most efficient way, so as to minimise what will in any case be huge costs for the economy, and thus reduce the burden on the individual."
"In assessing the Commission's proposal within this framework, I wish to point out two dangers."
"First, the need for facilities producing energy to buy carbon emission permits at auction will lead to a significant rise in energy prices, especially in countries where coal plays a major role in power generation."
"This will have an adverse impact on household finances and on business competitiveness in those countries."
"The problem can be partially solved by benchmarking."
"This method rewards the most efficient solutions in their fuel category and thus allows the goal of carbon reduction to be achieved at a considerably lower cost."
"Second, the currently proposed rights allocation system for emission strongly favours industries at risk of carbon leakage at the expense of heat and power generators."
"In fact, it puts richer countries in a privileged position, which does not seem to be a fair solution."
"The allocation system should be designed so as to ensure that less well-off countries do not lose out to the others."
"The fairest system would seem to be one allocating auction revenue on the basis of Gross Domestic Product."
"I call on the Commission and the Council to find a wise compromise, so that striving to achieve these goals does not undermine the competitiveness of our economies and cause living standards to deteriorate."
"Mr President, thanks to the determination of the rapporteur, we have made huge progress in the negotiations on renewable energy."
"It was disappointing not to reach complete agreement last night, but the one clause at issue is not just about keeping inviolate the 20% by 2020 target: MEPs have worked long and hard to ensure that there is legal certainty in the flexibility mechanisms which Member States can use to help them achieve their renewables targets."
"A review of the flexibility mechanisms in 2014 risks undoing all that good work."
"It risks undermining the large-scale development of renewables and green-collar jobs which promise a renaissance for European regions like mine, North-East England."
"That is why we cannot give in on wording which is being insisted on by just one Member State."
"But much positive progress has been made on the Renewables Directive."
"We have achieved a strong text on biofuels and, crucially, indirect land-use change will now be factored in at the insistence of the Parliament."
"I am also pleased that Member States will be required to push energy efficiency in order to achieve their renewables targets more easily."
"At this point we must keep our nerve on the Renewables Directive - as indeed on the entire climate package."
"This legislation must work well for the EU, but it must also work as a strong offer on the table of the global negotiations."
"- (FR) Mr President, Europe has been a pioneer before, and it wants to continue to act as a bridgehead in Copenhagen."
"Of course the world is watching, observing us today, but its gaze is also focused on the Obama Administration."
"And we are right to wonder whether he is doing a better job, since we are still falling short in this area."
"We are falling short when it comes to polluters and, ultimately, leaving negotiation of the energy and climate change package to the Member States."
"Personally, I have lost all faith."
"We have been sounding the alarm to no avail for a long time."
"Across the Atlantic, the world's largest emitter has announced that, by 2020, it will cut emissions back to 1990 levels, in other words, a 60% reduction in its emissions."
"Furthermore, it wants directly to auction 100% of the allowances."
"I ask you: where is the fault in this?"
"Of course, we pat ourselves on the back for our considerable efforts, even though we know for a fact that we fall far short of what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientists are demanding."
"In the US, trade unions have backed the transformation to a low-carbon economy."
"This really should inspire our manufacturers, who are preoccupied with using the environmental, financial and economic crises to make staff redundant, after years of making profits that were not redistributed to employees and after years of negotiating voluntary agreements on pollution, which were just as much of a failure."
"(PL) Mr President, major climate changes are influenced by heat emission from the sun, which provides our planet with approximately 96% of its heat."
"Excessive CO2 and methane emission has an adverse impact on the environment and must therefore be reduced."
"A way out of this impasse is to implement radical technical and organisational measures to accelerate the development of power generation from renewable sources, increase the generation of clean energy and speed up all actions enhancing energy efficiency and energy saving."
"This will undoubtedly require restructuring expenditure and ensuring mobility of the funds allocated to such measures, but it must not result in a drastic increase of electricity prices."
"This would not be acceptable to European society or European industry."
"For this reason, the present version of the package requires major reworking."
"Mr President, I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to today's debate."
"I was principally involved on behalf of the PPE-DE Group in Mr Sacconi's report on car CO2 emissions, and took part in the trialogue, and I would like to pay tribute to his work in helping to secure an agreement on this legislation."
"I can report that the PPE-DE Group last night agreed that we would support the draft agreement in the plenary vote."
"That legislation has now been agreed and it ensures that we can encourage the vehicle manufacturers to move towards producing cleaner, greener and more efficient cars, but hopefully doing so in a sustainable way that will not cost jobs and prosperity in the industry."
"Like Mrs Hall, I too represent the north-east of England, and my region has very many thousands of jobs dependent on the car manufacturing industry;"
"I hope that none of those will be affected by this legislation."
"Let me say a word about the process."
"I have been particularly concerned that, during the progress of this legislation, it is being speeded through both the Council and Parliament with sometimes undue haste."
"Many times we were faced with receiving the 60-page documentation only an hour before the actual formal trialogues took place."
"Even before the final trialogue on Monday the Commission was still tabling technical adjustments to the wording a matter of minutes before the actual negotiations took place."
"I do not believe that this is a good way to proceed."
"I think it is bad that there has not been proper scrutiny of this very important legislation either in the Council or in Parliament."
"I understand that is also the case with some of the other dossiers."
"I really believe that it is important that all of this legislation is scrutinised properly and that everybody has the chance to contribute to the debate."
"We must make sure that we get this very important legislation right and that there are no mistakes that we might discover in future."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had the honour of responding to President Barroso's proposed climate package on behalf of the Group."
"At the time I said that I supported the environmental policy targets wholeheartedly for my Group."
"And I still do."
"We cannot change our minds on this."
"However, I already referred to the problem of carbon leakage at that time, and it was clear to me then, Commissioners, that the Commission has not done enough work in this field."
"Now there is some catching up to do."
"I thank the Presidency for undoubtedly trying to find solutions together with the parliamentarians."
"This is not about abandoning the targets, it is about giving those industries which use the latest environmental technologies a suitable initial advantage too, and not about inducing these industries to leave the European Union along with their jobs and environmental pollution."
"The benchmark system, which has already been mentioned, must also be put into an appropriate form."
"It is also a question of enabling reliable planning."
"There is little point in establishing the principle now but then postponing its implementation for years until the Commission has worked out the details."
"Companies need reliable planning so that they can also invest now."
"A last very important point: the revenue from the increases should actually be reused for environmental targets, either in our industry itself, so that it can modernise itself to be able to meet the environmental challenges, or even outside the European Union."
"I do not think the Ministers of Finance should be allowed to disappear with this money."
"It must be used for environmental protection."
"(DE) Mr President, the environmental policy of the EU is facing a reality check."
"Economic performance in Europe is collapsing, and here we are considering how we can set up additional hurdles for our industry."
"Emissions trading is supposed to reduce emissions, but first and foremost it will increase costs."
"This increases the danger that jobs will be exported."
"Meanwhile the rest of the world is calmly watching us."
"China really only has to bide its time, then steel will be produced there and no longer in Europe."
"It is not for nothing that 11 000 steelworkers demonstrated in Brussels this week to keep their jobs."
"I welcome very much what Mr Swoboda has just said about the benchmark system, but the insight of the Social Democrats was very late in coming."
"I am convinced that we enormously overestimate our importance if we believe we can significantly influence the global climate by means of political measures."
"In the 21st century those societies which answer two questions intelligently will be successful: Where does our energy come from and how do we employ it efficiently?"
"A policy of particularly expensive and ideological CO2 avoidance, like that we are currently operating in Europe, will not lead to success."
"(DE) Mr President, honourable President-in-Office of the Council, honourable Commissioners, fellow Members, I think the climate protection package is on track."
"Today I should just like to use my two minutes of speaking time to discuss the topic of emissions trading, because it is closest to my heart."
"Permit me to take a look across the big pond at the US in this regard."
"What do the Americans do?"
"Barack Obama has presented his plan 'New Energy for America'."
"When one reads it, one is delighted because the targets formulated in it are the same as ours."
"Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, increasing the proportion of renewable energies, reducing energy consumption, reducing oil consumption, introducing a million plug-in hybrid vehicles by 2015."
"These are all projects and targets with which we are very familiar and which one can only support."
"However, the big question is: how are the Americans going to do that?"
"That is also where the big difference lies in relation to what we are doing in Europe."
"The Americans are investing heavily in their industry."
"The American Government is setting up an economic recovery programme worth USD 500 to 700 billion, and says that the majority of this money will go into the development of renewable energies and green technology."
"When you look at the details in the Americans' election manifesto, the talk is of billions in support for industry, to really bring industry up to world market level."
"What are we doing?"
"When I look at emissions trading, we are taxing our industry EUR 70 billion per annum."
"EUR 70 billion in additional taxes for our industry."
"I believe that the question of how our domestic industry is to remain competitive, and how we are to prevent our jobs from leaving Europe is justified."
"I only support a regulation in the climate protection package which guarantees that we have no carbon leakage and that our domestic industry is also retained in Europe."
"(Applause)"
"(BG) I would like to note that for me and my colleagues, it is important that an outcome is reached in the talks on climate and energy, so that Europe can be a leader in the talks for an international agreement."
"At the same time, however, I would like to express, with sadness, disappointment that progress has not been made in one of the most important issues for countries of Central and Eastern Europe and that is, for the just recognition of their efforts in the period from the time of the signing of the Kyoto Protocol to the present day in the reduction of emissions."
"I consider that a solution should be found which, within the framework of the compensatory mechanism, will also take into account the efforts made by these countries because, as well as their level of economic development, the issue of restructuring the economy in these countries has been quite topical these past years."
"I'm delighted that Mr. Borloo made mention of the meeting to be held next week which could give progress to this issue."
"It is very important, in relation to electrical energy trade quotas, that this process takes into account the integration of this sector in various countries."
"In some countries there are long-term agreements and therefore the gradual implementation of these quotas, in countries where the market has not sufficiently integrated with the emissions trading system, will be a good solution."
"I applaud the search for a solution on carbon emissions and I consider that the up-to-date information issued by the Commission on this issue will contribute to finding solutions that will protect industry in countries which are in competition with neighbouring countries outside the European Union."
"Mr President, the EU has the potential to be a global leader in the fight against climate change and that is what our citizens are expecting from us."
"Therefore it is crucial to reach a first-reading agreement on the climate change package, not only to meet those expectations but to go to Copenhagen with a unified position."
"I would like to thank my colleagues who have been working long hours to try to achieve this."
"It is important to keep our ambitious targets, but at the same time we cannot ignore the dramatic impact of the financial crisis on the competitiveness of European industry, which has been greatly affected by it."
"Given this new economic context, it is even more important to consider the wide variety of industrial infrastructures in Member States and it should be recognised that some of them have achieved a rapid and large-scale reorganisation and modernisation."
"This is why we need to offer reasonable and appropriate flexibility to Member States and industries to achieve their CO2 emission reduction targets."
"Mr President, while we are discussing reductions for 2020 of 20%, or at best 30%, more and more scientists tell us we have to do much more."
"The reason is the most recent science presented after the IPCC reports, and the message is that climate change is both more rapid and more serious than experts thought only a few years ago."
"The most alarming new information is about the interplay between the climate system, the oceans and the terrestrial eco-systems."
"Oceans and vegetation on land have camouflaged warming by absorbing more than half of man-made emissions so far."
"This sink capacity is now at risk because of global warming, and it is further aggravated by the over-use and destruction of major eco-systems, in particular forests."
"While we can control emissions, we have no control over such positive feedback on the planetary system."
"So our effort, in my opinion, is too small."
"Nevertheless we have to make a decision, hoping we can enhance our efforts step by step in cooperation with the rest of the world."
"With regard to the package, I am concerned that auctioning is being questioned."
"We need auctioning to stimulate innovation and to raise revenues for much-needed support for adaptation and green investments in developing countries."
"I am also concerned about the level of offsets proposed."
"In my opinion we are thus postponing the necessary technology transformation in our part of the world."
"I have been particularly involved in the negotiations on renewables."
"The most difficult area has been the sustainability criteria."
"Here we had a breakthrough last night with the Council on more ambitious greenhouse gas savings when using biofuels, and on including indirect land-use effects in the life-cycle analysis."
"I think that shows responsibility."
"Let me make a final point."
"Climate change is different from all other issues we are discussing."
"We can negotiate the detailed level of budgets, for instance, but we cannot negotiate with nature."
"- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the climate and energy package which we are debating today represents a compromise."
"It is a compromise between the interests of industry, the need to protect the environment and also of course the need for employment and for the protection of jobs in Europe, which is all the more acute in view of the current economic crisis."
"The climate and energy package also represents a compromise between the industrially-developed countries in the European Union and the countries in Europe where industry does not play such a significant role."
"Like all good compromises, this one assumes reasonable concessions from all of the parties."
"I firmly believe that we can reach a compromise which will suit all Member States, old and new, large and small, more industrially-developed and less industrially-developed, whether in the west, east, north, south or centre of Europe."
"At the end of the day, this is borne out by the deal over the proposed regulations for vehicle CO2 emissions and the deal over directives on energy from renewable sources."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union represents in many areas of life a model for other regions of the world."
"This applies also in the areas of energy and climate policy."
"It is in our vital interest to adopt the climate and energy package as quickly as possible and to play a leading role alongside the new American administration next year in Copenhagen."
"(FI) Mr President, better use of renewable energy and promoting sustainable development are positive moves for the regions."
"They will not only have a beneficial impact on climate but will create jobs there and improve access to energy."
"Interregional differences, however, need to be taken into greater consideration."
"For example, the cold climate of the north and the crucial importance of the forest industry need to have greater visibility in the final decisions."
"I would also like to point out that there is a lot of drained bog in the north, where the wood produced and the sustainably exploited peat are extremely important in energy production there."
"I hope that this will also be taken into account when the decisions are being finalised."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the French Presidency on the serious attention it has devoted to the energy and climate change package."
"Above all, I should like to thank the Presidency for listening to comments which were repeatedly made in Parliament, but were not treated with sufficient seriousness."
"Fellow Members, the European Union has been able to manage in the most difficult circumstances."
"Now is also such a difficult moment."
"It is vital that we listen to one another and are open to opposing arguments."
"We have always been able to do that."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to reassure Mr Turmes."
"As far as my own country is concerned, we are fully ready to adopt the package as soon as possible."
"Parliament is well aware of the proposed amendments."
"They do not in any way endanger the principal goal of the package, which is to reduce emissions."
"We most certainly need a climate change package, and we need it as soon as possible."
"No one knows this better than Poland."
"We are responsible for negotiations at the Climate Convention and are aware that without a package we will not be able to make progress in global negotiations."
"What I have in mind is a package which would achieve all the proposed goals, I repeat, all goals up to the year 2020, but which would be easier to accept by our European economy."
"Only a package of this kind can serve as a model for others, and such a package we have in mind."
"Moreover, only a strong economy, free from threats, will be able to invest in climate protection."
"If we weaken the economy, where will the funds for combating climate change come from?"
"This is why this discussion is so important, and why it is important for us to listen to each other's arguments."
"(FI) Mr President, I would like to stress what many here before have already said, which is that now that we are talking about the decisions which are under discussion, we have to remember that will only result in the implementation of the decisions that the Heads of State or Government took back in March, 2007."
"Moreover, the level of aspiration must be that we implement the decisions that have already been taken."
"In that sense, what Commissioner Dimas said here about the relationship between flexibility and effective implementation is extremely important."
"We need action within the European Union and I wish to show my support for the rapporteur, Mrs Satu Hassi, when she says that it is our duty to take decisions within the European Union."
"Only in this way can we guarantee what many of us are speaking about, which is beating the economic crisis by means of eco-innovations and investing in new technology and new development."
"Unless we ensure that these requirements apply to us too, industry will not be motivated to start developing new technology."
"For this reason, I am slightly concerned if we are going to allow some countries special flexibility, as then in the worst-case scenario they will be losing out, which is to say they will not receive the technological benefits that the other EU countries will."
"(BG) The long-term continuity of policies at a national and European level in the use of energy from renewable sources and the long-term continuity of investments are the key factors for the sustained development of the green energy market and for achieving the goals set for 2020 in an economically effective way."
"In order to use the diverse portfolio of green technologies, a diverse range of instruments is necessary."
"Whether this will be in the form of tariff schemes, investment grants and others depends on the level of development and use of alternative sources."
"This should be applied without this damaging competition between various market players in the energy sector."
"Such a complex strategy has the potential to affect upon the reduction of harmful emissions and upon the increase in energy security."
"This is a principle condition for the effective functioning of the economy and for ensuring peace of mind for our citizens."
"- (FR) Mr Borloo, Mr Piebalgs, Mr Dimas, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate the French Presidency on the efforts it is making to conclude this climate change package."
"But, there you have it: just as we are discussing the challenge of climate change, what should appear on the negotiating table but the financial crisis."
"It is precisely the economic crisis and the reduction in our raw material resources that should allow a true sustainable industrial revolution."
"I therefore say 'yes' to the three times twenty objective; 'yes' to clean engines; 'yes' to renewable energies with an energy mix; but 'no' to carbon leakage, and 'no' to relocations."
"We therefore need to support research and innovation and to help our businesses and our economy get through this transition period as painlessly as possible."
"The agreement on cars' CO2 emissions was a job well done, even though I believe that the modulation of penalties is still inadequate."
"With regard to the capture and storage of carbon, we are waiting for the agreement on financing."
"On the subject of emission allowances, it is vital to find a fair and realistic way forward."
"The introduction of quantified thresholds is to be welcomed."
"We know, however, that there is still much to be done."
"Agreement at first reading is essential."
"Our businesses and industries expect to be put in the picture about future commitments."
"They need to plan their investments."
"What would people say about the European Union if it did not secure an agreement by the end of the year?"
"The European Union, which likes to think it sets such an example in combating climate change."
"The European Union, which is so ambitious regarding this fight against climate change."
"I dare not imagine how absurd it would be if Europe failed to reach an agreement but nevertheless wanted, in Copenhagen next year, to convince everyone that it is right."
"I would therefore like to wish the French Presidency luck and congratulate it once more on the work it has accomplished."
"(PT) Mr President, climate change is the great problem of our time."
"Urgent action to slow global warming is necessary."
"The Copenhagen Conference is the last chance to avoid collapse at a time when there are positive signs coming from the United States."
"With the election of President Obama, the European Union must present a credible and ambitious proposal in order to mobilise other regions."
"As far as sharing the burden is concerned, an issue which I have followed closely as shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and on which, I hope, we will be able to reach an agreement, I think the Member States have to undertake to reduce CO2 emissions internally, and not only at the expense of external credits."
"The economic crisis is not, as some people here say, the result of environmental policies: it was caused by damaging management and there are probably cases for the police, not politics."
"The European Parliament is doing its homework: it is to be hoped that the Council does the same, without giving in to national selfishness and false arguments."
"The development of new technologies brings opportunities for the economy and for creating jobs."
"I close, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and my dear fellow Members, with an appeal for us to all make an effort to reach an agreement at first reading."
"The world needs an international agreement and the citizens expect us to take measures."
"(BG) Climate change is occurring at ever faster rates than were envisaged."
"If the European Union wants to be a leader at the UN meeting in 2009 in Copenhagen on reaching a global agreement for a real fight against climate change after 2012, then there must be a reduction in greenhouse emissions within the European Union."
"In order for the new Member States to achieve effective reductions in harmful emissions, it would be good to consider the gradual application of a 100% Auction for the electricity production sector, as well as extending the transitional periods."
"The new Member States still rely, to a high degree, on coal as the main primary energy source."
"In these states the transition to alternative energy sources is happening at a slower rate and therefore, tough measures for the reduction of harmful emissions could have undesirable social effects."
"I call upon the Commission and the Council to take into account the fulfilment of the obligations of the Kyoto Protocol up to now and the true preparedness of every single Member State, so that the measures set have an impact."
"(ES) Mr President, first of all I should like to thank all those who have spoken, including the Commission, the Presidency and my fellow Members, for the work that they have done and their willingness to address the issue."
"I shall start by making four points that I believe are fundamental in relation to tackling the problem."
"The first one is that our consumption of coal is growing all the time, for obvious reasons, due to the development of vast areas of the planet, which had not happened before."
"Secondly, as a result of this greater coal consumption CO2 emissions are increasing."
"Thirdly, we must not forget that the competitiveness of industries is now measured globally."
"Fourthly, and no less importantly, we must never forget that when we talk about the economy we are talking above all about people."
"That is because if the economy is fine, people's wellbeing will also be fine and, if not, then the opposite will be the case."
"The last two points mean that the competitiveness of European industry must not be damaged unnecessarily at this time of particular difficulty, when there are no international rules and requirements applicable to the same industries elsewhere in the world."
"The first two points mean that we need a realistic, viable and hence effective international agreement that includes the large CO2-emitting countries, which are also therefore large coal consumers."
"Without such an agreement we cannot efficiently achieve the ultimate objective, which is to reduce those CO2 emissions."
"Representatives of the Presidency and Commission, ladies and gentlemen, essentially, leadership consists of proposing formulae enabling us to achieve our objectives."
"The rest is not much more than fantasy."
"(LT) None of the European Union countries has yet faced the problems of the scale which will fall over Lithuania in one year."
"I am referring to power industry problems."
"According to the accession treaty to the EU, Lithuania will have to shut down the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant, which produces about 70% of the electricity requirements of the country."
"The Commission's proposal to Lithuania authorised a slight increase in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2005, but the proposal does not take into account the consequences of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant decommissioning, and indeed after that the Lithuanian power plants will generate nearly double the volume of such gases."
"After 2009 Lithuania will be the only one of the new European Union countries to lack emission permits."
"All this will negatively affect industry and the entire economy, as well as private users."
"It is anticipated that electricity prices will rise to double their current level, or more."
"The growing use of fossil fuel energy sources will increase emissions by 5 million tonnes annually."
"Therefore, Lithuania hopes to receive an exemption roughly corresponding in size from the emission trade system rules for annual non-saleable emission permits, until a new power plant is built."
"The climate change package is extremely important and sensitive."
"I understand that each country has its own challenges and features."
"It would be very sad if requests for exceptions upset this fragile document, which is so necessary for Europe and the entire world."
"However, the Lithuanian situation is truly dramatic, and also unique, as we do not have a connection to the western European electric grid."
"I encourage the trialogue participants to take this into account."
"Mr President, eyes and minds are now focused on the key issues and that is why I think we are making progress But, Minister and Commissioner, you have not heard today the voice that I think you should be hearing and that is voice of the low-income countries."
"Some of us have just returned from the ACP meeting in Papua New Guinea and we know that the low-income countries are the biggest victims of our past growth and they need our support."
"The Pacific islands are quite literally sinking beneath the waves."
"Global warming is bringing new diseases, mosquitoes carrying malaria and dengue fever into that region."
"We return to find letters from the peripheral maritime regions of Europe saying much the same thing."
"They are desperate for us to take action to support them, too."
"At the ACP meeting we looked at the consequences of failing to prevent and failing to manage climate change."
"Even if we meet our 2o target that means a 25% reduction in water availability; it means a 10% decline in crop yields; it means 50 million more people subject to malaria; it means 10 million more subject to coastal flooding; it means dramatic increases in respiratory, cardiovascular, vector-borne diseases, skin cancer and eyesight problems."
"If they fail, we fail."
"Their diseases are already our diseases."
"Their migration will become our migration."
"Their desperation could lead to desperation as they spill across our borders too and it is for our sakes as much as for theirs that we must help them make progress, and make it quickly."
"(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking our rapporteur Mr Turmes for his impressive work in connection with the directive on renewable energy."
"Similarly, I would also like to thank Parliament's various secretariats, advisors and assistants."
"Unfortunately, we were unable to conclude the negotiations with the Council overnight, even if, from Parliament's side, we were aiming for an agreement and we were ready to make concessions."
"Yet, as you know, it takes two to tango and two willing parties to achieve an agreement."
"As the rapporteur for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on this directive, I had been looking forward to standing here this morning with a fully negotiated package."
"A package that clearly bore our fingerprints."
"This directive will revolutionise Europe's energy policy."
"It will allow us to bring an end to more than a hundred years of dependence on oil and gas."
"A dependence that has damaged our environment and has caused wars, unrest and inequality all over the world."
"It is therefore crucial that we now cross the t's and dot the i's on this agreement."
"We have already ensured that clear and robust sustainability criteria will be laid down for the production of biofuels for our cars."
"We have ensured that the heavy energy consumption by buildings will be restricted and we have ensured that producers of wind turbines and solar cells will have a guarantee that Europe will invest in renewable energy."
"The last stumbling block is that we are standing by all the binding targets for 2020."
"The problem is that a single Member State is blocking an agreement."
"All I can do, therefore, is to make a vigorous appeal to the Council to re-evaluate its position in order to allow Europe to obtain the energy agreement that we so badly need."
"(SV) Mr President, it is one of the most important tasks of Europe and the European Union now to ensure that we get an international commitment to take seriously the global targets relating to climate policy."
"It will also be one of the most important tasks of the Swedish Presidency to ensure that we get this international commitment at the Copenhagen conference."
"I believe it may be important when discussing these issues to remember that success in Copenhagen, with a broad international commitment, means much more than the various details of the package that we are now discussing."
"That is why it is so important to ensure that we now get a climate change package in place that fulfils the targets we have set."
"I believe it is important that we are pragmatic when it comes to the various means."
"If we are pragmatic about the various means and at the same time ensure that we achieve the targets, we will also guarantee that we get broad support for what needs to be done and ensure that the various Member States have an enduring will to live up to the various commitments made."
"That is the important thing, and this is the perspective from which we are continuing with various types of efforts."
"I would emphasise that we must also be clear on one thing, and that is that we must always make room for the initiatives that produce the best results."
"This means that we must allow room for investments to be made in other countries where the results will be greatest."
"This does not mean making lesser demands of ourselves, but it is essential to realise that we must focus on what we can do to help other countries."
"Finally, the resources that are now released through auctions should accrue to the Member States for different measures in the various countries."
"(NL) Mr President, emotions are running high now that the finishing touches are being put on the climate change package."
"Some claim that the climate should wait, in any event until the crisis is over, but that is not a good idea."
"First of all, it is absolutely vital that we take action promptly to prevent global warming, which is said to be faster than predicted."
"Secondly, we are running out of oil."
"We really need to move towards a sustainable energy supply."
"Thirdly, effective climate policy is a good weapon against the recession."
"Investments in sustainable energy, in infrastructure for green energy and energy efficiency in buildings create millions of jobs, and this is not to be sniffed at."
"Needless to say, we have to make sure that employment in the steel, paper or automotive sector does not disappear abroad."
"As things are looking at the moment, the package is moving in the right direction, although we have to ensure it does not become an empty shell."
"We can in any event be satisfied with the agreement on the Fuels Directive."
"A 10% reduction in CO2 on the basis of a well-to-wheel analysis sends a positive and powerful message, certainly in times when oil companies are expending increasingly more energy on producing petrol and diesel."
"The Fuels Directive thus gives an important impulse for worldwide reductions in emissions, burning off, greater use of electricity in road transport and opting for more efficient biofuels that meet strict sustainability requirements."
"By doing so, Europe sets the tone."
"In the US too, similar initiatives have been taken, and the post-petrol era is now in sight."
"(DE) Mr President, many thanks to the Commission and also to the Council for having presented this climate package to us."
"I do not think one single figure, one target or even one percentage should be changed in this package."
"However, President-in-Office of the Council, I am only too aware that we are under enormous time pressure."
"I do not have the time to answer this today in two minutes though."
"I should like to examine one point with which you are familiar: I should like to draw the attention of the European Union to the question of whether we should really begin this highly determined auctioning straight away in 2013, when we know very well that our American friends and our friends in India and in China will not have such instruments by then."
"I propose that these regulations be adopted in the Kyoto Protocol II or in Copenhagen and we start this auctioning in Europe on the day on which the Copenhagen or Kyoto Protocol is passed."
"Please do not take away from the companies the capital that they are not getting from the banks at the moment."
"We need this capital to fill up the cap."
"We want this in particular - and by 2012."
"I think it is wrong for us in the EU to send European industry out onto the world market with leaden shoes while our American friends are in trainers in India."
"That is not fair."
"It must not be allowed to happen."
"They must all have comparable shoes."
"I am passionate about this, precisely so the targets are achieved."
"It is quite obvious to me that we need money in order to also have compensation outside Europe in the Latin American countries."
"That is not in dispute at all."
"However, we should make the tools for the emissions trade such that industry has equal conditions."
"I support this, without changing even a single parameter."
"I wanted to repeat this because there are people in this House who imply we wanted to change the targets."
"That, Mr Dimas, we do not want."
"(SV) Mr President, the Council and Parliament are after all negotiating at present on the climate change package."
"Whilst it would be a fantastic achievement for the cooperation if we could get this in place before Christmas, I must say that I am very concerned at the direction the negotiations are taking."
"According to the latest research, we would need to reduce emissions by more than the amount prescribed by the climate change package."
"Yet the Council of Ministers, and particularly a number of governments of the right represented therein, are moving towards a watering down of the package."
"Moreover, as a Swede it is with a heavy heart that I note that the Swedish Conservative-controlled Government is one of the main players preventing the EU from making progress on the climate change package."
"For a number of reasons the majority of the EU's emissions reductions must take place on home soil: firstly, because we have a moral responsibility to reduce our own emissions; secondly, because it is by taking the lead and showing that reduced emissions are compatible with high economic growth that we can get other countries to sign up to an international climate change agreement; thirdly, because we must have an incentive in place if our industry is to develop the new green technology required in order for us to be competitive in the future."
"I would therefore urge Parliament to oppose the Swedish Government's position and to assert that the bulk of the emissions reduction must take place in Europe; and also that a proportion of the revenues from emissions trading should go to developing countries."
"Then we will be credible, and then we will be able to get an international climate agreement in place in Copenhagen in autumn 2009."
"(DE) Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Borloo."
"You will be combating unemployment and poverty in the coming months and years."
"We therefore require a sensible package."
"We do not need free allocation up to 100% in the industry affected by carbon leakage, we need 100% allocation, and we need ex ante benchmarks."
"For those businesses not at risk from carbon leakage, I believe the 20/20 solution is the best so that we can start with 20% increases and also achieve the target with 20% increases."
"We also want the small and medium-sized businesses to be exempted here, that is to say, in particular, the businesses with 25 000 tonnes, which are to be increased to 50 000 tonnes. Then we would still have 80% of SMEs outside which have only 27% of the CO2."
"We should also make an effort to keep the money in the businesses and not to tax it and send it abroad."
"We urgently need the money in the businesses in order to be able to promote innovation and research."
"Please also ensure that decreasing depreciation is possible, so that businesses can invest in these areas quickly and in good time."
"We also need a formula in the international agreement which specifies up to 30% and not 30% as an absolute figure."
"We also need a clear idea of what an international agreement must contain."
"In the case of heat pumps, I would request that we really ensure that air-air heat pumps are also included accordingly because in that way, together with solar energy, we can naturally prevent a great deal of CO2."
"I also request that we make the International Atomic Energy Safety Standards mandatory for the European nuclear industry and that we have independent regulators in Europe who can also share in decision-making in the other Member States in order to ensure safety here."
"Mr President, many of the new Member States, like Hungary after the end of the 1980s and the collapse of the old industry, reduced their greenhouse gas emissions."
"Due to this process, every sixth Hungarian - about a million people - lost his or her job."
"As the basis for the reduction here in the current proposal is 2005 and not 1990, some older Member States could raise their emission values without any consequences."
"This is very unfair to the new Member States."
"After the losses in our economy we need fair compensation."
"District heating is mainly a social question in many new Member States."
"The decision of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety that gives free allowances for district heating in the ETS is essential for us, and we must keep this achievement during the trialogue as well."
"I think that the use of carbon capture and storage should be judged by the market and the competition."
"As this is a very new and expensive technology, we have to be more cautious before subsidising it with public money."
"My last point is that without a proper penalty system the whole package will fail."
"If we do not force the Member States to keep to the emission limits, all our efforts are wasted."
"That is why I urge this Parliament to insist that we should keep our achievements concerning the penalty system because, without a penalty system, there will be no working system at all."
"Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please."
"Although we are very close to the end of the debate, I am going to have to interrupt for reasons that you will understand."
"The next item is the formal sitting at 11.30 a.m. with His Holiness the Dalai Lama; following the formal sitting this debate will continue."
"There are just two speakers left on my list, plus anyone wishing to speak under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure, and the representatives of the Council and the Commission."
"After we have finished debating the state of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package, we will proceed with voting as normal."
"(The debate was suspended at 11.30 a.m. for the formal sitting)"
"Formal sitting - Dalai Lama"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and pleasure to welcome His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama in the plenary of the European Parliament today."
"We eagerly await your thoughts on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and the significance of this dialogue for peace and international understanding which you will share with us today in the plenary of the European Parliament."
"During 2008 we already had the honour of greeting representatives of the Christian religion, the Jewish religion and of Islam here, and today we have the opportunity to hear a leading representative of Buddhism."
"Your Holiness, at this time our thoughts go above all to the victims of the bloody attacks in Mumbai and to the people in India, the country in which you live in exile."
"At precisely a time of such great challenges, religious leaders like you who advocate dialogue, peace and reconciliation have an essential contribution to make to our social life."
"The European Parliament has always endeavoured to raise its voice for the rights and dignity of man."
"The culture and freedom of religious expression touch directly on people's identity and are therefore inseparably linked with human dignity."
"In this connection, the European Parliament has constantly endeavoured to draw attention to the human rights of the Tibetan people."
"When you, Your Holiness, gave a speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg in 1988, you spoke of a five-point peace plan for Tibet."
"You also visited us in 2001 and 2006."
"During this period, the European Parliament took a number of resolutions in which it asked the Chinese Government to start an immediate and meaningful dialogue and to respect the cultural and religious identity and the human rights of the Tibetan people."
"On behalf of the European Parliament I should like to stress again: the European Parliament recognises the territorial unity of China, to which Tibet belongs."
"However, we will always defend the right of the Tibetan people to live their cultural and religious identity."
"We will always defend this right."
"(Applause)"
"What has been going on in Lhasa and other towns since 10 March is proof of the urgent need for a proper dialogue, with which an acceptable, sustainable solution for all sides will be worked towards with respect for the culture, religion and identity of Tibet."
"For these reasons we are deeply concerned that the talks started in 2002 between your special envoys and the Chinese state institutions have achieved no results yet."
"We express our urgent expectation that future talks will bring the desired results."
"China is a significant nation and an important partner of the European Union."
"In our dialogue with China we are under an obligation to openly and sincerely espouse our common values of democracy, law, human rights and freedom of opinion, based on the fundamental principle of human dignity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if we were to stop espousing these principles, we would give up ourselves."
"I also stated these principles yesterday in a conversation with the Chinese Representative to the European Union."
"As you, Your Holiness, said a few years ago, each of us must learn not only to work for oneself, one's own family or one's own nation, but for the benefit of all mankind."
"You are, Your Holiness, an important advocate of dialogue."
"Your non-violent stance provides an excellent example of involved, peaceful commitment to a worthy cause, and we are honoured that you are speaking to the European Parliament today."
"It is with great pleasure that I now invite you to speak to us."
"(Applause)"
"Your Excellency, President Pöttering, Honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen,"
"It is a great honour to speak before you today and I thank you for your invitation."
"On the last occasion I was here, I gave my speech in Tibetan and then read the English translation."
"I felt that wasted time, so today my written statement has already been circulated."
"I am not going to repeat what is in there."
"In fact there are some words I cannot pronounce properly so it is better not to read it!"
"The main points I have already mentioned in my written statement, and I do not want to repeat these things."
"I am just one human being out of 6 billion human beings."
"On that level, I believe that every human being wants a happy, successful life; all of us, irrespective of our colour, nationality, religious faith or social status, we all want and all have the right to have a happy life, a successful life."
"As a human being I believe - and for a number of years, many of my friends have agreed with my views and feelings - that in modern times there is too much emphasis on the importance of material values."
"We have somehow neglected our inner values."
"That is why, in spite of materially being highly developed, I have noticed there are still a lot of people - even billionaires - who are very rich but are an unhappy on a personal level."
"So one of the most important factors for happiness or joyfulness is very much to do with peace of mind, a calm mind."
"Too much stress, too much suspicion, too much ambition and greed I also think are factors which destroy our inner peace."
"So therefore, if we wish to achieve a happy life, there is no point in neglecting our inner values."
"These inner values are not necessarily what we bring from religious teaching, but I feel they are a biological factor we are already equipped with: warm-heartedness or a sense of responsibility, a sense of community."
"The biological factor is there because we are social animals."
"That is what I usually call 'secular ethics' and it is the basis of our happy life, our inner peace."
"The ways I generally emphasise to promote that are secular ways: the secular method means using our common sense and common experience and the latest scientific findings."
"Even for our physical well-being, peace of mind is very essential."
"I should like to illustrate this by a small experience of my own."
"I recently underwent surgery to remove my gall bladder."
"So, in contrast to my previous visit here, I have the same face but one organ is now missing!"
"But, since then I am OK, quite fit!"
"(Laughter)"
"Seriously, during surgery and also after surgery there were some quite serious complications."
"Usually gall bladder removal takes 15 to 20 minutes, but in my case it took three hours because of complications."
"However, after the surgery, within one week I had fully recovered."
"So the doctors were a little bit surprised."
"I told them that I had nothing special."
"No miracle power."
"No healing power."
"If I had miracle powers or healing power, I would not have needed surgery in the first place."
"The very fact that I underwent surgery means that I have no such miracle power, does it not?"
"But I really think that peace of mind is one factor in a speedy recovery."
"So this is my number one commitment, the promotion of human values."
"Number two is the promotion of religious harmony."
"In that respect - I mean peace of mind - all the major religions have the message of how to develop inner peace."
"Particularly when we are passing through difficult situations or hopelessness, faith provides us with inner strength and hope."
"So all the major religious traditions basically fall into two categories: one is theistic religion, the other is non-theistic religion."
"Buddhism belongs to the non-theistic religions."
"Buddhism and Jainism both form part of the Indian tradition."
"These different philosophies, different ways of approach, ultimately have the same message, the same practice, the practice of love, compassion, forgiveness, contentment and self-discipline."
"So therefore all the major religious traditions have the same potential but they come from different locations, and different peoples with different mental dispositions."
"We need different ways of approach."
"Theistic philosophy and non-theistic philosophy have developed: that does not matter."
"These philosophies matter, but the important thing is the real purpose, the real message."
"So in that respect, all religious traditions carry the same message, the same practice and the same effect."
"So harmony among the different religious traditions is quite possible."
"And yet now - not only in past history, but even today - there are still conflicts happening in the name of religion."
"So therefore we need a special effort for the promotion of religious harmony."
"This may be irrelevant, but I see that here among the Parliament members there are many women."
"One of my beliefs (and I am not saying this just to appease the women here!) is that in human history, in the earliest periods, there was no concept of leaders."
"All family members worked together, all the community members worked together, hunting or collecting fruits or things like that, and they shared equally."
"Eventually the population increased."
"Then stealing, bullying and that sort of thing happened. So then the concept of leadership arose."
"At that time the brain was not very important."
"The important thing was physical strength, like other animals."
"This, I think, is why male dominance developed."
"Then eventually through education, brain development took place and the brain became more important than physical strength."
"So then male and female had more or less equal weight."
"And so it is that many Members here are female."
"Some are rather beautiful!"
"(Laughter and applause)"
"So, as I mentioned earlier, in our century, in our time, we need to promote human compassion, human love, warm-heartedness."
"In that respect, I think because of biological factors, females have more feelings of sensitivity about others' pain."
"Do you agree?"
"(Cries of 'Yes!')"
"I think I should ask the men, not the women."
"I have not much time but I will tell one short story."
"Once during a long, eight- or nine-hour flight from India to another country, a night flight, I noticed one couple with two young children, one I think six or seven years old, one very small."
"So the whole night that young one really created trouble for his parents."
"At the beginning the father also took care of that young boy or girl."
"Then after two or three hours the father just slept."
"But all night the mother was always paying attention to those naughty children."
"Always she paid them the fullest care, and then next morning I noticed the mother's eyes were red."
"This is one example."
"The female has more sensitivity to other people's pain."
"So therefore at this time we need not only smart brains and ideas but also we need warm-heartedness."
"In such periods, I feel, women have a special role."
"Therefore I am very happy to see many women here."
"This is something I have said on many occasions, and I just wanted to share this now."
"Now to the Tibetan issue."
"(Applause)"
"Basically, some Chinese officials consider our approach to be that of a separatist movement, but it is not."
"That is totally wrong."
"Everybody knows that we are seeking genuine autonomy within the People's Republic of China, in our own interest."
"Tibet is materially backward - though of course it is spiritually advanced - so by now every Tibetan wants a modernised Tibet."
"Therefore, as far as material development is concerned, it is in our own interest to remain within the big nation - the People's Republic of China."
"So firstly I want to make it very clear that our approach is not a separatist movement."
"Certain rights which we have requested from the Chinese officials are actually already guaranteed or mentioned in their constitution, as well as certain rights of minorities."
"Another point I want to make clear to our supporters is that, when you are showing your support, your concern about the Tibet question, some Chinese feel this is something against China."
"That is totally wrong."
"Actually we are trying to make a contribution regarding the promotion of a harmonious society, stability, unity."
"Obviously it is a matter of common sense, of common experience: how can unity and harmony develop under fear, under guns?"
"It is illogical."
"Genuine harmony, unity, only come through trust, through mutual respect."
"Let me take one example."
"Since we are not seeking independence and we adhere strictly to non-violent principles, some of our friends from Xinjiang, who are also fighting for their rights, now think our approach is more effective."
"Many years ago I met some Xinjiang people - I cannot remember the individual names - they really used to fight for independence and even if necessary used violence."
"That is their view."
"Then I told these people: as far as we Tibetans are concerned, we are not seeking separation and also follow a strictly non-violent way."
"Eventually more Xinjiang people now agree that our approach is realistic and the best approach."
"Our approach actually gave more encouragement to those people who once took the violent way and therefore disapproved of us."
"We are helping to build a healthy, harmonious society."
"So we, and our supporters, are not against the Chinese, China or the Chinese Government."
"Actually we are helping them."
"Obviously there are many drawbacks in totalitarian regimes: it is a closed society, there is no freedom of speech, no freedom of the press."
"So difficulties are bound to occur."
"There is a Tibetan saying: 'If you are a true close friend, then make clear the faults of your friend'."
"So for the European Union, naturally, it is very important to keep close relations with the People's Republic of China; but at the same time you should make clear those drawbacks, those mistakes."
"Now I have not much time."
"Yesterday I met some Tibetan support groups to which MEPs belong."
"They told me they were going to fast for 24 hours."
"If some of those people are going to practise fasting, that is very good."
"I very much appreciate that."
"So I immediately responded, we are also going to fast."
"In my case, as a Buddhist monk, after lunch I have no more meals."
"So I thought that a better practical way would be for my fasting to start after my breakfast."
"So this morning I started my fasting after my breakfast."
"As a Buddhist monk, breakfast is something very sacred because I always eat when I wake up, as I always feel hungry."
"Therefore I have had my breakfast now, and until tomorrow breakfast I am fasting and sharing with your determination."
"Thank you very much."
"(The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"Your Holiness, you are a personality of dialogue."
"I have 29 years' experience in the European Parliament, but I have never experienced a situation where the speaker taking the floor had a dialogue with the Parliament."
"If anybody in the world - including the Chinese Government - has any doubt that you are a personality of dialogue, your speech today was the proof that you are a personality of dialogue."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"In the name of the European Parliament, I have the honour of thanking you for your presence today and I am thankful that you are healthy again."
"You have proved that you are healthy again after your operation, but we never thought that you would share all your experiences with us."
"This shows your confidence in the Members of the European Parliament."
"You gave us a clear political message and you gave us a clear human message."
"I want to thank you, in the name of the European Parliament for these messages, and we thank you for your excellent humour."
"I think it is now our duty, dear colleagues, to help His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama to ensure that his people, the Tibetan people, have a good future and can live within their culture and their religion."
"Your Holiness, the European Parliament is with you."
"Thank you for your presence and thank you for your speech."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"State of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package (continuation of debate)"
"We shall resume the debate on the state of the negotiations on the climate change and energy package."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I should like to inform the Members of this House that this morning the Court of First Instance in Luxembourg ordered that the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran should be taken off the EU terror list."
"This is the third time this ruling has been made and this should be a warning to the Council and the Commission that their attempts to appease the mullahs and the oppressive regime in Tehran by putting the PMOI on the EU terror list constitute an offence against freedom and liberty."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you do not mind, we shall therefore resume the order of speaking time."
"(DE) Madam President, Presidency of the Council and Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has in recent years always been very bold in exercising its own rights."
"We have not let ourselves be swayed either when we invited the Dalai Lama, or when we took a decision regarding the Sakharov prize, or with regard to participation in the Olympics."
"I am therefore very concerned that we are not exercising our rights sufficiently regarding such an important matter, which evidently only generates limited interest today and which some fellow Members have described as the question of the century."
"I would ask the Presidency of the Council and the Parliamentary Leadership to ensure that we not only talk of better regulation, but that we actually also have the opportunity to see and examine texts."
"At the moment, for example, in the case of emissions trading, talks are based not on Parliament's opinion but only on the decision of a single committee."
"There have been four committees which have made decisions, the assumptions of which have not been brought into the trialogue."
"One rapporteur negotiates, and 784 Members have no opportunity to contribute their opinion."
"The procedure is scheduled thus: 10/11 December Council, 15 December Trialogue, and then decisions will be made."
"This will mean that we as individual parliamentarians have no opportunity to look at the text, to evaluate it, to discuss and reach a sound decision on it."
"We already had difficulties in conducting the discussion seriously today, we had to start later, we had to suspend proceedings, now hardly anyone is listening."
"But that says it all."
"We are making decisions about taxes of EUR 70 billion for people."
"And we do not appear to give ourselves even a few hours, a few days to have a thorough look."
"I think that is irresponsible."
"I ask the Presidency of the Council and I also ask the Presidency of this House to ensure that we can all give ourselves the necessary time."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SL) Ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that right in this period of time we have had a very ambitious Presidency, which has truly worked hard to find an agreement on the climate and energy package."
"In spite of all this, I have my doubts about the appropriateness of the agreement process in the first reading, since such extensive and challenging documents raise the question of transparency and the question of adequate representation of the majority view in Parliament, and this then naturally broaches the subject of how democratic this process is."
"I would therefore like us to give things a little more thought next time before confirming that we will deal with some document by agreement in the first reading."
"There would be nothing wrong in us concluding a normal first reading in December, and then performing a second reading before the end of our term and coming to an appropriate agreement with the Council."
"It is therefore not surprising that there has not been much discussion of the details in this debate, since Members are not particularly familiar with them."
"I would like to speak mainly about the use of funds from auctions."
"I think here we need to take into account certain principles, and specifically that we must use funds absolutely exclusively for tackling environmental and climate challenges, that we must use them for mitigation and adaptation and that we must use them to develop technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and that are not yet commercial - in other words, this should include CCS pilot projects."
"This is not just important for the European Union, but also for third countries such as China."
"In this case we must use the funds for measures within the European Union and for cooperation with third countries, and when we talk about the level of emissions, we must take into account our responsibility for global emissions, currently running at 13 to 14 per cent, and also add to this our historical responsibility for emissions."
"We must also use the financial resources for already existing mechanisms - in other words, we should not be setting up any new funds."
"I would like to thank the entire negotiating group and inform them that this agreement will see us well on the way to the negotiations in Poznań next week."
"(FI) Madam President, we know very well that Parliament's position on the climate package is not united."
"On many issues my own group is closer to the Council's position than Parliament's."
"It is nevertheless important to remember that we are completely unanimous on the matter of emission reductions: emissions have to be cut."
"It is just a matter of how."
"Some want to do it the expensive way, by auction, and we want to do it the cost-effective way, through benchmarking."
"The representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance expressed the desire openly in the negotiations for prices to rise so that consumer habits might change."
"Our group has no faith in this sort of logic as long as emissions trading is unilateral."
"As long as it is, it is just a tax."
"If the emissions trading playing field were global, auctions would be a good option."
"The price of emission rights could easily be reflected in consumer prices, which in turn would prompt consumers to choose cleaner products."
