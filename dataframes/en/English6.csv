"That is what we are doing here, Mr President, all playing out together."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rationale of maximising profits leads to all sorts of aberrations, including feeding herbivores on meat-based meal."
"It is not just the cows that went mad, and as a result, ovine scrapie spread to bovine animals in the form of BSE."
"Consumer welfare demands that we use every means possible to prevent and vigorously combat these diseases and their vectors. The action taken in 1997 is now proving even more inadequate as scientists are today talking about a third transmission route."
"We must therefore provide ourselves with effective means to eradicate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies once and for all, if at all possible."
"This means coordinating and dealing with the sector as soon as waste is used in animal fodder, destroying at-risk materials if there is suspicion, banning the inclusion of animal protein in cattle fodder, demanding traceability by labelling the animal' s site of birth and rearing, and, at Member State level, setting up the local monitoring systems which are the only ways to guarantee that the campaign will be effective and that monitoring will be transparent, setting in place a fast, systematic screening procedure and also in-depth checks, if necessary."
"Finally, the whole herd must be slaughtered if one beast is found to be infected."
"This is the price of food safety, but it must not be used as an excuse to cast doubt on the transportation of live animals."
"Mr President, in stressing the excellent quality of the work carried out by Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge, I would like to dwell on one aspect and take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Byrne."
"Clearly, our goal has to be total elimination, but we feel that this would be extremely difficult as the costs of incinerating the large numbers of animals which die on farms are objectively huge."
"Consequently, the economic burdens and the amount of technical organisation involved could be extensive, and so could the environmental impact of such large-scale incineration carried out at extremely high temperatures."
"In this sense, we ought to ask the Commission - and insist on a reply - whether realistic estimates of the quantities of material to be incinerated are already available to us, whether they have already been made or whether this still remains to be done, according to the various classification procedures of the States, together with an evaluation of the resulting organisational economic burdens, with subsequent referral to Parliament."
"It is therefore essential to prevent the adoption of different, uncoordinated paths by individual Member States from causing substantial distortion of competition and disproportion in the treatment reserved for producers."
"It is necessary to provide for the adoption of harmonised financial support measures, lay down common organisational guidelines and use applied research measures to develop new disposal technologies with less environmental impact which allow the use of forms of materials recycling which respect consumer safety requirements."
"The development of common guidelines should allow firmer, more balanced and, therefore, more effective responses."
"For example, we consider that setting up mandatory disposal consortia according to the model already laid down by the legislation of some Member States could be a practical response to the need to limit the economic impact of disposal operations on breeders and, at the same time, thanks to the increase in the degree of social control over the proper use of the service, to the need to consolidate consumer and environmental guarantees."
"We conclude that the adoption of the excellent regulation in question will require the development of a combination of initiatives, research and analysis, but also regulation and standardisation, and we hope that Parliament will associate itself with these measures."
"Mr President, we have before us a very important directive, aimed at creating a uniform legal basis for the prevention and control of TSEs."
"The objective is to gather into one dossier all regulations relating to TSEs to date."
"If we are to restore consumer confidence, it is essential that we do all we possibly can at all levels."
"I should particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the vigour she has shown in her approach to this matter - many of her proposals deserve agreement."
"Mr Böge, for his part, has ensured that these views will gain wide support in this Chamber."
"I agree that the Commission for its part has done a good job, a job that Parliament can endorse, whereas Member States must eventually be made to understand that this matter is important and that we must gain consumer confidence."
"I should, however, like to draw your attention to one more issue: those countries and farms, which have escaped the animal diseases, must also be able to ensure that they will not have these problems in future."
"It is therefore essential that the withdrawal period relating to the transfer of animals from one farm to another be increased from two years to six years."
"On the whole, we must firmly hold to the notion that within the internal market, too, human health is the most important thing, and that principles of free competition only take second place."
"It is imperative that we bear this in mind, particularly when dealing with these food matters, which are all-important to consumers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report and to thank her for her openness to discussion on the issues involved."
"She will appreciate even better than I how far scientific opinion on TSEs has developed."
"For example, the Scientific Steering Committee has recently established that it is necessary to regard the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglion as specified risk material in the UK only for bovines over 30 months and in Portugal only for those over 6 months."
"That is why some of us seek an Amendment No 56 to allow adjustments in this area on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee rather than requiring fresh legislation to implement them."
"Similarly, certain measures in combating TSEs have already proved effective."
"I refer to the exclusion of animals over 30 months from the food chain, the slaughter and disposal of suspects and offspring of BSE cases, a fully effective feed ban and the removal of a wide range of specified risk materials."
"Where such measures are in place, in seems unnecessary to impose the more technical requirement of the date-based export scheme and the certified animal scheme to the domestic market; hence, Amendment No 53."
"In addition, given that there is no evidence of horizontal transmission of TSEs, there would seem to be no scientific requirement for whole-herd slaughter."
"While accepting that some Member States may wish to engage in the practice, I would submit that it should not be compulsory."
"Indeed, we take TSE and BSE very seriously in the United Kingdom."
"We are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare."
"We only ask that given that we have taken these measures which we believe to be effective, you do not ask to us to take additional measures which have no scientific justification for them."
"Mr President, Mrs Roth-Behrendt' s report seeks to strengthen consumer protection measures but also to extend Parliament' s scope of action, by ensuring that all issues crucial to the prevention of TSEs are included in the regulatory instrument, not just in the annexes which are not covered by the codecision procedure."
"This twofold concern seems to be particularly justified today, as French experience shows."
"The fact is that considering the range of measures already undertaken, such as the ban on animal-protein meal for bovine animals, the incidence of mad cow disease in France should have started to decline, but this is not the case, and in fact the number of cases is on the increase."
"It is this tendency which presents a problem right now, much more than the scale of the epidemic in quantitative terms."
"The truth is, at the present time, there is quite simply no adequate explanation for it, hence the debate which has been initiated on the possible existence of alternative disease transmission routes of which we are, as yet, unaware."
"Medical and scientific uncertainty still prevails."
"In these circumstances, the precautionary principle must be adopted to the full."
"All possible resources must be used in order to assess the BSE situation in the various countries, particularly including the development and systematic use of fast screening tests."
"The development of BSE in France raises issues that are not purely medical in the narrowest sense."
"This is nothing new."
"From the very beginning, it has not been possible to give any explanation for the emergence of this disease and its transmission to human beings, and its spread internationally, without taking the key socio-economic factors into account: contemporary trends in the agro-industry, the subordination of producers and consumers to the dominating rationale of capitalistic profit."
"Still today, the way in which the agro-industry is organised, and the fact that it is infiltrated by international mafia-like networks, make the fight to eradicate BSE and TSEs even more difficult."
"No public health policy should ignore these factors."
"They are, however, discussed only on rare occasions and in little detail by the European institutions, including Parliament."
"Basically, BSE is one of those medical matters which, in practical and terribly human terms, bears witness to the acute nature of the choices that society makes, and that is yet another reason why preventing TSEs is a political matter to which Parliament' s responsibility is truly committed."
"Mr President, as an MEP representing a farming area, I have first-hand experience of how devastating the BSE crisis has been to British agriculture."
"I can also vouch for the necessity of maintaining effective controls."
"You might therefore expect me to be enthusiastic about these new controls on BSE, but I am not."
"We already have enough and I believe they are adequate and effective."
"This proposal simply adds more red tape and costs to an already overburdened industry."
"Of course, I have no objections to other countries adopting measures which match ours."
"In fact, it would be helpful if measures already in place in the UK were implemented throughout the EU and elsewhere."
"Thus it is not new laws we need - we need more compliance."
"Until all Member States are able to assure us that there is full compliance, this proposal, if passed, will simply add to the list of laws which have not been implemented."
"In any case, if more controls were needed, we should not be looking to the Commission for guidance."
"The British BSE inquiry which was commissioned by the UK Government at a cost of £20 million is due to report in November."
"We should wait to see what this inquiry says."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to add my voice to the congratulations addressed to our rapporteurs, particularly Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"Her approach and hence her report is one we can wholeheartedly support."
"This regulation is not a major revolution, but it does attempt nonetheless to afford a higher level of protection, based, moreover, on the most stringent practices adopted in specific European Union countries, such as in France."
"I should, however, like to draw your attention to a number of specific points and, firstly, the existence of a third transmission route which is now practically certain."
"I think it essential in this case to define suspect animals quite apart from the age criterion."
"The age criterion ceases to be justified as soon as we are practically assured that this third transmission route does in fact exist."
"The important thing, then, is to have systematic recourse to testing whenever an animal dies of unknown causes."
"Systematic testing precludes fraud and makes it possible to offer better guarantees."
"The issue of slaughtering herds has been discussed at length."
"In both France and Germany the whole herd is slaughtered if a single animal is found to be diseased."
"We know that this is not the practice in Great Britain, and that this is a solution which is vigorously opposed by our fellow Members from the United Kingdom."
"But is it possible to put the argument of the costs of destroying a herd when a public health issue is involved?"
"I think this is not a tenable position."
"It is important for the regulations of the various countries of the European Union to be harmonised."
"I should, finally, like to talk about at-risk materials, these notorious substances which may present risks."
"Once again, in France, a number of measures have been implemented, which have been more or less understood, but I am convinced that it is essential to be extremely vigilant and to apply the precautionary principle."
"So this regulation is a good one."
"It represents some progress, but it is capable of being perfected rather than perfect as it stands."
"It does not raise any questions concerning the incineration of animal-based meal."
"In some of our countries, we have stockpiles of such meal which we do not yet know how best to destroy, or which has not been destroyed sufficiently, and also animal-based meal used for swine and poultry."
"I think, Commissioner, that these are questions we also have to ask."
"Mr President, I asked to be allowed to speak again at the end of the debate - we are not quite at the end."
"Allow me to say a few words on the debate."
"I would like to thank the honourable Members who have spoken so far, and Mrs Doyle, Mr Goodwill and Mr Nicholson, who have yet to speak, for what they have to say and for the fair treatment we are giving each other."
"Those who sat in Parliament during the last parliamentary term know that it is Parliament which has cause to be proud of having got a grip on the BSE disaster in the individual committees and in the House as a whole, in a way which cut across the political divide."
"I tried at all times, as chair of the committee, to be fair to all the Member States, strict but fair, as my teachers always used to say to me, and I am trying to do the same now."
"Allow me therefore to say a few words on some of the points raised."
"Yes, Mr Trakatellis and others are right, Mr Staes."
"We still have no tests for live animals."
"We still have no tests for very early infection, which is why the Commission is being called upon to keep on working on this, and I know that it is doing so."
"Of course we need that."
"Mr Whitehead said quite clearly that safety must be a priority, but he would, of course, like the precautionary principle to be applied in equal measure in other Member States and that is the main point here."
"To some members who have spoken or who have perhaps yet to speak I should like to state one thing quite clearly: we are legislating here for the whole of the European Union, for the 15 Member States with widely varying safety levels."
"We are not legislating just for Great Britain."
"We know that the data-based export scheme, that the OTS over-30-month scheme, that all these things are important and are working."
"I am the first to recognise what Great Britain has achieved and at what price to farmers."
"I have spoken to countless officials and farmers' representatives in Great Britain over recent years and I know that."
"Nonetheless, I must ensure that this level of safety also applies to Italy, Germany and all the other countries in the European Union."
"Which is why I believe that this regulation is a good regulation."
"When Mrs Attwooll and others ask if we can have derogations for countries which are already that good and if they must still remove the spinal column, then I call on you, Mr Byrne, to table a proper list of derogations to the Council saying countries A, B, C and D comply and are exempt from certain measures."
"I will be the first to support it."
"But I do not want this to be rushed, as is the case with certain proposed amendments."
"This is why I stand by the position which I described earlier."
"I think that we really should stick with what we discussed in committee and with what Mrs Doyle and I have re-tabled."
"This particularly applies to proposed Amendment No 56, to which Mrs Attwooll referred."
"I will be the first to support this at second reading, if the Council makes the proposal, but we need to list clearly and to substantiate clearly where derogations are possible and under what conditions and for which Member State."
"What must the Member State do to qualify?"
"And of course I support Mrs Grossetête: naturally, tests must be carried out on animals which have died from unknown causes but that is already included in the Commission' s proposal on the tests."
"Mr President, at the outset I would like to add my thanks to Mrs Roth-Berendt and indeed Mr Böge for their commitment to this important issue."
"For some time Parliament, the Commission and Member States have sought the introduction of common EU-wide rules to deal with the problems of TSEs such as BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep."
"The basis of this proposal is that the discovery of any TSE or the first incidence of BSE in a Member State would be covered by common rules which would take effect automatically."
"To date, many of the actions taken to deal with BSE have been carried out on a unilateral basis by Members using national measures."
"The TSE proposal being put forward includes, among other things, a requirement for educational programmes for farmers, vets and officials; the removal of a list of specified risk material, an active surveillance programme using rapid post-mortem tests; and the strengthening of the ban on the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminant animals."
"The proposal also allows for the culling of animals and the compensation to farmers for loss of culled animals."
"The principle of this approach cannot be faulted."
"Common rules will enhance the protection of animal health and more importantly will ensure protection of the consumer by ensuring that the highest standards of disease prevention and eradication are put in place in every Member State and can be activated when appropriate."
"These rules will form a blueprint that can be followed in the event of any new scientific information being made available or if more radical action is required."
"However, I am aware, Commissioner, that the vast majority of Member States are of the opinion that the classification of countries for SRM removal purposes should be based on an internationally recognised code set out and agreed by the EU and the many - over 150 third countries - under the auspices of the OIE, the World Organisation of Animal Health, which is based in Paris."
"Most Member States are uneasy about the approach being taken by the scientific sub-groups and would prefer a more open and transparent system of classification as set out in the OIE code which is recognised and accepted by countries worldwide."
"This view was made plain in Council working groups and was reflected in the final draft Presidency Proposal, a draft that is supported by the vast majority of Member States."
"For the purpose of agreement and the speedy implementation of this regulation and hopefully to avoid a lengthy conciliation process, the use of common OIE criteria would be appropriate."
"Having discussed this with Mrs Roth-Berendt, we have tabled Amendment No 51 to Article 5 as a compromise to this effect."
"I welcome the principle of laying down common rules for the prevention and control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."
"However, this proposal may have negative consequences for countries trading in sheep and this is an important point as it currently stands."
"There is a view that there should be separate rules for scrapie rather than the current mix of rules where the treatment of SRM in sheep depends on the BSE incidence in that particular country."
"I would reiterate in conclusion my support for the use of OIE provisions to have an internationally recognised basis for classification, a basis supported by 150 countries in resolving world trade disputes and recognised by the WTO."
"I make no case for leniency of treatment at all."
"The UK would be in class 4, Ireland would be in class 3 under either classification system, the SSC or the OIE."
"The OIE meets next week in Paris to consider amendments to their classification system and consequently I hope to bring further amendments to this regulation for second reading."
"Mr President, legislation which seeks to protect the public from a terrible brain disease such as new variant CJD should be drafted to complement measures already in place in Member States, to recognise the stage of the epidemic that we are at and have due regard to the body of scientific knowledge we have built up."
"The United Kingdom already has comprehensive and effective measures in place to protect human health and eradicate BSE in our herd."
"This is working."
"Cases of BSE are declining rapidly."
"But most importantly, so far, we have not had a case in an animal born since the complete feed ban was introduced."
"That should be happening around about now, if it was going to."
"No older animals over 30 months of age enter the food chain."
"It is likely that cases may occur due to maternal transmission but these will be isolated and not feed-related, and there is no justification for a return to cohort culling."
"Incidentally - and Mrs Grossetête referred to this - there has been recent press speculation about a third possible infection route through grass contaminated by faecal material."
"This only applies - as I understand - to animals excreting pathogens ingested with contaminated feed, not, as some newspapers inferred, from animals incubating or suffering from this disease."
"I am concerned about the practicality and cost of having to post-mortem all animals for which the cause of death is unknown."
"Very large numbers of animals die of natural causes or common ailments."
"BSE is a degenerative disease which does not cause sudden death anyway."
"Amendment No 26 seeks universally to impose the whole-herd slaughter policy which some Member States with low levels of incidence have introduced in an attempt to reassure the public."
"This could well result in the under-reporting of cases, as we have seen in Switzerland recently."
"BSE is not an infectious disease that is transmitted horizontally."
"Whole-herd slaughter has no scientific justification."
"The majority of herds that have experienced BSE in the UK have had only one or two isolated cases."
"Most herds in Britain are not closed herds and therefore animals come in from all over the place."
"If one of those animals gets a disease, why kill the whole herd?"
"Whole-herd slaughter is not an effective way of reducing cases of BSE."
"It would cost a small fortune for no tangible benefit."
"I hope Parliament, in amending this directive, will do so in the light of sound scientific advice, not as a knee-jerk reaction to tabloid newspaper scare stories."
"It is my pleasure to give the floor to a Member of Parliament who received the title of Great Chief of Rangatira, when he led our delegation to New Zealand."
"Mr President, I will omit replying to that particular remark."
"Can I first of all thank you very much for giving me the floor and can I pay tribute to the rapporteur and indeed to Mr Böge."
"As someone who was in the last Parliament I know how much thankless time and effort they have put in since BSE first began in a very difficult area to try and find a resolution and a way forward to help everyone in a very sensible way."
"I think both of them not only take credit for themselves but indeed bring credit to this Parliament for the way in which they have carried out that duty."
"BSE has unfortunately been with us for some considerable time and I suspect that we have to recognise that it will probably be with us for some years ahead."
"We have to try to find ways by which we can control the disease of BSE and TSE and at the same time create the consumer confidence that is needed because consumer confidence has been lost."
"With respect to Mr Martinez I will only say one word to him - sludge."
"I will say no more as far as that is concerned."
"Everybody has problems in the European Union of one type or the other and no-one should try to make or take advantage of the other's problem."
"However, whatever we do, we should not overburden the producer because he has already been considerably overburdened."
"As to the argument whether you slaughter the whole of the herd, there is no scientific evidence to say you should."
"There are many instances in my area where maybe BSE occurred five, six or seven years ago in one animal and there has never been another case since."
"Once we get to the stage where we have a vaccine or some way of identifying or testing if an animal has BSE, then there is an argument for testing the rest of the herd and if there is a trigger level whereby it goes beyond that, then the whole herd should be taken out."
"But it would be wilful carnage to simply go in and slaughter good animals in the thought or the notion that BSE may possibly be in the whole herd."
"That would be a drastic approach."
"One other point: where I come from, in recent years there has been a continuing downward trend."
"Indeed, in Northern Ireland last year, we only had, I think, three identifiable cases of BSE and the projection for this year is one or at worst maybe two."
"I was listening to what the rapporteur said that if there are clear reasons then she would agree for areas that have low instances of BSE to have certain controls and mechanisms."
"That is an important thing to recognise because in my area farmers feel very secure because of the very low instances we have of BSE and because of the strict controls that we have monitored and made sure worked over recent years."
"That is perhaps why our situation is much better than the rest of the United Kingdom."
"This is an area which has to be looked at in the months ahead - we must create the confidence within ourselves that we can begin to move forward as we begin, hopefully, to see the back of the TSE/BSE problem."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the congratulations to the rapporteur on her excellent report."
"The report that we now have before us is an example of the kind of issue which requires of us the ability to demonstrate that the European Parliament places public health before internal market considerations."
"The EC Treaty - for instance, Article 30 and points 4 and 8 of Article 95 of that Treaty - presents us with both the opportunity and the duty to do so."
"The priority is to protect consumer health, particularly against diseases like TSE, the mode of infection of which is not adequately known and the testing of which so far is only possible after the symptoms have developed."
"Secondarily - and this is justified by the notion of the internal market - we must be able to restore consumer confidence in the foods on the market in order to enable the market to function with a minimum of disruption."
"Both issues are important, but we must be able to show clearly the priority of values; public health comes first."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted a position that allows both of these objectives to be met."
"One important aspect of this view is the whole-herd slaughter on a farm where disease has been discovered."
"Even without knowledge of whether any of the other animals have become infected, this action is nevertheless justifiable, precisely in order for the above objectives to be met."
"At the same time, we must, of course, ensure that the breeder receives proper compensation for his livestock."
"In addition, the internal market must be able to operate in such a way that the spread of the disease is checked, and so that Member States, where no disease has yet occurred, can rely on the Community to protect the animal population of those States."
"In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I prepared a proposal for an amendment on this matter myself, stating as reasons for the issue specifically the above-mentioned prioritisation of values, where public health is the first."
"This objective has now been met in the Committee report - in a slightly different, but nevertheless satisfactory manner."
"Extending the period referred to in the Annex to the Regulation (the scrapie-free period) from two years to six, may be an adequate means of ensuring that the imported animals and processed material are risk-free, and of preventing the spread of the disease to countries where it does not yet exist."
"Contrary to the Commission' s proposal, the report refers to instant tests, which are being used to detect TSE, by name."
"This in itself is acceptable, but we must bear in mind that we are dealing with a technology which is continually being developed."
"Hopefully, better tests than the current ones will soon be available, and when the time comes, it will be important that the currently approved regulations are kept up to date with the advances in technology."
"Mr President, I am pleased to outline our position on your amendments to our proposed regulation on the prevention and control of TSEs."
"I wish to begin by thanking you for the excellent cooperation between your assistants and my services."
"Due to this thorough preparation I am in a position today to agree in full or in part to almost three-quarters of your proposed amendments."
"Furthermore, most of the amendments, which I am not in a position to accept, relate to two issues: the so-called ""whereas"" clauses - that is the recitals - and whether or not changes to certain provisions of the regulation should be by commitology or codecision."
"That is an issue which I have referred to before."
"I know it is a controversial issue and I look forward to discussing this particular issue in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which is scheduled for July."
"In substance, therefore, the Commission and Parliament are equally committed to a strong regulation which puts in place a comprehensive framework to tackle TSEs."
"I should like especially to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge for their huge contribution to this proposal."
"I can think of no other individuals who have made such a positive contribution to tackling BSE."
"They have both rendered an enormous service to the health protection of Europe's citizens."
"I might also add that this piece of legislation is an excellent example of the good work and cooperation which has taken place between our two institutions and could provide a precedent for the future."
"I turn now to the specific amendments and formal Commission position."
"Firstly, on commitology, we accept Amendments Nos 6, 11, 12, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 and 36."
"With regard to the recitals, I also accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5."
"However, I cannot accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2 because it is inappropriate to introduce recitals in a piece of legislation which are not matched by substantive provisions in the text."
"However, I shall be raising your concerns on pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, which a number of you mentioned, with my colleague Mr Liikanen and I will ask him to address those concerns."
"With regard to the articles themselves, firstly, the scope: I accept Amendments Nos 7 and 8."
"With regard to definitions: I can partly accept Amendments No 9 to Article 13 on the definition of TSE suspected animals."
"But the inclusion of ""fallen cattle, sheep and goats"" in the definition cannot be accepted."
"It is not practicable to collect, incinerate and carry out a full epidemiological investigation on each fallen animal."
"The Commission will, however, be monitoring the situation closely both through the recently agreed measures on random testing for BSE and in the forthcoming proposal on animal waste."
"However, I accept Amendment No 52."
"I also accept Amendments Nos 10 and 49 to Article 3, with a slight reformulation to create the possibility of delegating the evaluation, not the approval, of tests to an external body."
"With regard to classification, BSE status: I accept Amendments Nos 13, 14, 51 and 58."
"With regard to epidemiological surveillance: I accept Amendment No 15 to Article 7, introducing the mandatory use of the rapid diagnostic tests in the annual monitoring programme."
"Let me add, however, in passing, that we will keep under constant review the scope for increased testing of animals for BSE."
"On specified risk material: unfortunately I cannot accept Amendments Nos 16, 17, 18, 40 and 41 to Article 8, bringing under codecision the approval and conditions for use of rapid diagnostic tests."
"I happen to believe that it is essential to maintain the flexibility of the commitology procedure."
"Nor can I accept that tests should be capable of detecting infectivity in all products and at all stages of the disease."
"That is the advice I have been given."
"I partly accept Amendment No 19 to Article 8, requesting a review of the age limits for SRM removal under a commitology procedure."
"I cannot, however, accept the restraint of annual reviews and, in particular, the proposed deadline for the first review which is foreseen for 1 January next, which is too soon."
"I also accept Amendment No 20 to Article 8, which brings under codecision the principle of granting derogations from the provisions on SRM removal in high-risk areas or for taking account of an effective feed ban."
"I also welcome Amendments Nos 38, 39 and 56 to Annex IV."
"They mainly propose no longer requiring the designation of long bones of cattle as SRM and suggest a reformulation of the proposed derogation for the removal of a vertebral column under a commitology procedure."
"On feed ban, I accept Amendments Nos 22 and 42."
"I can partly accept Amendments Nos 21 and 57 on condition that the possibility of extending the feed ban is allowed, irrespective of risk status."
"I also partly accept Amendment No 54 to Annex V, laying down the detailed rules on the extended feed ban."
"I cannot accept the derogation for dicalcium phosphate, as this is against our scientific advice."
"I also cannot accept the limitation of extending the feed ban to any species, mainly pet animals, only if a risk of cross-contamination of livestock feed exists, as we believe that ruminant protein should be banned for all susceptible species."
"I identify cats here in particular."
"That is the advice I have been given in relation to cats."
"I can partly accept Amendment No 50 to Annex V where it exempts gelatine from hides from the ban."
"However, I cannot accept the exemption for feeding cats with ruminant protein from the ban."
"I also cannot accept Amendment No 23 to Article 9, ensuring immediate application of the feed prohibitions, as this amendment does not fully make sense legally."
"On disease eradication: I accept Amendments Nos 25 and 28."
"I also welcome Amendment No 24 to Article 11, but propose to reformulate, providing for ""regular"" rather than ""immediate"" notification."
"I can also partly accept Amendment No 26 to Article 13 and Amendment No 43 to Annex VII, introducing whole-herd slaughter for BSE in cattle, sheep and goats and, secondly, excluding research animals from these provisions."
"Whole-herd slaughter for BSE only, not for scrapie, is acceptable to me on condition of approval of equivalent measures by commitology."
"I cannot accept the second part of this amendment as it is in fact superfluous."
"I can partly accept Amendment No 44 on condition that the equivalent measures are approved on a case-by-case basis under commitology."
"I do not accept Amendment No 27 to Article 13, requiring a complete standstill on a holding with a confirmed TSE case, as I consider the extremely strict conditions of our proposals are already sufficient, as they require measures to be taken under strict, official veterinary supervision, duly certified."
"I also cannot accept Amendment No 37 to Annex II, as the proposed definition is not used elsewhere in the text and is, in addition, inadequate for TSE control purposes."
"I should add that ADNS regions are too small and too difficult to control."
"Bigger regions which are legally defined may be possible, for instance the Azores, and I refer to what Mr Nicholson said earlier about Northern Ireland."
"On the conditions for marketing animals: we welcome the intention of Amendment No 53 to Article 16."
"However, I propose to reformulate the text to ensure approval of the equivalent schemes by commitology."
"I also welcome the intention of Amendment No 45 to Annex VIII, but would ask for flexibility to determine the exact duration of the scrapie-free period."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 55 to Annex VIII, reducing the protection measures against scrapie."
"Furthermore, I cannot accept Amendment No 46 to Annex VIII, extending the ban on placing on the market offspring of TSE cases, for lack of scientific support."
"Finally, on laboratory techniques, I accept Amendments Nos 47 and 48."
"Thank you again for your cooperation."
"I sincerely hope that this will continue to be a hugely important proposal and that we shall continue our cooperation on it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Organisation of working time"
"The next item is the report (A5-0129/2000), on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council directive 93/104/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time to cover sectors and activities excluded from that directive [C5-0183//2000 - 1998/0318(COD)]."
"As President for today' s sitting, it is my honour to inaugurate a new procedure."
"Before giving the floor to our rapporteur, Mrs Smet, we are going to hear from Mr Provan in his capacity as chairman of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee."
"Mr President, as you say, this is a new procedure and I hope that it helps to establish in Parliament the importance of the conciliation procedure in achieving legislation to which Parliament has aspired."
"I want to say today how much I enjoyed the support and the great help of the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee."
"Mrs Smet, our rapporteur, was President of the Council of Ministers when the original Working Time Directive was enacted."
"Mr Rocard is a former very well-known French minister and indeed Prime Minister."
"We had an exceedingly strong team which Parliament was able to deploy in the negotiations with the Council and I am extremely grateful to both of them. Parliament should be extremely grateful to both of them - especially the rapporteur for all the work that she put into this negotiation."
"The delegation also had a great responsibility in this negotiation because we had many difficult decisions to take."
"We did not achieve everything that we wanted to achieve as a Parliament, but I think we went a long way towards helping all those people who are now going to be included within the Working Time Directive to see some progress so that they can eventually get to the goal that we were all trying to achieve."
"If we take, for instance, the junior doctors, we discover that Parliament originally wanted a six-year period in which to achieve the 48 hours."
"That was never likely to be negotiated with the Council, but we were able to make substantial progress from the Council's original proposal of 13 years."
"Indeed, we finished up with a nine-year period."
"Only in extreme circumstances will governments be able to go through a procedure to justify an extension of that period of nine years."
"The interesting thing in this aspect is that we are making real progress on reducing the time of work for junior doctors."
"As many people will be aware, today, many junior doctors are working 72 hours in some countries."
"The progress that we are making is that in the first three years, the junior doctors' hours will be reduced to 58 and over the following two years to 56 hours and 52 hours respectively."
"We see that the junior doctors are, in fact, going to get a great benefit from this extension to the directive."
"We also were able to clarify the position regarding the classification of mobile workers."
"The case was argued that, for instance, somebody driving a lorry for a large retail store should be included in retail-type legislation for working time, and only genuine transport workers are now going to fall exclusively within the transport sector."
"That, I think, was another major achievement for Parliament in this negotiation."
"We move on to the fishermen who were greatly concerned by the application of this directive to their working life because they felt they would not be able to operate properly within that system."
"In all honour to everybody concerned in the negotiation, the Council and all Members of the delegation, they have made real progress and I recommend the outcome of the conciliation process to the House and hope they support it."
"Thank you, Mr Provan."
"I think we can in fact thank all the Members of Parliament that were involved in this conciliation procedure."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the President, Mr Provan, for his kind words, but particularly for the way in which he, together with Mr Rocard, has presided over and guided the entire process."
"I would also like to thank all the delegates, as it would indeed be impossible to find a compromise on a number of difficult and sensitive issues, if it was not for the fact that everyone moderated their demands, and this is what eventually happened. My thanks go to all of you."
"The vote in the European Parliament tomorrow and in the Council the day after will provisionally end a decade of European legislation concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time."
"I am adding ""provisionally"" , because although a number of sectors and activities are already covered by conclusive horizontal legislation, the vertical rules are still pending."
"The best way to establish these vertical rules is via collective labour agreements, but if these collective labour agreements are not forthcoming, then the Commission will need to take the initiative and propose draft directives."
"This has already happened in the case of road transport."
"The European Parliament has made its position clear but it appears that the Council is unable to adopt the common position."
"This is intolerable, really intolerable, because road transport is one of the key sectors, there are many difficulties within that sector and because so many accidents happen within the Member States due to a lack of legislation and control."
"I would call on the Council and both sides of industry finally to resolve this matter."
"Since no draft directive has been proposed for inland shipping yet, I would ask the Commission to work on that."
"Fortunately, agreements have now been concluded within aviation, navigation at sea and also rail transport, which have been translated into directives. Like rail transport, the sea-fishing and off-shore sectors, as well as the activities of junior doctors, fall within the scope of the directive which we are discussing today."
"For the sea-fishing sector, the European Parliament managed to secure a maximum working week of 48 hours, over a twelve-month reference period."
"Exemptions are only possible under a collective labour agreement or following consultation involving both sides of industry."
"It is indeed necessary to provide for these exemptions, because not only do sea fishermen stay at sea for extended periods of time, in certain countries even 3 000 hours on average annually, they also carry out heavy work at what is by far the most mobile of workplaces."
"Regarding junior doctors, I would refer to what Mr Provan said, because he explained quite clearly what we eventually achieved."
"The main thing is that those countries that want a transitional period in excess of nine years will need to follow a very demanding procedure in order to achieve this."
"The reason why they want to have an extended transitional period and the decision which is eventually taken have to be published in the EU' s Official Journal."
"I hope that this procedure will create a disincentive for those countries because we do not intend to carry on applying the number of working hours prescribed for longer than nine years."
"In 1993, when I, in the capacity of President of the Council, signed the directive concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time, I was aware that the Commission' s proposal of 1990 did not exclude any sectors or activities."
"But at the time, it appeared impossible for the Council to draw up a directive which covered all employees in all sectors and activities."
"Hence the Commission proposed to take a separate and additional initiative for the benefit of those sectors and activities which were excluded from the Council' s directive."
"That culminated in the 1997 White Paper and the 1998 consultation paper and communication."
"The present directive is the first to be born out of negotiations in a Conciliation Committee within the framework of the European social policy, with the European Parliament acting as co-legislator."
"The power of codecision proved to be decisive."
"I think we owe our success, the fact that we eventually reached a sound compromise, to Parliament, among other things, which in its wisdom, only tabled a few amendments."
"Indeed, had we found ourselves in a conciliation procedure faced with 30 or 40 amendments tabled by Parliament, it would have been extremely difficult ever to reach a compromise."
"In this case, we managed to keep the procedure within bounds."
"As such, the European Parliament gave evidence of a legislative maturity, which the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference, in particular, would do well not to lose sight of."
"Mr President, as British Conservatives, we have always opposed the Working Time Directive."
"The idea that politicians in Brussels or Strasbourg should determine how many hours different people work across Europe is, we believe, fundamentally daft."
"To extend it to groups such as offshore oil workers and sea fishermen is particularly so."
"However, because of the special issue of over-worked junior doctors in the UK, as Conservative MEPs we voted last November to extend the directive to them."
"We very much hoped that this would pressure national governments - especially our own - to produce a better deal."
"Certainly Parliament as a whole was of similar mind, hence the Conciliation Committee on which I was privileged to serve."
"I extend congratulations to you, Mr President, in your former capacity as president of that conciliation group - plus Mrs Smet and Mr Rocard."
"I believe in the circumstances we could not have done any better, but those three played a major role in that."
"I should briefly like to mention a point made by some of my colleagues from that delegation."
"I hope other nationals will forgive me if I mention only other British colleagues, for a reason that will become apparent."
"The first speaker in the main meeting was Mr Hughes."
"I am not known for agreeing with him regularly but I congratulate him on the intensity of what he said which set the meeting off to a very good start."
"He was followed by Mrs Lynne - also due to speak today - who reinforced what was said with great vigour."
"I mention that because, when it came to my turn to speak, it enabled me, as a British delegate from a third party, to speak in support, despite the fact that all three parties have many different policies on different issues."
"The fact that I could say that on this issue we were speaking as one and it was a cross-party alliance hopefully helped to reinforce the overall message and the will of Parliament."
"One of my colleagues afterwards said that point was a powerful intervention."
"Certainly it was meant to be."
"Imagine my disappointment after the meeting when an official came up to me and said that while I was making those points on behalf of Parliament another Member also from the UK was busy shaking his head negatively the whole time that I was speaking."
"That will not have strengthened our case."
"It may or may not have made any difference but certainly it will not have done the Parliamentary delegation any good service."
"A few weeks later, we did the best that we could."
"It will be presented - as you, President, have already presented it - as ""nine years""."
"But it is, as you know, nine years, plus two years, plus one year."
"The UK Government will add that up to twelve years as against the 13 years which the UK Government was asking for initially."
"Having only got what we consider minor concessions, we can confirm that, as British Conservatives, we neither support the Working Time Directive nor its extension to any other grouping."
"We still support a better deal for junior doctors; we will still continue to pressure our own government to provide it, but a directive from the European Parliament is clearly not the right way to secure it."
"I would like to begin by echoing previous speakers and adding my words of thanks to the rapporteur and to our chairman and to you for the magnificent work you did in that conciliation."
"The progress we achieved is in large part thanks to the formidable effort and attention to detail the rapporteur put in to this."
"There are three main issues which I would like to concentrate on in the brief time available to me."
"In the original working time directive we had agreed way back in 1993 that it would be possible to introduce annualisation of working time for categories of workers, but only where collective agreements allowed that to happen."
"The first two points I would like to make relate to categories of workers where we have managed to achieve that progress in the conciliation."
"As far as offshore workers and mobile workers in the transport sector are concerned - there was an attempt in the common position to allow annualisation of working time for those workers without collective agreement."
"Thanks to conciliation, collective agreement will now need to be the route for an extension to annualisation."
"That was an important point of progress."
"The second point concerns sea-fishing."
"There we have now built in to the directive the principle that a 48-hour average working week over a period of one year will be the rule."
"That can be subject to derogation but again only after attempts to broker collective agreements to involve the social partners."
"That should be the rule wherever there is an attempt to introduce annualisation and that principle has been safeguarded as a result of the conciliation."
"The third area I want to concentrate on - and it is what other speakers have mentioned - relates to junior doctors."
"Looking at this part of the agreement without detailed knowledge of the negotiations that went into it, it must seem like a very strange animal."
"A four-year transposition period - five years transition and then the possibility of extra time beyond that."
"But of course that was to take account of the special difficulties facing one or two Member States. I would repeat what other speakers have said: for us the period in question is nine years."
"That will be the normal period within which Member States will be expected to comply with the requirements of this directive in relation to junior doctors."
"That is why the procedure to go beyond that into what we might term extra time is so open - in a way humiliating for any government that attempts to take that step."
"I think that in fact we will see all Member States complying with that section of the directive relating to junior doctors within that nine-year time frame."
"I am confident, speaking today, that will be the case."
"A further important point might have been missed."
"The provisions relating to nine years for junior doctors only relate to the average working week."
"The other provisions of the directive relating to daily and weekly rest breaks, annual leave and nightwork will, of course, apply to junior doctors after a three-year transposition period just as they do for all other workers."
"Those parts of the directive can, of course, be subject to derogation but only by collective agreement so those elements will apply to junior doctors."
"The sections dealing with annual leave cannot be negotiated away and it is important to bear that in mind: i.e. the nine years for junior doctors applies only to working time - average weekly working time - and the other provisions of the directive apply after three years."
"The final point I would like to make relates to the transport dossier."
"It is very important that we get movement in that area in the Transport Council."
"Maybe the Commissioner has some news for us today."
"There was an agreement in the rail sector that the provisions of the working time directive would apply in that sector so long as there was parallel progress in other transport sectors, particularly the road sector."
"Unless we get progress in that sector, I am quite certain we are going to see a problem for the rail sector."
"The agreement will not be implemented in the near future at national level."
"Mr President, I would also like to add my thanks to Mrs Smet in particular for doing an excellent job of work on the working time directive and also, of course, to Mr Rocard and to you, yourself."
"I would agree with Philip Bushill-Matthews as well."
"I think the strength of having all-party support throughout the UK on our delegation was very, very useful."
"I would like to talk specifically about junior doctors."
"I am very pleased that they are going to be brought in line with the working time directive."
"There are 270 000 junior doctors across the EU who will be affected by this."
"50.1% in my constituency work over 72 hours a week as do 10 000 in the UK as a whole."
"You can see from those figures that it is extremely important that all Member States actually meet those objectives and I mean the nine-year objective."
"The present situation is not good for patients or doctors alike - they have our life in their hands."
"We would not want to be treated by a drunken doctor and I do not believe that we should be treated by an over-tired doctor."
"Evidence proves that somebody who is impaired by tiredness is impaired in the same way as drunkenness."
"The British Medical Association was saying that 15% of junior doctors were leaving the profession citing stress, overwork and length of hours."
"A lot of those were going to Australia and New Zealand where the working practices were better."
"We have to stop that drain."
"The nine-year timetable, of course, is an improvement on what the Council of Ministers wanted."
"It is made up of four years' implementation and five years to bring down the working time from 58 to 48 hours."
"It is far better than what the Council wanted which was the 13-year period."
"I, of course, would have preferred a shorter time."
"As I have said before, our life is in their hands and it is important that we get this right."
"The UK Government, of course, was part of the problem."
"They maintain that they cannot achieve the reduction in this timescale."
"I believe that they are wrong and that is why we have the extension for two years and also the extension after that for one year."
"But as everyone else has said, it has to be in exceptional circumstances."
"There must be rigorous notification and justification procedures and I hope that the British Government, and other Member State governments who feel that they can delay further by seeking two years and then another will feel so embarrassed that they will not seek to do so and meet the goal in nine years."
"It is not twelve years - it is nine years and we must state that very, very clearly."
"It is long enough - I would have liked it to have been shorter, but let us hope the governments, and the British Government in particular, adhere to that."
"Mr President, I must apologise for this appearing to be a British show at this moment."
"I assure you that it does change with the next speaker."
"I also would like to thank Mrs Smet, our rapporteur, for the excellent work that she has done throughout this entire process."
"With the support that she has received from Mr Rocard and from yourself, she has managed to make progress in face of the tensions between the high expectations of those whose lives will be affected by these decisions, some six million workers, and the difficulties and some intransigence presented by certain Member States."
"I speak as my group's representative on that parliamentary delegation and I know what I have seen."
"This is a health and safety issue, as has been said, for both the workers concerned and for the public."
"While I recognise, like others, that junior doctors are not the only group affected, this issue has proved the most difficult."
"I have been deeply concerned at some of the arguments put forward by certain governments which have said that other aspects of health provision could be threatened if the reduction of working time for this group was brought in more quickly."
"I cannot understand why it is less important for these workers to have reasonable working conditions and hours than any other group of health workers."
"I want to know whether junior doctors in some countries are some sort of superhuman who can do without adequate rest and who will not harm their own health or that of their patients in the process."
"The mother of one such trainee doctor said to me recently that she had been writing to the British Prime Minister and his wife, Tony and Cherie, to ask if they would be happy if their new baby were to be delivered by a tired, stressed-out doctor in a semi-drunken condition as that described by Mrs Lynne."
"I consider that would be a real health and safety issue requiring rapid action."
"As we have all said, we must be clear that nine years has to be seen as an absolute limit, that anything more is an aberration."
"Any country not managing that should not be surprised if they find their staff moving elsewhere, to countries which have managed to implement more modern working conditions."
"The stepped approach which has been brought in must not be used to simply give a redefinition of working time such as removing meal breaks or time spent on call but not actually treating patients."
"That would simply be following the bad practices recently tried out by certain burger chains. However, at least some of those chains pay their part-time 17-year-old staff more per hour than some junior doctors get in overtime payment."
"I would like to congratulate in advance those Member States that will meet their obligations under this directive for all sectors."
"The progress of others will be monitored very carefully."
"I acknowledge the Commission's role in this and hope that the Commissioner at that time will show the same commitment as that shown by Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"Regretfully I am not sure that my group will be able to fully support the proposals overall despite the improvements that Mrs Smet and the Parliament team have been able to obtain in this very difficult situation."
"Mr President, I too want to thank and congratulate Mrs Smet on an excellent piece of work in the Conciliation Committee and also on her report."
"I also want to thank other key people such as Mr Provan and Mr Rocard."
"They have played an important role."
"The Parliamentary delegation was basically very much in agreement, even though we differed in our willingness to compromise when it came to the crunch."
"It was, of course, important to solve problems."
"The idea was that seven million people should be brought within the scope of the directive."
"When I learned that the whole thing was to go off without a hitch, that is to say that there was to be an agreement, I nonetheless took the liberty of voting against."
"I wanted to make the point that, in spite of everything, I was not satisfied with everything in this compromise."
"I was especially critical of the agreement when it came to the issue of young doctors."
"If the decision is interpreted as it already has been by some people in this debate, namely as saying that the transposition and transitional periods for doctors should add up to nine years and that there should, above and beyond that, be the possibility of an additional three years' extra time, then we arrive at a total period of twelve years."
"This is really little different from the Council' s position, involving thirteen years."
"There was, therefore, not so much of a compromise on that particular point."
"I think this is a serious matter, because it is about patients having to suffer and about doctors being placed in impossible situations, from both moral and personal points of view."
"Young doctors do not choose these working conditions and working hours but are forced to accept them."
"I thought it was appropriate for at least someone in this Parliament to use his voting right for the purpose of indicating this dissatisfaction."
"I now hope to see the three extra years become a facility which cannot be counted upon but which is only granted in really exceptional cases."
"The intention expressed by this Chamber has, of course, been that, where junior doctors are concerned, the period for implementing the present directive should be nine years and that the three extra years should only apply in extreme and exceptional cases."
"Naturally, we hope that, in reality, the process will be still more rapid."
"We also want, in the future, to see the working time directive apply to those groups which have still not been brought within its scope."
"In common with Mr Hughes, I should like to ask the Commission a question regarding these groups. How far has the work progressed when it comes to the transport sector and lorry drivers?"
"I want to conclude by saying that, on more than one occasion, the European Parliament has shown itself to be a significant force where working time legislation in Europe is concerned."
"I hope that this will continue."
"It is not just a question of establishing longest permitted working times but of a good deal else besides."
"There are ever more differences in the way in which working time is distributed in our society."
"For young families, the difficulty of reconciling full-time work with family and children is becoming ever greater."
"Working time puts the squeeze on women and children, in particular."
"It is also an issue relating to age and to where one is in one' s life."
"Young and old have different needs and different abilities."
"We need a whole series of changes to working time policy, and it is my hope that it will be possible for the European Parliament to come back with more initiatives in this area."
"Mr President, I join in the congratulations to all involved with this matter."
"Rather than reiterate what other colleagues have said, I think the core issue is the junior doctors in training."
"Obviously, whilst nine years is not the perfect solution which Parliament originally sought, it is the best possible compromise."
"It is incumbent on us to send out a clear message that we would expect every government in the European Union to comply fully with the nine years."
"Even though I know there are rigorous tests and standards as to whether or not an extension would be granted, it should only be granted in the most exceptional circumstances and not for any willy-nilly ideology."
"In addition, as Mr Hughes pointed out, the other parts of the entitlements come into force immediately."
"Even though the overall reduction in working hours may be postponed for some time, the actual rest-period times and so on come into force immediately."
"I shall just deal very briefly with two other points concerning the whole working time directive."
"Firstly, concerning fishermen, there is some attempt to compromise within the proposals before us."
"However, it is a notoriously difficult area to enforce because of outside conditions, such as bad weather, that will affect the way fishermen operate."
"Perhaps we should review this at some stage in the near future and look at it anew to try to come up with a better solution."
"Secondly, transport workers: when we already have tachograph legislation in place, why do we need to bring in a separate and new directive on transport workers, in particular lorry drivers and so on?"
"Perhaps now is the time to look at this afresh."
"New technology - in particular digital tachographs and individual smart cards for individual drivers on the tachograph - could be the best way to regulate the hours during which drivers are on the road and at work."
"It will also ensure that they can have equal benefits with every other worker in the Union."
"Finally, I wish to pay my compliments once again to Mrs Smet."
"I have one small, further request to the Commissioner."
"Perhaps now is the time, after we have agreed this conciliation and brought this new piece of legislation into being, to carry out an impact assessment on how the existing legislation is working, whether it is of benefit to the workers - increasing their health and safety - and whether it is increasing employment, which is one of the original arguments behind it."
"Mr President, I too would like to convey my heartfelt thanks to everyone who took part in the negotiations on our side, especially the rapporteur but also you yourself and Mr Rocard, as well as other members of the negotiation delegation."
"I would like also to extend warm thanks to the Commission, particularly for their declaration on working on Sundays."
"This was a major obstacle for us, mainly because the Commission had skirted this thorny issue a little too easily in the past."
"The declaration was therefore a great help to us."
"I would like to say one thing to the representatives of the GUE/NGL Group and the Greens."
"If you vote against this compromise - and I would understand if you did, because I myself find nine years for junior doctors far too long - you will then be against everything, in effect."
"If this line were to be taken across the board, and if Parliament were to say ""no"" , then we would not have a solution in nine years, or ninety years."
"If it were up to the British Government - we heard this quite clearly in the negotiations - it could well be 50 years and maybe longer before they resolve this issue."
"The first problem was that they appeared unable to train a sufficient number of doctors."
"If, therefore, you do not train sufficient doctors, you need to obtain them from other countries."
"If this plan fails too, then the whole procedure could take a very long time."
"If this is not something you want, then you need to approve this directive now, obviously with the reservation that it is an empty exercise - I am still convinced of this - and junior doctors should not need to be in this exemption position at all."
"That is the problem."
"I have one question for the Commission."
"It concerns the other matters at issue, specifically that of transport."
"I would like to know how the Commission intends to deal with this."
"It is now up to the Commission."
"The working time directive will not be complete until these issues have been resolved."
"The ball is now quite clearly in the Commission' s court."
"The Transport Council is behaving badly."
"Transport conjures up images of action and movement, but the Transport Council must be the most inactive of all councils and does absolutely nothing."
"I wonder if the Commission can think of a way to resolve this."
"Failing this, Mr President, we should seriously consider taking legal action against the Transport Council, as was done very successfully a couple of years ago before the Court."
"More of this later."
"Finally, Mr President, one of the first people to propose working time legislation was Winston Churchill."
"That was a key moment in history, not only in the history of Great Britain, but also in the history of Europe as a whole, because in the Netherlands too, we adopted this legislation without questioning it."
"That makes it all the easier to bring this directive about."
"We thus have the feeling that we are in a way completing Winston Churchill' s work with this directive, especially if we bear in mind that he did at least manage to bring a terrible war to a successful end in five years, while the present British Government would not even be capable of resolving the problem of junior doctors in 50 years."
"He - more than anyone - should be in our thoughts when dealing with this subject matter."
"Mr President, for me it has been a real privilege - and a surprise - to attend this conciliation procedure and to witness first hand the resistance and difficulties we have had to face in order to make progress."
"This is demonstrated by the excellent work of Mrs Smet, and also Mr Provan and Mr Rocard."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, her department and so many people - also the Portuguese Presidency - who have allowed Parliament, like Churchill, to set a milestone in the construction of a social and more humanitarian Europe."
"I am convinced that there is another reason for recommending that Parliament vote in favour of this report: the difficulties we have faced in making progress with regard to certain governments."
"I will be truly happy to see these sectors, which were excluded from the 1993 directive, provided with a recognised European regulation on working time, even if it does involve long and protracted timescales."
"However, we should not be dazzled by the light."
"There is no doubt that public opinion - and I too am concerned about this public opinion - does not understand why these procedures are so slow and why, with regard to the problem of young doctors or fishermen, we have not been able to make any progress."
"It is not acceptable - since we all agree that we cannot continue to ask these young doctors to work these exhausting hours and that we cannot continue to put our patients at risk - that we have not been able to make speedier progress."
"I hope that, in fact, the timescale will be nine years and not thirteen years, although it pains me to say that, as a Spaniard, I feel restricted by the fact that it has been my government which has insisted most on having this additional period."
"They may have requested this additional period, but we should take great care to ensure that they do not use it."
"Lastly, I would like to ask the Commissioner and the Commission, to monitor closely the application of the directive, so that in nine years time they do not ask for three more."
"Mr President, in previous debates here last November and in April of this year I supported the general principles behind the idea of directives on working time and I still do so."
"Clearly there are significant health and safety issues which can be addressed - not only for the protection of workers but also for the protection of their customers and the general public - and issues of customer health and safety of course are particularly relevant in relation to doctors in training."
"Like my colleague, Mrs Lambert, I am concerned that this compromise has not gone quite far enough in relation to doctors' hours."
"There would remain though some workers in some working places where practical issues do not readily lend themselves to the implementation of this type of directive."
"Coming from Scotland, with one of the largest EU fishing fleets, I would like once again to focus on the problem of fisheries and the defining of working time."
"I note the compromise concerning sea-fishermen - a maximum of 48 hours of weekly work in a reference period of 12 months and the possibility of derogation after consultation and by agreement."
"This may be an improvement but I still have some questions to put to the Commission."
"We have to recognise that there were good reasons for the initial exclusion of the fisheries sector."
"As regards fishing there is a deep-seated suspicion of Brussels in many respects and a lot of opposition to the whole idea of fishermen being told when to sleep or when to go to sea, given that their working time is governed by uncontrollable factors such as climatic conditions and the movement of shoals of fish."
"The directive says that work at sea comprises sea fishing and other offshore work."
"Many fishermen, particularly in Scotland, are organised on a family basis - they are share-fishermen paid only a proportion of their vessel's catch."
"They are clearly not employees in the sense of the word that we would understand."
"Is this directive going to affect them or is it not?"
"I have asked the Commission this question previously in committee and in plenary and have not yet received absolute clarification of this point."
"The Conciliation Committee concluded in the case of those share fishermen who are employees - a statement which seems to me to be contradictory - that it is for Member States to determine the conditions for entitlement to annual leave and payments etc, but there is no explanation as to whether or when a share fisherman is employed."
"I know for sure that the fishermen that I see around the coast of Scotland can only be defined as self-employed and I stress the need for clarification of this."
"There are huge differences between a large-scale long-distance fleet where fishermen are employed by companies and sent off for months on end and the smaller- and medium-sized boats, which operate on a family or a cooperative basis."
"This is an issue about the definition of self-employment or owner operation and I know that the compromise deletes own-account transport operators, clearly and quite properly identifying an exception in that area."
"I call for a similar exception for share-fishermen."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is crucial that all employees are assured a decent working environment in order to guarantee that their health and safety is protected, which requires an organisation of working time that allows daily and weekly rest breaks, annual leave, holidays and other aspects."
"This is why an appropriate solution must be found to the problem of all workers in activities that were excluded from the scope of Directive 93, specifically in the area of transport, fishing and the activities of junior doctors."
"The truth is that, despite a positive proposal by Parliament, which sought to respond to these issues, the Council has insisted on an unacceptable position. This substantially reduces the initial proposals of the European Parliament, specifically the increase of the period for transposing the directive to all sectors from two to three years."
"The only exception made concerns junior doctors, for whom the period is extended from four to nine and possibly to twelve years. Apart from anything else, this also threatens the safety of the patients themselves who are examined by doctors who work excessively long hours."
"That is why we have voted against this agreement, since what we want, of course, is a better agreement."
"It was never going to be easy to satisfy all of the interested parties who have lobbied and worked closely with the Union institutions to bring about amendments to the 1993 directive."
"This is the new directive, of course, and I am pleased that it has been extended to offshore workers, fishermen and doctors in training."
"The most contentious part of the directive was bound to relate to doctors in training who would benefit from this piece of legislation."
"One should recall that the Council had originally proposed an exemption for a period of some 13 years before doctors in training would secure the benefits of the directive."
"Naturally, Parliament put forward its own proposals to support the right of doctors in training to be covered by this directive after a period of 4 years."
"Hence the conciliation procedure which you, Mr President, were involved in."
"But whatever honeyed words are attached to the conclusions of the procedure, the bottom line is that junior doctors will not secure benefits for a period of nine years at least."
"According to the conclusions of the Conciliation Committee, junior doctors will secure benefits after a transitional period of five years and a four-year transposition period."
"I fully support the right of junior doctors and doctors in training to secure the benefits of this directive, but the Conciliation Committee conclusions will have reluctantly to be accepted."
"I would like in conclusion to refer to one small but very important matter, namely that under exceptional circumstances there may be a further extension of two years and indeed up to three years if governments argue that the reduction would cause real administrative difficulties."
"I do hope that this directive can be implemented sooner rather than later."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, working time policy - as we can see once again - is not economic policy, it is health and safety at work policy."
"When used preventively, it saves the state and the economy a great deal of money."
"I have completely failed to understand in this debate why a reasonable set of rules was not adopted back in 1993, especially as the Commission and Parliament did not want any derogations even then."
"Seven million workers were affected and specific sectors, such as the mobile worker sector, have been subject to ruinous competition over recent years, especially in Germany."
"It is therefore also a social problem and it is not enough, Mr Crowley, to use tachographs or other technical aids."
"One does not exclude the other."
"We also need a framework directive, because the employees who are affected have been working in a grey zone for a long time now."
"They had no rules, they were not covered by a collective agreement, they were exploited and some also engaged in self-exploitation."
"We know that this overload sometimes gave rise to alcohol-related problems."
"Parliament has shown sufficient flexibility; Mrs Smet highlighted our legislative maturity."
"I think, Mrs Smet, you have proven that we can also fight."
"The results are acceptable."
"I am trying to muster support, even if we have not achieved everything we wanted to."
"But the transition period and the graduated plan are the maximum we have allowed the Council."
"I hope that no government will use up the full period of time and am counting on constructive competition between the Member States to see which State will be the first to implement the proposals from Parliament and the Commission."
"Directive 93/104 was already very restrictive as far as worker production is concerned."
"It does not harmonise social legislation upwards, quite the opposite."
"It establishes a European framework which falls a long way short of workers' expectations: an 11-hour daily rest period, a 48-hour working week, a 24-hour weekly break."
"What is more, a number of categories were excluded from its field of competence."
"We find the compromise, which Parliament is to vote on today following the meetings of the Conciliation Committee, unsatisfactory in terms of both the health and the safety of workers."
"It makes flexibility more widespread, particularly for sea fishermen, establishing the systematic annualisation of reference periods."
"It will permit further exemptions to the already excessive legislation of 48 hours per week."
"Finally, it will take nine years, in the best possible case, for the working week of doctors in training to be reduced from 58 hours to 48."
"In fact, the proposed working time organisation institutes social deregulation at the very time when, in France, doctors in training are campaigning for decent working conditions and genuine safety for service-users."
"Proper organisation of working time would entail, we reiterate, a real reduction in working hours accompanied by moves to create a sufficient number of jobs."
"We cannot support this report as it stands."
"Mr President, this proposal will bring an additional seven million workers in Europe under the protection of the Working Time Directive, allowing them to have reasonable working conditions and proper rest periods."
"However, to get a 48-hour week, junior doctors must wait nine years minimum and possibly twelve years."
"I will not pretend to be happy with this situation."
"It is, however, the best that we could achieve if we were to end once and for all the Council's delaying tactics."
"It has been obvious since 1993 that those excluded from the directive at that time would eventually come under its protection."
"One has to ask, therefore, why over that seven-year period virtually nothing was done in Ireland or in Britain to bring the number of doctors forward that would be needed to implement it."
"In Ireland some junior doctors work over 100 hours per week, the average being 70 to 80."
"Only last night they suspended strike action which they had threatened because they have now reached an interim agreement which will ensure that they are actually paid for the overtime they work."
"In some cases they were not paid at all, in some cases only half the normal rate. Some progress has been made and no doubt the conclusion of the conciliation has helped them in that regard."
"Through the Council of Ministers both Britain and Ireland fought tooth-and-nail to slow the process down."
"That was unfortunate."
"The working arrangements for junior doctors are like a horror story from a Dickensian novel of the nineteenth century."
"I find it bizarre that at the beginning of the 21st century we are still arguing for common sense with regard to health and safety."
"I would appeal to all national governments, including Ireland, not to utilise the additional provisions for extending the implementation of this directive beyond the nine-year period and would remind them that it is intended only as an exceptional measure if all other genuine steps have been taken to implement the measures here."
"Mr President, the proposed working time directive for specific categories of worker such as doctors in training, offshore workers or mobile workers, is typical of the slow and derisory nature of social Europe."
"The recitals of the proposal, nonetheless, stress the specific importance of this file, the first major file on social issues, adding, even, that it is a matter of the health and safety of 7 million workers."
"In France, for example, a number of strikes by junior doctors recently drew the attention of public opinion to the intolerable length of the working day for this category of worker, harmful to the doctors in training themselves, but also to the quality of the care they are providing their patients with."
"The same question arises, with at least as much urgency, for other categories such as offshore workers or transport workers."
"What we should have had was a quick decision and an appropriate reduction in working hours. Well, the proposal does intend to cut hours, but by phasing in the cuts."
"For the first three years, 58-hour working weeks are permitted."
"We have to wait 5 years for the maximum working week to be reduced to 48 hours, and the Commission is cynical enough to cite technical reasons in order to grant a further 2-year delay in application."
"Who are they trying to kid that these measures could not come into force almost immediately if there was any political will to act in favour of the interests of the workers concerned rather than favouring the claims of management?"
"Some restriction, even a derisory cut, in working hours is better than no restriction at all."
"We shall not vote against this text, but we shall conclude from this experience that workers can have no expectations of social Europe and that, decidedly, nothing can replace the collective strength of the workers when it comes to amending legislation in favour of the workers."
"Mr President, the chairman of the European Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs could not remain silent in this debate."
"Thank heavens, my fellow Members have already said what needed to be said about the issue itself."
"I shall come back to this point."
"We are not terribly proud of the final result, but I should at least like to pay tribute to it, as some outcome had to be found."
"At this point, I should like to thank Mrs Smet, our efficient and indefatigable rapporteur, and Mr Provan, who was also the persistent and efficient chairman of our Conciliation Committees."
"I should like to thank all our coordinators, Mr Brok, Mr Hughes, Mrs Flautre, Mr Schmid, Mrs Lynne, who demonstrated great understanding in order to reach some sort of outcome."
"I should like to pay tribute to the Commission. Without wishing to embarrass you, Mrs Diamantopoulou, throughout almost all this debate Parliament has had the technical and even political support of the Commission, particularly on the important amendments."
"I have one small correction to make, unless I misunderstood, to what Mrs Smet has just said."
"It is not exactly the first successful conciliation on social matters between the European Parliament and the Council."
"It is the second, following the successful conciliation on the minor issue of workers working in an explosive atmosphere."
"This is, however, an infinitely more wide-ranging issue, of course."
"Mr President, I must point out how unusually tough the Council is to deal with."
"The political truth is that the Parliament team, in an astounding spirit of responsibility and unanimity - and you have witnessed the benign respect which I and Mr Bushill-Matthews, for example, have for each other - was remarkable for its united front as much as for its determination to succeed."
"Parliament made most of the running."
"We are not proud of the result in terms of the content."
"In a real democracy Parliament would have been determining the legislation."
"I would like to remind the Council that we are just as dedicated to achieving results, but that they must not expect Parliament to make quite so many concessions on a regular basis."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to make three political comments."
"I feel that the successful outcome of the conciliation procedure proves that where there is a will, there is a way."
"In order for this conciliation to succeed, we had to take account of the fifteen different systems in the Member States, different fields of work and proposals from various employer and employee federations."
"We also had to take account of the viability of health services as things now stand and competitiveness in sectors such as transport and fisheries."
"This was no mean feat!"
"It has taken six years to achieve today' s result and it is the first major conciliation decision in the social sphere - and I say major because it affects some 5 million workers."
"I feel that the most interesting point - and this is my third comment - is the number of workers affected by this directive, who are at present excluded from the working time directive and who will enjoy these rights once this directive is applied."
"In my view, therefore, we should be satisfied regardless of whether or not this directive meets all our requirements."
"The upshot is that the provisions of the working directive will apply to doctors in training, workers at sea, rail workers and all non-mobile workers in excluded sectors."
"I would like in particular to thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Rocard, the Vice-Chairman, Mr Provan, who used his great experience to guide the conciliation procedure, and of course, Mrs Smet who, with her wealth of ministerial experience, helped achieve such a difficult conciliation."
"I would also like to give special thanks to the Portuguese Presidency and the Member States, particularly those which, for reasons we cannot go into right now, have experienced major problems with their national health services, such as Great Britain, Spain and Ireland."
"Certain speakers raised the issue of the implementation of the directive."
"I should like to stress that it is indeed a particularly important issue."
"One of the Commission' s fundamental duties is to monitor the implementation of directives."
"Here I should like to ask the MEPs to cooperate with us and closely monitor any underhanded plans in Member States, so that the Commission can intervene immediately."
"A further two questions have also been raised, the first by Messrs Hughes, Schmid and Pronk as to what we intend to do in the road and rail transport sectors."
"First, I must tell you that the Transport Council is involved, making the whole process even more complicated."
"Secondly, as for road transport, the Commission tabled a proposal in 1996, but it was blocked by the Council in 1998."
"The Commission intends, with the cooperation of the French Presidency, to re-table the issue."
"We are awaiting new negotiations by the social partners and we hope to obtain their assent."
"If we cannot proceed in this way, we shall have to change the whole approach we have adopted so far."
"With regard to the issue of fisheries, the matter was raised once again by Mr Hudghton."
"We have discussed this in the past."
"I will try to clarify it."
"I am afraid I was not clear enough."
"So I would like to repeat that the issue of self-employment in fisheries is not included in this directive."
"The self-employed in fisheries is a matter of national competence."
"That is very clear and very precise."
"I thank you very much for all your support and help during these discussions, and that of your services."
"It is very much appreciated indeed."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Reviewing aid to third countries"
"The next item is the Commission communication - Reviewing aid to third countries."
"Mr President, I hope Parliament will excuse me if shortly after making a brief presentation I have to leave, but this is, as Parliament knows, very much the collective work of the RELEX Commissioners as a whole and very much the shared work of my colleague, Commissioner Nielson and myself."
"Commissioner Nielson will still be here to make his own contribution to this report and to answer any questions which may arise."
"The function I have to attend is a joint meeting of two committees which was specially arranged to discuss a number of external assistance issues so I hope Parliament will be understanding."
"I think it is fair to say that the proposals that we have put forward go right to the heart of the issues that are raised in the White Paper on reform and it is extremely important for us to demonstrate that the reform of our external assistance programmes is the flagship or one of the flagships, for an overall reform process."
"People occasionally get a little bored when one talks about internal procedures but what they should recognise is what we are discussing in these particular proposals: ways in which, first of all, we can get assistance to people more rapidly and effectively and, secondly, ways in which we can change the image of the European Union around the world."
"All of us have, alas, experienced too frequently occasions when instead of us getting the credit for what we are trying to do on behalf of Europe's taxpayers, we get blamed for not doing it a lot more effectively and a lot more rapidly."
"I hope that is a problem which we will be able to tackle."
"Very briefly, it is worth reminding ourselves what the background to this issue is."
"We have seen a threefold increase in external assistance commitments managed by the SCR over the last 10 years."
"That has been driven by events and by political pressures; a recognition of the responsibilities we should discharge in Central and Eastern Europe - the recognition which that triggered of our responsibilities in the Mediterranean."
"It is worth noting that our assistance programmes in the Mediterranean have increased four and a half times since 1990."
"Then there is the Balkans crisis where the attempts to put in place a common foreign and security policy are being particularly tested."
"While our external assistance programmes themselves have grown very rapidly, staff resources have failed to keep pace. The Commission has 2.9 staff for every EUR 10 million that we manage."
"That compares with an average figure about twice that for Member States - the figure is 5.7 but it goes as high as 9 for some Member States and 4.2 for the World Bank."
"One of the consequences of that has been the increasing use of technical assistance offices which has been much criticised by Parliament and by the Court of Auditors on the grounds of weak monitoring and a lack of political control."
"It is worth noting that we have spent about EUR 170 million a year on the 80 technical assistance offices which is equivalent to the cost of 800 staff working for the Commission."
"A consequence of all this is that the SCR today has over EUR 21 billion in outstanding commitments awaiting payments."
"That is an embarrassingly large figure."
"I do not blame the staff of the SCR who work extremely hard in very difficult circumstances, but there are not enough of them."
"They have had to operate with extremely difficult procedures."
"They have also had to operate against a background of Member States second, third and fourth guessing every implementation decision that we try to make."
"We have brought forward in the document, which has now been made public, our proposals for dealing with this problem."
"As honourable Members will know, over the years Parliament has put forward a number of proposals including the idea that we should externalise the management of our overseas aid."
"That remains a possibility for the long term though it would take some time because one would first have to get in place the necessary legal framework."
"However my principal concern at the moment is not how we get from A to Z - that often seems rather easier than getting from A to B. What we have to do - whatever the long term objective may be is - to find better ways of managing our external assistance straightaway."
"We have put forward a number of proposals."
"We have put forward proposals for improving programming: making sure that all the RELEX Commissioners share responsibility for programming - we have suggested the reuniting of the project cycle from identification to implementation - we think the present split has not worked well."
"What we propose to do is to create a new implementation body replacing the SCR which we think should be called Europe Aid."
"It would be initially an office under a board made up of all the External Relations Commissioners though, as I say, the option of moving to externalisation in the longer term remains on the table."
"We want to devolve more responsibility to delegations and, where possible, to national authorities in the field."
"We have proposed special treatment for the pre-accession strategy: humanitarian assistance and macro-financial assistance with fully integrated management."
"That means, for example, transferring the residual SCR functions for PHARE to the Directorate-General for Enlargement."
"We have proposed taking urgent measures to tackle the backlog of old and dormant projects."
"We are writing to the relevant chairmen of parliamentary committees and to the Court of Auditors to explain our approach."
"I do not want to go on for very much longer, except to say this: where will the resources come from to manage and run our programmes in the proposed office, Europe Aid, rather better in the future than we have managed in the past?"
"We have to take our turn with others in the Commission in arguing our corner in the peer group process for the assistance we think is required to manage our programmes effectively."
"We may, as a result, present the budgetary authority with a rectifying letter to the 2001 budget proposals in September."
"That is for the future."
"The simple point I want to make is this: we cannot go on as we have."
"In my judgement it is simply not an option."
"We have to do better."
"We are not bidding for a bigger empire."
"The budgetary authority will ultimately have to judge the right scale of European Union external aid programmes."
"However, my only aim is to put the Commission in a position where it can run these programmes competently."
"I have to say very bluntly to Parliament that there are two possibilities: either the budgetary authority agrees with our ideas and will then try to implement them from 2001, or else, in order to manage what our programmes amount to more competently, we will be obliged to propose very large cuts."
"We cannot go on in a situation in which we are not prepared to provide the resources to manage effectively the money that is voted by the budgetary authority for our external assistance programmes."
"We have to be prepared to face up to the management and administrative consequences of what we are trying to do around the world, otherwise the people who suffer are those who should be receiving our help to enable them to read and write or live a better and healthier life or create the institutions of good governance in their communities."
"They are the people who suffer as well as the European Union's reputation."
"I am sure this will be a long debate."
"I am sure that Parliament will have a considerable contribution to make to the discussion over the next few months."
"However, my impression after a few months in this job is that Parliament wants as badly as the Commission to deliver a more competently run assistance programme all around the world."
"Mr President, this is refreshing - the fact that the European Union is acknowledging that there are problems but that we have solutions."
"Commissioner Nielson will recall that a couple of months ago I suggested that it might be the case that he could become an emperor without clothes."
"Is it not the case now that this proposal, taking away so much from DG Development as it does, is likely to make my prediction come true?"
"Secondly, at the end of what Commissioner Patten was saying, I think he reiterated what he was quoted as saying in ""The Times"" this morning where he said that Member States should back his plans with resources or cut aid."
"I have to say, Commissioners, that I find this a deeply worrying and dangerous statement and likely to be taken at its face value by Member States and not in the way that you suggest."
"I would very much appreciate clarification of those two questions by one or other Commissioner."
"Mr President, I do not feel like an emperor without clothes, but you can judge for yourself."
"The situation is that we had to do something not just to integrate the project cycle in terms of the line management of activities."
"We also had to do something concerning squaring the circle organisationally giving substance to my political overall responsibility for development policy."
"We have done this without changing the portfolios that were defined."
"The solution we have reached is to create a board of directors which will oversee and politically be the managerial part of running the new office or EuropeAid or whatever SCR is going to be called."
"My role on that board will be that of the chief executive officer. Commissioner Patten will be chairman, reflecting the position he already has at the head of the table being the ultimate coordinator of all RELEX Commissioners' activities."
"We are in a sense structuring the political roles that have been defined and we are doing it in such a way that I think it really does have a chance of functioning."
"There are two elements in this which will contribute to better coherence and better political consistency."
"One is what I have already mentioned with a closer political involvement in the management of the actual implementation."
"The other one is the quality-support group which will have its secretariat in DG Development."
"The role is to make sure that the formulation of the different programmes, including those in DG RELEX, is consistent with the policy and principles that we have defined."
"All in all, I think this is a good attempt at doing things given the way things were defined last July."
"This will also concentrate a lot of attention among all RELEX Commissioners on the problem of whether or not we actually are delivering."
"We have to get out of the culture of commitment and into the culture of delivering."
"What we are doing here will be part of that change."
"We also talk about ownership in our partner countries as being a major problem."
"The reality, because of the way we are organised in the Commission, is that ownership on our side is extremely vague and problematic."
"This is going to change as a consequence of the reform we are putting forward now."
"Finally, I will address the issue of the risk of what happens if we do not get the staff and the resources to do the job."
"Clearly continuing the way things are now is not acceptable, it is not possible."
"We have to make the point as clearly as Commissioner Patten just did which means that we want those resources."
"We have commitments, we have an agreement with 71 ACP states, we have the Member States backing that and accepting the next ninth European Development Fund."
"All this is part of the promises we have made already, so there is really no alternative to getting the people to do the job."
"But how to do it - this is a problem we cannot solve alone, which is why we are appealing as strongly and clearly as we are; and we make no secret of the fact that if the budget authority will not make it possible to get the staff, we will not be able to do the job."
"This is the situation as we see it."
"We do not want to invest our own role as Commissioners in fighting a losing battle."
"We want to fight a battle we can be proud of participating in."
"Mr President, I am very happy to hear that, in order to fulfil commitments, more resources and personnel are required."
"As Parliament is aware of this, we will offer our full support."
"However, I would like to ask a question, since I have not had time to study the document at length. What will happen to humanitarian aid?"
"We understand that the Union' s policy of humanitarian aid does not end with simply granting it, but it has to continue - we talk in this context of a 'continuum' - so that development policies can be carried out."
"Otherwise, we may see a repetition of what is happening in Mozambique at the moment: clearly, humanitarian aid was removed, ECHO disappeared, development policy is no longer being implemented and therefore, violence may erupt once again."
"Within this 'continuum' I would like to know whether, as has been the case until now, ECHO will be an office dependent on the Commission, but whose action will be based on development policies aimed at what we want to see, and that is the eradication of poverty."
"Mr President, it is a shame that Mr Patten had to leave so soon."
"I actually wanted to put my question to him."
"But I think that Mr Nielson is equally well placed to answer me because he has been standing by his colleague' s side and he also said that both Commissioners were responsible for the proposal."
"Mr Nielson, of course we here in Parliament share your aim of providing quicker aid to men and women, and raising the profile of the European Union."
"That goes without saying."
"But we had all agreed that what the Commission wanted to introduce now by way of reform had to be done jointly with us."
"When Mr Patten says in his presentation that either the Commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts, I find that highly displeasing."
"It is we who are the budgetary authority, or at least part of it, and I think that the Commission cannot simply say we shall make cuts or we shall have to make cuts."
"That, if you please, has to go through the budgetary procedure first and what is certain is that you will have to implement your reform programme jointly with us."
"I should like to know what your colleague meant by this threat."
"Mr President, I am very sorry that Commissioner Patten had to leave."
"In his absence I am delighted to direct my questions to the Development Commissioner, Mr Nielson."
"I am delighted to hear of new innovations and reorganisations which the Commission is going to put into place."
"EuropeAid would be a very important attribute of the European Union as far as our external relations are concerned."
"It has been extremely embarrassing so far that some of our promises have not been kept."
"Not keeping promises to the poorest people in the world is not the nicest way to go about - as a rich part of the world - trying to help them."
"Consolidating the RELEX Commissioners and increasing the management support staff and resources have my fullest support."
"I am also delighted to hear that they are planning to create a board very much like the World Bank."
"But I should like to ask Commissioner Nielson if he has thought about something which is very important to this side of the House - the IFC in the World Bank has the ability to help in the private sector with funding."
"Micro-credits and various other mechanisms are key to helping people to help themselves."
"Have they considered extending, in EuropeAid, some element of helping people to help themselves through an investment arm where the European Union becomes a partner in venture and enterprise?"
"Firstly, ECHO is not affected by this reform of development assistance."
"ECHO is going to continue."
"This is clearly part of what we have decided."
"The only issue is to create a better link or bridge between the phase of humanitarian assistance and the more forward-oriented, long-term development assistance."
"This is a well established discussion."
"We want to keep ECHO more or less the way it is."
"I have confidence that with the new director of ECHO we are on track."
"To Mrs Haug I should like to make it clear that Commissioner Patten was saying that we will have to propose deep cuts in the level of activity if we do not get a positive response from the budget authorities concerning the staff issue."
"Why are we saying this as clearly as we are, even running the risk of being interpreted as if issuing a threat?"
"I noticed your choice of word there."
"We think it is necessary to make it clear that we seriously think it is problematic to continue without the resources and the manpower that we need."
"It is not possible to do this well without being more or less organised like other well-performing donors."
"This is the message."
"It may very well be the case that we are being misunderstood in this Parliament because, on this matter, we are definitely among friends."
"So saying it as clearly as we do here may sound wrong. I realise that."
"But there are other elements around."
"We have to say it à tous azimuts."
"It is absolutely necessary to make these measures clear."
"I do not mean to be negative about ministers of finance, but sometimes they can be quite demanding partners in discussion."
"Development ministers are not that unproblematic either."
"The biggest problem is actually the lack of consistency between the level of ambition defined in this field and the resources and tools that we have available to carry out the job."
"This is our biggest problem."
"We will be making a positive effort to get a solution that makes it possible to continue at least at the level of activity that we have now."
"I should like to add that, though it is right to point out the backlog, the problems and the embarrassment, it should not be forgotten that we are building roads out there, thousands of kilometres in length; we are drilling bore-holes for clean, safe water, giving millions of people access to safe drinking water every year."
"We are investing in people in primary education in a large number of countries."
"We are making a contribution to the debt initiative second to none, even comparing ourselves with the biggest countries in the world."
"We would welcome a little more competition as far as that is concerned."
"I warn against giving the impression our development cooperation activities have all but stopped."
"That is not the case."
"We have to be realistic, clear and demanding in order to enter the primary league amongst donors and not to remain where we are right now."
"This is the goal."
"Mr Deva, we will, as part of the new Suva Agreement - the successor to the Lomé Convention - be including in our activities a EUR 2.2 billion private investment facility which will be administered by the European Investment Bank at arm's length."
"It will deal with private partners, inspiring and helping the creation of business activities between European companies and business in the developing ACP countries."
"This major innovation is being prepared right now on the same basis as you were talking about."
"Micro-credit is a big thing but it is not the only answer to all problems."
"However, we are quite active in this field also."
"I thank Parliament for what I sense to be a more than positive reception because the critical notes that I have heard are of a kind that I would tend to interpret as enthusiastic support."
"We should be careful not to end up facing a situation where there is a real threat of having to set our sights lower."
"Thank you very much, Mr Nielson, for your optimistic view of the future."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0220/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission."
"First part"
"Question No 32 by (H-0433/00):"
"Subject: Jailing of opposition politician Xu Wenli in China Is the Commission aware of the recent trial involving Xu Wenli in China and the severe prison sentence that was imposed."
"What action did the Commission take?"
"The Commission is aware of the recent trial referred to by the honourable Member in his question and of the sentence imposed on Mr Liu, who assisted Xu Wenli in setting up a branch of the banned China Democracy Party."
"Xu Wenli, one of the founders of the CDP, was sentenced to 13 years in jail in December 1998, along with two other prominent democracy campaigners."
"As the honourable Member will know, the longstanding policy of the Union is to raise the individual cases of Chinese citizens who have been in prison for political offences with the Chinese authorities, particularly in the context of the human rights dialogue, the last meeting of which took place on 25 February this year."
"The Union has therefore raised with the Chinese Government the cases of Xu Wenli and others who have been trying to exercise basic rights that are specified by the United Nation's Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was actually signed by China in October 1998."
"To date, the Commission knows that at least 23 CDP members have been jailed for subversion as a result of their efforts to exercise those rights to which China is committed."
"In relation to these and other cases, the Commission consistently calls upon the People's Republic of China to comply with the letter and spirit of the United Nation's human rights conventions which it has signed; to do so even before China's ratification of those conventions and actively to pursue ratification."
"These efforts by the Commission will continue."
"I thank you, Commissioner, for your answer and I should like to ask whether the Commission is aware that 14 months into his 13-year prison sentence Mr Xu is suffering from hepatitis and there are serious doubts as to the effectiveness of the medical treatment he is receiving."
"I would seek an assurance that the Commission will enquire into this and ask the Chinese authorities whether they are providing the appropriate medical treatment."
"Bearing in mind, Commissioner, what you said about your willingness to raise individual cases, could I also ask you to make enquiries about the fate of Rebiya Kadeer."
"She was arrested on 11 August 1999 in Urumqui, the capital of the XUAR, while on her way to meet representatives of the US Congressional Research Service."
"She was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years' imprisonment at a secret trial."
"I will gladly provide more detailed information on that, Mr Commissioner."
"It makes me even more angry that European Union Member States, faced with these cases and the 23 in general you referred to, show such spinelessness in refusing to support the US initiative in Geneva at the UN Commission on Human Rights attacking China's human rights record."
"I should like to tell the honourable Member that in respect to Mr Xu, I will convey what he said about the apparently grave condition of that political prisoner to my colleagues in the external relations area."
"I am certain that they will follow previous practice in making enquiries of the Chinese authorities as to the quality and consistency of the treatment of Mr Xu for hepatitis."
"I know that my colleagues will be happy to respond to the honourable Member in order to keep him informed with any information they are able to obtain."
"So far as Miss Kadeer is concerned, obviously I did not have notice of that question and am not in a position to respond."
"The question will, however, have been recorded."
"I will bring it to the attention of my colleagues and they will provide the honourable Member with the response he is seeking."
"Obviously, it would be a matter of great concern if someone, whose only offence is to be antagonistic towards an existing regime, were to be the victim of insufferable treatment."
"I know that my colleagues elsewhere in the Commission share this view, which I share with the honourable Member."
"As the author is not present, Question No 33 lapses."
"Question No 34 by (H-0357/00):"
"Subject: The Commission's reform programme and enlargement On 1 March 2000, the Commission adopted the White Paper on the reform of the Commission."
"The measures and actions announced in the White Paper provide for a radical reform of the Commission which will involve a considerable amount of time."
"Can the Commission indicate to what extent the present reform proposals take account of the forthcoming enlargement?"
"Do they anticipate the consequences which enlargement will have on the internal structure of the Commission and do the proposed measures and actions take account of such consequences?"
"If so, in what way?"
"If not, would it not have been more logical for the Commission to take account of enlargement in respect of certain aspects, thereby avoiding a situation whereby shortly after completion of the current reform process the Commission has to enter into a fresh round of reforms to cope with the impact of enlargement?"
"Does the Commission intend to present an action plan with a timetable, as is the case with the present reform plan, in order to prepare the structure of the Commission for the forthcoming enlargement?"
"The Commission's reform strategy White Paper fulfils the undertakings readily given to Parliament and to the Council last year to give immediate attention to addressing the way in which the Institution, as an organisation, currently undertakes its duties."
"Delay in designing a practical strategy and in pursuing necessary modernisation would not have been acceptable to the Commission, to the Council, to this Parliament or to the public, as I am sure the honourable Member understands."
"One of the specifically stated purposes of comprehensive reform is the development of strengthened administrative performance which will, amongst other things, enable the Commission to deal more effectively with changes in the current and the future Union and in the wider world."
"Clearly the challenges posed by the forthcoming extensive enlargement are different in nature and scale than those presented by any previous enlargement."
"The Commission must therefore be capable of achieving the highest standards of executive and administrative performance in the discharge of its powers and duties in order to facilitate that massive and welcome development."
"As the College of Commissioners made clear in our introduction to the White Paper, and elsewhere in that document, and I quote what we said: ""the challenges of globalisation and future enlargement require better governance at all levels including the European Union""."
"All political institutions must rise to this challenge and so must the Commission."
"Reform is therefore an essential precondition - a precondition for realising our vision of Europe."
"The current administrative reform is not a limited exercise - it is an evolutionary process as we have made very clear - it will be continuously monitored and the results achieved will be assessed in order to provide for any relevant adjustments."
"Proper account will be taken of any specific requirements that arise from the enlargement process, and naturally that will apply to human resources implications of the ongoing change."
"Issues such as the management of the increased cultural diversity within the Commission and an early retirement scheme that is directly linked to enlargement will, for instance, be amongst those that receive particular attention."
"As with past enlargements, specific measures concerning the appointment and integration of officials from the new Member States will be adopted at the appropriate time."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response."
"I would, however, like to add something."
"One of the main challenges in the enlargement process will be to tailor the veterinary and plant-health conditions prevalent in the acceding countries to those in the European Union."
"Would the Commissioner be prepared to encourage observers from the Central and Eastern European countries that wish to join the EU, to attend management committees, scientific committees or any other committees concerned with veterinary and plant health, on a permanent basis?"
"Mr President, the honourable Member's approach to these and many other matters is I know extremely constructive."
"What I know on the basis of precedent, and also the Commission's assessment of the scope and the depth of the challenges that arise from the forthcoming enlargement, is that appropriate measures will be taken at the right time not only in terms of the recruitment and integration of properly skilled staff from the new Member States but also to assist with the preparation of other areas of expertise - presumably including the Scientific and other committees."
"To some extent, of course, the process will be assisted by the fact that the international science community inside and outside the European Union is genuinely international."
"In addition to relying upon those casual professional relationships, I am sure that the Commission will want to ensure that there is continuity and access provided for those new incoming Member States not only in areas like those that he has mentioned - veterinary and plant health - but in many other areas where the smoothest possible integration of efforts is a matter of crucial and mutual importance."
"Question No 35 by (H-0411/00):"
"Subject: Boarding of Community vessels by Canadian inspectors in international waters Five years after the seizure of the Estai, the Community fleet fishing in NAFO international waters has expressed deep concern at the boarding of a Portuguese vessel, the Santa Mafalda, supposedly by Canadian inspectors."
"The Santa Mafalda, a vessel used to catch halibut, was boarded on 24 April last. The inspectors confiscated all documentation and refused to leave the vessel."
"Furthermore, a launch belonging to the Canadian authorities has been tracking the vessel constantly, thus hampering its fishing activity."
"A few days earlier, Canadian inspectors had apparently boarded a Spanish freezer trawler, which was also fishing in international waters."
"European fishermen fear that the underlying aim of these boarding incidents is to deter them from using the fishing grounds in which they catch halibut and cod."
"What information does the Commission possess on these incidents?"
"Can it clarify whether the inspectors were acting on behalf of NAFO or the Canadian Government?"
"Has it taken any action in this regard, or does it intend to do so?"
"Should accepting Community monitoring rules for inspections in NAFO waters prove problematic for Canada, what initiatives could the Commission take to set clear and binding rules which would allay the doubts of those working in the sector and the Canadian Government alike?"
"Thank you Mr President."
"As the honourable Member who raised the question will know, in accordance with the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation scheme of joint international inspection and surveillance, each contracting party may assign means of inspection and inspectors to the NAFO scheme and NAFO inspectors may inspect any fishing vessel flying the flag of a contracting party."
"NAFO inspectors are obliged to carry out their duties in accordance with rules set out in the NAFO scheme and they are also obliged to remain under the operational control of the authorities of their contracting parties and be responsible to them."
"Against that background, on 23 April two Canadian NAFO inspectors accompanied by a trainee carried out an inspection of the Community fishing vessel Santa Mafalda which was operating at that time in the NAFO regulatory area."
"The Canadian inspectors in question and the surveillance vessel from which the inspection was carried out are assigned to the NAFO scheme."
"Their inspection was carried out under its auspices."
"Having been informed by the Canadians, inspectors of the Commission boarded the Santa Mafalda to verify the grounds on which the Canadian inspectors based their citation of a serious infringement."
"In conducting this verification the Commission inspectors ensured the security and continuity of the evidence on board and transmitted their report to the Portuguese authorities."
"Those authorities in turn ordered the Santa Mafalda to the port of Aveiro in Portugal for a thorough inspection."
"The Santa Mafalda arrived in Aveiro on 10 May 2000 and two Commission inspectors participated in a thorough inspection of the vessel."
"The Commission has drawn the attention of the Canadian authorities to the procedures followed by the Canadian inspectors in relation to their seizure of documentation and their continued stay on board the Santa Mafalda."
"The Commission takes the view that the Canadian NAFO inspectors in question acted in breach of the NAFO scheme by taking away documents from the vessel without the permission of the master and by continuing to stay on board the vessel."
"However, it is relevant to note that in this case the master of the vessel and the Portuguese authorities did not oppose the prolonged stay of the Canadian inspectors on the vessel and the fishing activities of the Santa Mafalda were not obstructed."
"Mr Commissioner, I am satisfied with your reply, but I would like to add something else. The sea is a difficult world, and the Community fleet which fishes in international Atlantic waters experiences the interference of controllers and patrols from coastal countries which give the impression that, behind the harassment they sometimes suffer, there is one sole intention; to expel them from those fishing grounds."
"The Commissioner knows, as I do, that the current situation in the NAFO is not, fortunately, what it was five years ago after the seizure of the Estai."
"The European Commission - like the fishing sector itself - has made significant efforts to iron out our differences."
"However, there are still outstanding questions, such as the extraterritorial clauses, which allow the Canadian Government to carry out inspections, controls and seizures beyond their national waters, in open sea, which is incompatible with international provisions and which, all too frequently, involves the arbitrary application of controls within the framework of the NAFO."
"For all these reasons, I would like to ask the Commissioner how the European Commission intends to defend the right of the Community fleet to fish freely in these waters, albeit within the existing rules."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the honourable lady."
"The only way in which we can actually ensure the proper maintenance of an international convention which has the effect of law is to demand on all occasions that the procedures required under the law are fulfilled properly in a balanced but a completely full way."
"That is the position being taken by the Commission which is why I drew attention to the fact that the Commissioners have already reached the conclusion that the Canadian inspectors actually acted in breach of the scheme by taking documents without the sight of the master and by virtue, maybe, of their very prolonged stay on board that vessel."
"The Portuguese authorities, as the honourable lady will know because of her interest, are now undertaking a full investigation and it would therefore not be proper for the Commission to communicate opinions beyond those I have already offered, but she can be absolutely certain that the Commission and its inspectors together with the Member States are vigilant in sustaining the proper rights of all vessels on the high seas."
"Mr President, I had asked the question as a result of Mr Kinnock' s first reply, before Mrs Miguélez asked her question."
"I had understood from Mr Kinnock that the ship was in fact being inspected in a Portuguese port and that this inspection had taken place in the presence of Community inspectors."
"I understand, from his second reply, that he does not yet have the result of that inspection."
"That is what I wanted him to clarify."
"If he does have it, I would like him to say so, but I understand from his second reply that he does not."
"If that is the case I believe it would be prudent and logical for us to await the final result."
"I would ask Mr Kinnock to communicate to Mr Fischler that, as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to know the result of that inspection as soon as possible."
"I would like to receive it because this Parliament will have to act accordingly."
"In any event, I would like to condemn, in support of Mrs Miguélez, the abuse of authority on the part of the Canadian NAFO inspectors which Mr Kinnock mentioned."
"I would therefore like to make that request and condemn this violation of NAFO regulations."
"Mr President, I will draw the honourable Member's remarks to the attention of my colleague, Mr Fischler, and I know that they will be of interest to him."
"He summarises the position precisely because the inspection has taken place and the Portuguese authorities are reaching their conclusions."
"It would not be proper publicly to pursue the matter further, but when the report of that inspection and the assessment by the Portuguese authorities are available, I am certain that they will be communicated to interested Members including, of course, the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Fisheries and I am certain the honourable lady whose interest is manifest."
"Question No 36 by (H-0415/00):"
"Subject: Need to support and strengthen the olive oil sector The implementation of the new olive oil regulation is having severe consequences for Greek producers who are poor farmers in infertile and island regions."
"The abolition of the intervention price which had already been eroded has brought producer prices down to derisory levels: together with the co-responsibility levy this has had the effect of decimating olive oil producers' incomes."
"The profiteering of traders who sell olive oil to the consumer at prices many times the producers' price have increased, and the small quota accorded to Greece in practice cancels out the entitlement to plant a further 3 000 hectares provided for in the new regulation."
"Since olive oil is a basic product and the main source of income for farmers from the most disadvantaged regions in Greece and is also a staple of the Mediterranean diet, will the Commission say what measures it intends to take to protect olive oil cultivation and producers' incomes so as to enable them to stay on the land and when it intends to act?"
"Does it intend to increase the quota in order to cover existing production and the volume of production expected to result from the new plantations?"
"Will it reintroduce the institution of intervention, but improved as far as prices and the date of commencement are concerned?"
"Finally, will it draw up and implement an integrated and effective policy to promote and advertise olive oil both in the EU countries and in third countries, so that olive oil can occupy the place to which it is entitled - according to scientific findings - in the human diet?"
"Second part"
"Questions to Mr Solbes"
"One of the greatest benefits of the question time arrangement is the way in which it endows me with instant expertise on issues as far apart as fishing, olive oil and human rights in China!"
"I am happy to respond to Mr Korakas."
"In June 1998, the Commission undertook to present a proposal on the future of the common organisation of the market in olive oil to the Council and Parliament in 2000."
"The new regime would apply from the 2001/2002 marketing year which, as the honourable Member will know, begins on 1 November 2001."
"The Commission is currently studying new data on the structure of olive oil production in the various producer Member States, as well as developments in the world market where the Community is the leading producer by a considerable margin."
"The study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product."
"As far as product promotion is concerned, the Community is already financing promotion campaigns through the International Olive Oil Council."
"Those campaigns appear to have a positive effect within the European Union and indeed in third countries."
"In response to a specific issue raised by the honourable Member's question, I have to point out that the produce of new plantings would not give entitlement to aid."
"However, the Commission hopes that the Community producers concerned will benefit fully under derogations from the rules as they relate to approved planting programmes, although the olive oil in question would count towards the maximum guaranteed quantity which has already been set."
"Finally, the Commission wishes to point out that rather than simply abolishing the intervention system, what has actually happened is that it has been replaced by a system of private storage which is more flexible than the intervention system because it applies throughout the marketing year if the market situation calls for such support."
"Since the start of the 1998/99 marketing year, it has not been necessary to pay private storage aid."
"However, it is worth emphasising that over that same period the old buying-in intervention system would not have been activated either."
"Mr President, we do indeed appear to be having problems understanding each other in this Chamber."
"Because of the policies of the European Union, olive oil producers are truly at the mercy of big producers who negotiate among themselves and try to buy olive oil at unbelievably low prices."
"This situation has reached dramatic proportions with the abolition of the albeit downgraded intervention system and the system of private storage, let me assure you is, quite frankly, a joke."
"So how are we to deal with this situation?"
"Will an improved intervention system providing rudimentary protection for producers be reintroduced?"
"And given that, on a global scale, olive oil is so important to the human body and plays such an important role in maintaining farming populations in disadvantaged areas, why is it that the quotas, particularly for Greece, are so low?"
"Are you going to increase them?"
"And with the widespread practice of mixing olive oil with sunflower seed oil, what does the Commission intend to do to put a stop to this practice, which is harming producers and consumers to the benefit of industrial racketeers?"
"In this spirit, does the Commission believe that this phenomenon can be tackled through guile, i.e., by increasing the quota for Italy, which is the main country responsible for mixing oil, and reducing the quota for Greece?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member and I know of the deep concerns he voices."
"They certainly are communicated in this House and he does it in a most articulate fashion."
"All I can say to him at this juncture, because I know this is a matter of continuing concern and activity by him, is that the CMO for olive oil is due to be reformed, as I indicated earlier, by 1 November 2001, following agreement in the Council and in this Parliament in adopting Regulation 1638/98."
"I cannot assume that if the situation were precisely as the honourable Member describes, and smaller producers were in a dangerously disadvantaged position by comparison with the big producers, there would have been such agreement in the Council and in this House."
"Therefore, I hope he will give attention to the results of the studies I mentioned being undertaken at the moment by the Commission, both in terms of the general questions he raised when he submitted his question and also in terms of the relative fortunes of big producers and small producers."
"Finally, as someone who is merely a consumer of olive oil, I hope there is no extensive dilution of what is one of my favourite complementary foodstuffs and that, whatever else we do in the European Community, we strive together with olive oil producers of all sizes to maintain the maximum quality."
"That is how we sustain our considerable lead in world markets."
"Thank you very much, Mr Kinnock, for your cooperation during this Question Time."
"We also congratulate you for using olive oil, which is very good for the health."
"I also say this from a Mediterranean standpoint."
"Question No 37 by (H-0409/00):"
"Subject: Further integration entailed by EMU In the Commission's estimation, to what extent do the requirements imposed by EMU on economic policy - which include permanently fixed exchange rates - create the need for further economic integration in the form of a more extensive common budget (a common fiscal policy), cyclical transfers between Member States, increased labour mobility between the participating states and/or a more flexible labour market?"
"The introduction of the euro will increase economic integration and reinforce the positive effects of the single market, primarily by eliminating the risks relating to exchange rates."
"There are also other factors. There is greater transparency in prices, an improvement in competition and an increase in trade and investment both cross-border and also between other countries or areas affected by monetary union."
"At the same time, as the common monetary policy will mean the same interest rate for all Member States of the monetary union, it will not only have an effect in terms of developing demand, but it will also mean greater integration of the financial markets."
"This should also bring benefits for savers and investors."
"For this to have the greatest positive effect, it is essential that we carry out a policy of rationalised public finances, which will not generate tensions in monetary policy itself, and at the same time, a decisive policy of structural reforms and a competition policy, which will allow the maximum benefit to be drawn from the process."
"In order for economic and monetary union to function successfully, we do not need a major budget which will allow cyclical transfers in the event of difficulties."
"I believe that the Treaty, supplemented by the Stability and Growth Pact, provides adequate instruments to implement an economic policy which is compatible with a unified monetary policy."
"The basic framework which we have introduced is a framework of mutual supervision of national fiscal policies and of coordination of economic policies by means of processes to improve our structural situations and the coordination or creation of a positive macroeconomic environment which will favour growth and employment, and at the same time reduce the possibility of asymmetric clashes caused by economic policies."
"Budgetary consolidation itself, which is, of course, the reduction of the public deficit, gives each Member State room to act in adverse situations."
"Greater labour mobility may certainly help to confront the problems which may arise in the event of asymmetric clashes."
"Both an increase in the available work force and an improvement in productivity would improve the situation in terms of creating jobs and helping to reduce unemployment."
"That is why we attach particular importance to labour mobility."
"The Commission has therefore insisted on its various strategies regarding the specific point of labour mobility, while remaining aware that this is a difficult issue."
"It is difficult within Member States and it is difficult between one Member State and another, due not only to historical and cultural incompatibilities in terms of education, but also to a series of other aspects related to this type of situation."
"Finally, I would say that clearly these difficulties which are being considered - and which may arise in the future - will surely be much less serious than those which have been brought up in theory by people who study monetary union, given that - and this is our experience to date - we are seeing an approximation of the economic policies of the countries and we have created room, in monetary terms, for us to confront difficulties more easily than in the past."
"Thank you very much for your answer which, up to a point, contains many of the features I had expected."
"I should like to follow up your answer and ask you what is meant by saying that the euro project will not be a success unless there is a large budget which can cope with fluctuations in the trade cycle."
"What kind of large budget?"
"Is it a large EU budget which is being considered?"
"I should also like to hear whether it can be imagined continuing with a policy based upon recommendations and exhortations to the euro zone countries."
"For example, Denmark has, in fact, on a number of occasions disregarded recommendations from the Commission."
"Is this state of affairs to be accepted in the long term or will the Stability and Growth Pact be followed up and a stable environment ensured for EMU by adopting working methods of a type different from those involving recommendations and exhortations?"
"In your reply - or comment - I note two implicit questions."
"Firstly, a major budget is essential to tackle the cyclical difficulties."
"This would lead us into a very complex debate. The problems are not caused by clashes themselves, but by asymmetric clashes; asymmetric clashes differ depending on whether they are temporary or permanent, whether they relate to supply or demand."
"We have little experience to help us define a typology and lay down a single formula for resolving these difficulties by budgetary means."
"We believe that it is a much better idea to establish a general framework of economic health, of good economic behaviour, which will allow us to confront the difficulties in the case in question."
"In the future we will continue with recommendations to comply with the stability and growth pact."
"I do not know whether it is a good or a bad thing, but that is our obligation as the Commission."
"This is an agreement adopted by the Council of Ministers as a result of initiatives by certain Member States and which I also support, since I believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties."
"Earlier I referred to the fact that the situation is different in each of the Member States."
"In this year' s recommendations we have taken particular account of the Commission' s own analyses regarding what the margins are, and which benchmarks we are setting in each of the Member States to tackle the crisis without exceeding the 3% public deficit, which is the figure we have established as a reference."
"We can see that that situation is different in each of the countries and, therefore, our recommendations and our comments will always be different in each of the countries, although this is not the only aspect that we take into consideration."
"Mr President, the current weakness and volatility of the euro is a cause of concern both within and outside the euro-zone."
"Does the Commissioner feel that the current stability pact and the powers of the European Central Bank are sufficient to force the Euro-land states to make the difficult and fundamental adjustments in their economic and labour markets, which are essential if the euro is going to be taken seriously by the global financial markets?"
"I do not see any great correlation between the two questions, but I do note that the euro is being taken seriously."
"What has happened with the euro?"
"There are many technical explanations as to why we are in this situation."
"This would require a broader debate, focussing on the starting point, which is the development of economic forecasts and the real economies of each of the areas. It would also clearly concern changes in interest rates and certain other technical elements, such as expiry dates for certain types of issues etc."
"The reality is that, by analysing the euro on the basis, fundamentally, of the evolution of the exchange rate, we are making an incorrect evaluation of its introduction."
"The euro has been a great success, in terms of its introduction, in terms of issuing it as a currency, in terms of the consolidation of an excellent economic situation in Europe and in terms of the forecasts for the future."
"It is true that the interest rate is not what we would have liked."
"We believe that a strong economy means a strong euro."
"We also believe that the development of growth in Europe will be strong throughout 2000 and, as a result, we will match US growth by the end of this year."
"In these circumstances, we believe that the value of the euro will be rising in the coming months."
"Therefore, despite a certain degree of concern - because that concern exists within public opinion - about the evolution of the euro, we believe that this situation will be corrected and that it should be considered to be temporary rather than permanent."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the supplementary question by Mr Purvis was most pertinent, since recently the need for increased economic cooperation amongst the EMU countries has been justified by precisely this weakening of the value of the euro in relation to the US dollar."
"The reason for the dollar becoming stronger in comparison to the euro is simply that the national economy of the USA is stronger than that of the euro countries."
"Hundreds of thousands of new jobs have recently been created in the USA, while the number of jobs in Europe has been cut."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner firstly, whether the Commission admits that the weakening of the euro that has been much thrashed out in public, is a consequence of the infrastructural problems and lack of dynamism of the EU economy, particularly in relation to the USA, and whether he really believes that the kind of Keynesian action as proposed by Mrs Frahm would be the cure for this weakening of the euro, and whether he believes that the Commission will achieve better results in this matter, when the national governments of France and Germany have actually proceeded in the totally opposite direction, and their actions have weakened even further the competitiveness of the euro area."
"As an example, I refer here to the decisions made by the French Government on working hours."
"I will try to reply briefly, although these are complex questions and I will therefore have to give this point some attention."
"Firstly, with regard to increasing cooperation in terms of coordinating economic policies, I believe that it is necessary and positive and is one of the elements which is emerging from this current crisis."
"The French President has highlighted this and it will obviously be a point for debate during the next presidency."
"I do not agree with the theory that the euro' s development is leading to a fall in employment in Europe and an increase in employment in the USA."
"Transfers of capital may generate additional activity in the United States, but the positive increase in exports is generating activity in Europe."
"It would require a very complex and profound debate to deal with this issue."
"In any event, what I do believe - as I said earlier - is that the euro, at the moment, has an exchange rate which, if we analyse it in relation to its components and its historical situation, is not that different from situations which have existed at other times."
"I am convinced that this is a transitional situation which will improve during this year."
"Question No 38 by (H-0419/00):"
"Subject: Precarious employment and the industrial-accident rate in Spain and in the Murcia region At the Lisbon Summit, a commitment was made to achieving full employment in proper jobs throughout the EU."
"In response to the French Government' s proposal involving a reduction in working hours in order to create more proper, stable jobs, the approach agreed between the Spanish and UK Governments, which calls for further deregulation of employment conditions in order to increase the number of jobs, has been adopted."
"Spain' s experience over the last four years has demonstrated that jobs are indeed created but are predominantly casual and precarious in nature, and they are associated with a high rate of industrial accidents, the Murcia region being the part of Spain where that rate is highest."
"Does the Commission not think that there is an urgent case for monitoring the conditions under which jobs are being created in the various EU countries and regions, so as to ensure that job-creation is not at the expense of the stability and dignity of workers and especially of young people entering the job market for the first time?"
"Questions to Mr Verheugen"
"Mr President, despite the fact that I was born next to the Murcia region, it is difficult for me to analyse, in Community terms, the problems of the precarious employment there."
"Therefore, allow me to make a rather more general comment."
"The assessment of the labour market reforms which have resulted from the processes we have established in the Union - the Luxembourg process and the broad guidelines for economic policy - demonstrates that the reforms of the regulations on the labour market in the different countries are making a positive and significant contribution to greater economic growth and to promoting the creation of employment and the greater participation of men and women in the labour market."
"The broad guidelines of economic policy and the recommendations for employment have never advocated a simple deregulation of the labour market, as the question states."
"Together with the reform of certain labour market regulations, they also include, for example, the need to adopt measures which will promote entrepreneurial spirit or active labour market policies - and we state this quite deliberately - to improve employment opportunities."
"The measures adopted in each Member State must be adapted to the problems and reality of each of them."
"It is also quite normal for the Commission to insist on the need to hold debates and make agreements with social partners so that they may actively participate in the changes to the labour market in each country."
"As well as a significant and lasting increase in the levels of employment, one of the key priorities of the employment strategy is to improve the quality of jobs."
"The recent Lisbon Summit gave a new impulse to the Union' s economic and social agenda and we have also insisted on this point by talking of more and better employment."
"I would also like to highlight, as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now, the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work, which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the Commission, which advocates better jobs in Europe."
"Labour market reforms directed at improving employment opportunities and workers' ability to adapt to these new opportunities in no way seek to undermine working conditions or health and safety at work."
"In accordance with its legal competence as laid down in the Treaty, the Commission has kept up the necessary efforts to implement and propose various legal instruments and monitor the incorporation of the acquis communautaire in this area."
"With regard to your specific question and the case of Spain, it is Spain' s responsibility, like the other Members, to apply the Commission' s directives."
"It is also the responsibility of the Member States to monitor the application of these directives in all of their regions."
"The Commission must guarantee that those directives are transposed into national law correctly and, clearly, to monitor all the issues relating to its application, which is the responsibility of the national authorities."
"I am grateful to Mr Solbes for the intention behind his reply, which is to safeguard and show concern for worker' s conditions."
"Nevertheless, the political analysis of the Lisbon Summit reveals that there were two proposals: one which was more social, more committed, which came from the French Prime Minister, Mr Jospin, and the other, resulting from a previous agreement between Mr Blair and Mr Aznar, deregulating the labour market and making it more flexible."
"If we take Spain as an example, it is clear that job instability, temporary employment and work accidents are on the increase."
"Do you not therefore believe that it would be appropriate, in the review of the Treaty of Amsterdam, to incorporate the Social Charter with specific instruments and measures, as occurred with the five classic points of the Treaty of Maastricht, in order to guarantee full employment and employment quality and that it therefore not be left to the whim of each of the countries?"
"By way of clarification, reference has been made to the number of work accidents in Murcia because it has such a sad record within Spain; that is why we are concerned."
"I imagined that was the reason for the reference to Murcia, and not the fact that I was born next to that province."
"With regard to the basic problem, I would make a different comment."
"Our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment."
"In the broad guidelines for economic policy for this year, and in the specific recommendation for Spain, we expressly refer to the need for the problems to be analysed, amongst them the cost of dismissal, which may be important with regard to temporary employment, because we believe that a distinction should be made between precariousness and flexibility, which are two very different things."
"Nevertheless, you introduced a second element in your supplementary question which, in my opinion, is of great interest: Why do we not establish the objective of full employment in the same way that we established the objectives of the Treaty of Maastricht at the time?"
"Basically because they are two completely different types of figure."
"At Maastricht, what we put in place was compliance with obligations dependent on voluntary decisions adopted by the Member States which form the European Union."
"In the case of full employment, the figure is the consequence of measures which are intended to achieve an objective, but which do not have a causal relationship which guarantees its objective."
"What we can consider is what is being done in the various employment programmes, and that is the implementation of certain elements which will allow us to move towards full employment."
"When we spoke of full employment in the Commission document which served as a basis for the debate in Lisbon, we expressly said that if we add the development of the economy in accordance with currently available figures to the various determining factors and policies proposed by the Commission, full employment will be achieved."
"However, this cannot be a political objective, as in Maastricht, because it does not depend on the will of the different governments or on a specific decision by each one of them."
"I would like to say that, in order to judge from afar, it is often necessary to understand the reality."
"In the countries of the Southern Mediterranean, and specifically in the region of Murcia, they have, in recent years, stopped managing unemployment and started to manage employment."
"They have moved from an extraordinary and terrifying level of unemployment, originating in the great state industries whose economic model was unsustainable, through a crisis and then to a situation involving the growth of small businesses (SMBs) and economic incentives which have generated a new and vibrant model."
"However, it is clear that accidents in the workplace - which I am now talking about - are a problem of education and mutual responsibility on the part of businessmen, the state, public administration and, of course, trade unions."
"Unless they all work in unison, they will not achieve this objective."
"In Spain, back in 1995, a law was adopted in this respect, and they are trying to comply with it, but this cannot be achieved in a day."
"Therefore, Commissioner, firstly, what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area, so that a sense of responsibility may be developed?"
"Secondly and very specifically: is there any programme to educate immigrants in the language of their host country, so that we can educate them to understand the minimum safety standards in this region which is host to many immigrants who do not speak our language?"
"Thank you for your comments."
"With regard to your questions, I will say again that the distribution of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States dictates that these matters fall to the Member States."
"Consequently, both the funding of these immigrant education programmes and the active policies are decisions which logically depend on which social policy the Spanish Government accepts or decides on."
"Question No 39 by (H-0352/00):"
"Subject: Adaptation of the applicant countries Will the Commission indicate the total number of documents that have been sent to the applicant countries as well as the total volume of the 'acquis' and will it consider forms of cooperation that do not require the applicant countries to accept every rule?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the entire Community acquis, i.e. all the legal acts of the European Union without exception were sent to the candidate countries immediately after the resolution of the Luxembourg European Council in December 1997, during the course of screening."
"No-one has ever counted them and I cannot therefore tell you how many there are."
"We usually talk of just over 20 000 legal acts in this context."
"Mr President, there is not very much to thank the Commission for."
"I find it completely incomprehensible that there should be an institution which is unable to put together elementary statistics concerning the existing rules, which is unable to add up how much money is being sent to the candidate countries, which is unable to provide some general numerical information so that ordinary people can follow what is happening and which is unable to supply the total acquis on a CD-Rom to anyone who might be interested in it."
"It is really quite simple. I have worked on it for a good many years."
"It is completely impossible even for organisations with academic employees to find out how extensive the 'acquis' is, and it is apparently impossible for Mr Vanhengen to give the entire acquis to a Member of the European Parliament who is quite prepared to go through it and distribute the tasks among the different employees in order to see what positions are to be adopted on its various aspects."
"So there is nothing to thank the Commission for."
"Mr President, Mr Bonde, we have met each other face to face here before, and I personally am having to exercise a great deal of self-control in order to maintain the necessary degree of decorum in the House."
"The legal acts which we are talking about here are legal acts passed by the Council, by Parliament, by the Commission and by all the Community institutions."
"You, as a member of the most important legislative institution of the European Union know full well that these legal acts have not been numbered consecutively."
"I do not know of a single Member State of the European Union whose laws are numbered consecutively."
"Even the laws in your country - and I have taken the trouble of finding out - are not numbered consecutively."
"If you think that Commission officials are well employed if I sit them down and tell them to spend a week counting the legal acts issued since 1955, then let me tell you that I do not."
"I have no intention of arranging for them to be counted."
"The information which I have given you is as accurate as possible: i.e. that candidate countries are sent all, I repeat all the legal acts of the European Union without exception."
"I am curious to know how it helps if I tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425."
"If you want, you sit down and do it."
"You can find the entire Community acquis on-line on the Celex website here in Parliament."
"You tell your employees to count these legal acts, because I shall not tell mine to do so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the acquis is, of course, an important basis for accession."
"Can you tell us how acquis screening is proceeding in your view?"
"With which candidate countries has most progress been made?"
"Which chapters have been completed?"
"Chancellor Schröder recently stated in a press conference that the first admissions will probably be in 2002."
"How do you assess the scenario if the legal inventory is completed in optimum time?"
"What do you think is the earliest possible date for accession if optimum use is made of all deadlines and options?"
"I can tell the honourable Member that screening - i.e. legislative adjustment - was of course completed with all candidates some time ago."
"It is updated now and again because the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are not idle and continue to produce legal acts, meaning that the acquis changes."
"This amended acquis must, of course, be included in negotiations. But this happens on a regular basis."
"The screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates."
"Your question is based on a misunderstanding."
"Screening is not the same as negotiation, screening is merely an adjustment process."
"Screening is used merely to identify the acquis of the European Union and how much of it already forms part of the candidate country' s legislation and how much does not."
"That has been done."
"Now you want to know how far negotiations have proceeded overall."
"I know that for the Luxembourg group of countries, with which negotiations started in March 1998, between 10 and 15 out of a total of 31 negotiating chapters have been provisionally completed."
"A few more will be completed during the Portuguese presidency."
"But more important than the number of chapters completed is probably the number of chapters opened."
"By the end of the Portuguese presidency, all 29 chapters will be on the negotiating table for the Luxembourg group of countries."
"Only the chapters entitled ""Institutions"" and ""Miscellaneous"" are still closed for obvious reasons."
"They come at the end."
"With the Helsinki group of countries, negotiations did not start until February of this year."
"Between 5 and 8 chapters will be opened for these countries during the Portuguese presidency."
"Indeed, I think that we will be able to provisionally close a whole series of chapters by the end of the Portuguese presidency, but we cannot yet forecast how many with any degree of accuracy."
"In all events, the process is proceeding apace."
"It is quite impossible to forecast when the negotiating process will be completed and when the first accessions will take place."
"There have been intensive discussions on this over recent weeks and months."
"The Commission stated quite clearly in Helsinki that an accession scenario could not be developed until all the information needed was available."
"We need to clarify if the Union itself is ready for accession, i.e. if the institutional reforms have been completed, how far negotiations have progressed and, most importantly, and this will be the most difficult exercise at the end, if a candidate country is judged to be in a position to really apply and implement the acquis it has adopted."
"As things stand today, I am bound to say that we cannot forecast when such a scenario will be ready."
"I have said on many occasions that I would like it to be ready by the end of this year, at the Nice summit."
"But whether or not that will be possible will only become apparent in the autumn of this year once we have the up-to-date progress reports on preparations for accession for each individual candidate country."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my question does not concern the timetable; instead I would like to ask a question regarding a principle of enlargement."
"The process of enlargement is expected to be a truly demanding one, in which there is a danger that we either become frustrated by long waiting times or compromise over the criteria by granting overlong transition periods, which will naturally cause displeasure in the old Member States."
"An arrangement such as the EEA agreement may be regarded as a solution of the past, but I would nevertheless like to ask, whether the Commission could, even in principle, consider a possible solution along the lines of the EEA agreement - not as it stands but of that nature - to be used as some sort of ' hatchery' or incubator for the new Member States prior to actual membership, instead of the applicant countries having to wait for long periods of time before permanent membership becomes a reality. I would further like to ask, whether the Commission shares the view that this kind of arrangement, along the lines of the EEA agreement, could considerably reduce the costs of enlargement and promote the economic development of the applicant countries."
"I hope this question was not an improper one at this time."
"Madam, what you wish to engage in now is a hypothetical discussion."
"This discussion was held in the first half of the 1990s and it culminated in resolutions of which you are aware, which were discussed on several occasions in Parliament and which can no longer be made retroactive, namely the resolution of the European Councils of Copenhagen, Essen and Luxembourg to prepare the Central and Eastern European Countries and Cyprus and Malta for full membership."
"There is no point today in debating whether or not there might have been an alternative."
"In any case, it is my recollection that the candidates were not satisfied with anything less."
"They would not have accepted less and would have seen it as discrimination, meaning that, in Luxembourg in 1997, there was no longer any realistic alternative to the resolution taken in any case."
"There is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership."
"If there were, I would know about it."
"But there is not."
"All 12 countries with which we are negotiating are seriously working towards the goal of full membership and I urgently advise you against opening a debate on changing the fundamental objectives of enlargement now that the process has begun."
"The candidates will only see it as a serious breach of trust."
"Question No 40 by (H-0388/00):"
"Subject: Eastward enlargement: transitional arrangements regarding the free movement of services Negotiations with the first group of applicant states (the 'Luxembourg group' ) on the free movement of services have reached a provisional conclusion."
"What transitional arrangements have been agreed to date?"
"What effects does the Commission expect these to have on small businesses and self-employed craft workers, particularly in the regions bordering on the applicant states?"
"Questions to Mr Monti"
"Mrs Müller, the question is based on an erroneous premise."
"The chapter entitled ""Free movement of services"" has not been provisionally completed with any candidate country."
"Nor do I expect this chapter to be completed with any country in the immediate future."
"Mr President, it is certainly correct to say, Mr Verheugen, that the chapter has not been completed, but negotiations have started."
"However what I am interested in is this: Have transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services been applied for during these negotiations?"
"You know, I am from a border region and I know exactly what the situation is on the ground."
"I am convinced that medium-sized companies and the craft industry will face huge problems and enormous challenges when it comes to the free movement of services, because there is a huge wage differential of 1:10 at present."
"You yourself know full well which industries are affected."
"Is there any intention on the European side to apply for transitional arrangements in the area of the free movement of services?"
"The Czech Republic has already applied for transition periods for the acquisition of land by foreigners and this will have an impact on services."
"What is your position on the transition periods which the Czech Republic has applied for and what is the Commission' s position in general on this point?"
"Mr President, Mrs Müller, I assume that you know that accession negotiations take the form of a state conference at which the Member States, not the Commission, negotiate and I am not therefore entitled to divulge the content of negotiations which have not yet been completed."
"I would gladly do so, but I am not allowed to."
"However, I can still answer the question, because the Commission naturally has an opinion on the points which you raised."
"First, the Commission takes the view that transition periods should only be considered during the enlargement process if the aim of enlargement cannot otherwise be achieved within the required time or by the required date."
"Transition periods must be very, very limited in both scope and duration, especially where the internal market is at stake."
"You must know that every transition period, irrespective of whom it benefits, suspends the internal market for that area."
"And if a large number of transition periods are agreed, then we can forget the whole idea of the internal market for years to come."
"That cannot be the meaning of enlargement."
"The question which you actually want answered is the question of how we can prepare for the problems which will arise in certain border regions following enlargement."
"The region which you come from and the region which I come from are just such regions."
"I have discussed this matter on many occasions in your country, as you know, and so I can be brief."
"I think that there may well be transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, which is the really difficult question."
"But we have not yet reached that point."
"In the area of the free movement of services, which will lead to stiffer competition in border regions, I think that we need to start preparing an action programme right now, particularly so that small and medium-sized enterprises in border regions will be capable of adapting to and withstanding this new competition."
"When, a few weeks ago, I once again read the Commission' s progress report on Lithuania, it occurred to me that the progress reports are being produced as if it were the previous enlargement we were talking about, that is to say the enlargement which took place before the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force."
"The Social Chapter is the corollary and counterpart of free movement of services and labour mobility."
"My question is about whether the forthcoming progress reports will, to a greater degree than the previous reports, take account of employment and of the Social Chapter, which is now a part of our 'acquis' ."
"I believe, in fact, that we can succeed in enlarging the Union if we combine these two aspects: firstly, the free movement of services and employees and, secondly, more equal conditions when it comes to the dialogue between employers and employees."
"The Social Chapter is, in fact, a part of our common regulations, with which the candidate States must also comply."
"I would like to remind MEPs in general that questions during Question Time must be specific questions on specific issues, which lead to specific answers."
"Everything else must take place during the normal debates of the parliamentary committees, because, otherwise, the MEPs who are due to follow will not be able to put their questions."
"Having given this general warning, I give the floor to the Commissioner."
"Mr President, to be honest, the underlying question was how many legal acts does the European Union have."
"Now I am being asked to answer a supplementary question which very specifically concerns one candidate country."
"I really cannot see the connection between these two questions, except that both relate to enlargement."
"However, if you take the view that there is a connection, then I am prepared to answer the question and am able to do so."
"All the acquis is taken into consideration in the progress reports on the candidate countries."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights cannot be taken into consideration because it is not yet ready."
"It is only now being drafted and its legal status has not yet been recognised."
"I know no better than you if this Charter will become part of the Treaty or if it will be no more than a solemn declaration."
"If this Charter should become part of the Treaty, it will of course be taken into account in future progress reports and we shall report on how the details of this Charter are being taken into account in the individual countries concerned."
"We must also report in the progress reports - as you will have noticed - as to whether a country is complying with the Copenhagen criteria."
"That basically answers the questions, because the political criteria of Copenhagen basically cover everything which will appear in this Charter of Fundamental Rights and these questions have also been answered in relation to Lithuania and will be answered in the next progress report on Lithuania."
"Mrs Thors is raising a point of order."
"I wish to point out that I was not earlier referring to Mrs Thors, but to all MEPs, but you have the floor."
"I would ask you not to enter into a debate with the Commissioner."
"Commissioner, I just want to clarify matters as there seems to be very bad interpretation - I was not talking about the Charter of Fundamental Rights but about the Social Charter including the rights of workers."
"These include working conditions which I think are a corollary to the movement of services."
"What are the conditions under which services are provided?"
"What are the conditions under which people are working?"
"That is the corollary of free movement."
"Mr President, I did indeed hear the words Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Of course, the Social Charter forms part of the Treaty and is therefore negotiated with all candidate countries."
"It forms part of the Community acquis."
"We report on how the individual candidate countries are preparing to apply the acquis, i.e. to apply the Social Charter."
"I am not at the moment in a position to tell you exactly how things stand with Lithuania in particular, but I would be more than happy to give you a written reply specifically on Lithuania and the Social Charter."
"Commissioner, we were in fact discussing the matter of transition periods."
"I should like to ask what your position is on the wishes of Poland and the Czech Republic to introduce long transition periods for two areas of concern to them, namely the free acquisition of land, including farmland, and the freedom of establishment."
"These are two very fundamental points and I should like to know what the Commission or your position is on this."
"I also wanted to ask you what you think about linking transition periods in the Member States and the candidate countries in the sort of package deal that is constantly being discussed."
"On the first question, I should like to say that the Member States still have no negotiating position on this question, nor is there any Commission draft on it."
"My own personal opinion is irrelevant."
"In any case, I cannot explain it to the European Parliament until the institutions have formed their own opinion."
"As far as linking transition periods is concerned, this happens automatically."
"We shall have a so-called ""play off"" at the end of the negotiations between the wishes which the Member States still have and the wishes which the candidates have."
"Basically their wishes concern transition periods."
"Irrespective of whether or not that is what it is formally called, you can imagine how this sort of negotiation process proceeds."
"It will be a negotiation and one of the principles of negotiation is that one side makes a concession so that the other side also makes a concession and an overall compromise must be found in the end which takes accounts of the wishes of both sides."
"Highly specific packages - if that was your question - whereby we also say: we are linking the wish for transition periods on the one side to the wish for transition periods on the other side are not feasible in my opinion."
"I should draw your attention to the fact that the question of transition periods in relation to the free movement of workers, for example, only gives cause for concern in two of the fifteen Member States."
"It is a German problem and it is an Austrian problem."
"It is not a problem for the other thirteen which is why I cannot predict exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations."
"Thank you very much, Mr Commissioner, for your replies."
"Questions Nos 41 and 42 will be replied to in writing."
"Mr Titley has the floor for a point of order."
"- Mr President, you realise this is the second month running you have done this to me - cut me off as my question was coming up."
"Yet you have allowed speakers to speak for over one minute including a rather long and pointless dialogue about the merits of Murcia."
"Also in the rules as I recall, you are only allowed to take one supplementary question per political group and these rules are being broken and as a consequence, for the second week running, I miss out on a question."
"I think it is absolutely outrageous and I will be writing to the President to complain."
"Mr Titley, I will reply briefly so as not to inconvenience the other MEPs."
"I am not getting at you."
"What has happened is that the 20 minutes devoted to Mr Verheugen have run out and it is now Mr Monti' s turn to reply, and he has been waiting some time."
"With regard to the Rules of Procedure, I must tell you that there are two supplementary questions, not one."
"Please read the Rules of Procedure."
"There are two questions."
"I am not going to get into a debate."
"You may write the letter you mentioned and you will receive a polite and full reply, but please do not worry since my intention was to give you the floor within the time allotted."
"Question No 43 by (H-0354/00):"
"Subject: Applications by Member States regarding state aids Is the Commission happy about the speed with which it deals with applications by Member States to provide state aids?"
"The time-limits for the Commission to take a decision on aid projects notified by a Member State are laid down in Council Regulation 659/1999."
"In most cases the Commission can close the examination of the notified aid project after the preliminary examination, that is without opening a formal investigation."
"Such decisions must be taken within two months following the receipt of a complete notification."
"In practice, notifications are frequently incomplete so that the Commission is forced to request additional information before it can take a decision."
"In order to further reduce this type of unnecessary delay, the Commission has prepared detailed standard notification forms for certain types of aid - regional, training, R&D, etc. and will continue to do so where appropriate."
"When doubts are raised about the compatibility of an aid project with the common market, the Commission must open a formal investigation for which the regulation provides an indicative time-limit of 18 months."
"The Commission would certainly prefer to be able to reduce this time-limit."
"However, this seems at present not feasible for different reasons."
"Firstly, considerable time is needed for translation and publication of the decision, for third parties to submit observations and for the Member States to comment on these observations."
"Secondly, the cases for which a formal investigation is opened are usually very complex and therefore require a longer period of examination, often also involving meetings with the Member State concerned and modifications to the original project."
"Nevertheless, the Commission considers that given the absence of any time-limit for the formal investigation procedure before the regulation, the regulation has already brought some progress."
"The Commission is also considering new ways of improving the efficiency and speed of state aid procedures."
"In this regard, the group exemption regulations, which are currently being prepared for aid to SMEs - training aid and de minimis aid - should be mentioned."
"Once they are in force, Member States will no longer need to notify aid projects complying with the conditions of the exemption regulations but can grant the aid immediately."
"This will considerably simplify state aid procedures."
"I wish to thank the Commissioner for that very full answer and, in particular, for the last part where he indicates that the Commission is looking at speeding up and, where possible, giving fast-track approval for state aids."
"However, in some Member States there is still a serious problem created by delays in decision-taking on state aids."
"I am convinced that some jobs have been lost because waiting for the decision on state aid has meant that a company has gone out of business in the end because it did not have the approval in time."
"In terms of the delay, is the Commission of the opinion that the reorganisation that is currently going on will provide new resources and assistance to him in his attempts to speed up the processing of state aids, or does the problem lie, as he partly indicated, with the Member States in the inadequate information provided by some of them when they make an application?"
"As you know, Mr Martin, we are working in a number of directions concerning state aid and in order to make state aid control more stringent."
"As to time limits, there are no plans to change the time limits in the near future."
"The deadlines are laid down in a Council regulation, which for the first time codifies state aid procedures, and since that regulation was only adopted in 1999 it is not likely to be modified in the near future."
"However, we are prepared and indeed willing to try to speed up certain aspects of the decision-making wherever possible, for example preparing the standard notification forms."
"You mentioned the problem of resources."
"Of course, this is a key problem for the whole of the competition policy activities and that includes state aid."
"The better the quality of information provided to begin with by Member States in their notifications, the more likely it is that the process will be smooth and conducted in a relatively short time scale."
"Question No 44 by (H-0355/00):"
"Subject: State aids to nuclear power Given that the electricity market came into effect in February last, subjecting all electricity production to the rules of the internal market, and that the nuclear common market under Article 92 of the Euratom Treaty does not include electricity as a product, does the Commission agree that electricity generated using nuclear energy is now subject to the same internal market rules as all other forms of electricity?"
"Does the Commission therefore consider that all state aids to the nuclear industry are prohibited by the EC Treaty, given that no derogation is specified, and that Article 98 of the Euratom Treaty does not provide for a subsidised accident insurance scheme for nuclear risks?"
"In this context what proposals, if any, has the Commission made to the UK Government concerning their NFFO system under Article 87 of the EC Treaty?"
"Can the Commission now confirm that it is investigating state aids to the nuclear industry as requested by the Green/EFA Group in its letter to Commissioner Monti of 10 March?"
"Mr President, the Commission shares the opinion of the honourable Member to the effect that the liberalisation of the electricity market affects all types of electricity, including electricity generated using nuclear energy."
"The Commission considers that there are no grounds for interpreting the EC or the Euratom Treaty as necessarily prohibiting all state aids to the nuclear industry."
"The Euratom Treaty does not include any clauses specifically prohibiting state aid."
"Moreover, while Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty do provide for a general principle prohibiting state aids, they also authorise specific categories of state aid."
"It would only be possible to determine the incompatibility of aid following specific investigation of each case."
"The Commission has not made any proposals to the UK Government on the subject of the NFFO system in application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty."
"As regards any existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking any systematic investigation."
"If, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to the attention of the Commission, such cases will be dealt with in compliance with the terms of the relevant articles of the EC and Euratom Treaties."
"Commissioner, thank you for your response, but I must admit I find it hard to grasp the logic of it."
"On the one hand, regarding state aid to the environment, you expect to implement a very thorough analysis of the subsidies to renewable energies even though it is clear that, for the time being, this sector is at a disadvantage due to the internalisation of costs."
"In other words, the market share of renewable energies within the current electricity market is barely 5%."
"Alongside that, nuclear energy amounts to 30% of the market but in this case you do not plan any systematic investigation."
"I do not therefore see how we can possibly understand this, if the logic of your energy policy is supposed to be fair, treating all forms of electricity production alike."
"I must therefore ask you to justify your position since, as far as I am concerned, and also many others, most especially the renewable energy industry, it is a position which is extremely difficult to comprehend."
"Thank you, Mr Turmes."
"I am very aware of environmental requirements, as I was even in the previous Commission, when I proposed the directive on the taxation of energy products, and I try to adopt the same approach in my activities within the Prodi Commission."
"I very clearly understand your concern, but permit me some observations."
"The proposed new framework for state aid to the environment is very flexible with regard to the granting of aid to renewable energies."
"It authorises aid of at least 40% of eligible costs in the case of investment, and for operational aid the Member States are entitled to adopt a system authorising aid up to 100% of eligible costs."
"I do not think, therefore, that you can accuse the Commission of banning aid to renewable energies."
"There is some competition, again permit me the observation, not only between renewable energies as opposed to conventional energies, but also between the various forms of renewable energies."
"Aid to these forms of energy may, moreover, vary according to the Member States."
"Unregulated aid would therefore engender distortions of competition, which could have an adverse impact primarily on certain forms of renewable energy."
"The Commission recognises that renewable energies may need support in order to be able to develop but, at the same time, it is also important for these forms of energy to adapt gradually to competitive markets in order to ensure their long-term development."
"Question No 45 by (H-0383/00):"
"Subject: Financial aid given to the European nuclear industry What assessment has been made by the Commission of the financial aid given to the European nuclear industry - in the form of support for Euratom and the Joint Research Centres - in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the European Union?"
"Community action within the context of the Euratom Treaty complies with the provisions of the Treaty and relates, in particular, to the financing of the Commission's tasks: protection against radiation, monitoring safety and research."
"As far as the latter is concerned, Community programmes for nuclear research are established by the Council which, pursuant to Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty, acts unanimously on Commission proposals."
"In this context, the activities of the JRCs are intended, in conformance with its mission, to increase protection and nuclear safety, and in particular, provide scientific and technical assistance to the competent directorates-general."
"Article 305 (ex Article 232) of the EC Treaty establishes that the provisions of this Treaty do not derogate from the Euratom Treaty."
"This is particularly true in the case of the competition rules, which do not derogate from the framework established by the Euratom Treaty regarding Community nuclear research."
"Therefore, the Community research policy under the Euratom Treaty does not contradict the competition rules laid down by the EC Treaty."
"Commissioner, you have failed to answer my question."
"I want to know what assessments you are making on financial aid."
"This relates to the previous question by Mr Turmes as well and the answer you gave to that in respect of competition policy on electricity production in the EU."
"I conclude from your answers both to my question and the previous one that here we have not just a white elephant in the nuclear industry in Europe but a holy cow."
"You can provide state aids that are untouchable, even by a Commissioner as powerful as yourself!"
"But let me ask you what exactly is the situation?"
"You said that under the Treaties there are derogations - and you quoted the Euratom Treaty."
"There is clearly a distortion between Member States because of the state aids."
"Where exactly in the Treaty are the written permissions for these state aids?"
"Could you elaborate on that please?"
"I shall try, Mrs Ahern."
"First of all, if you allow me, I have here a note in French."
"I should like to emphasise that the Commission does not rule out applying the rules of Community law on competition to public interventions in favour of nuclear electricity producers."
"In its illustrative nuclear programme according to Article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, in particular, the Commission very clearly indicated that ""Developments towards the liberalisation of the Community internal electricity market will mean that nuclear energy will have to compete in the same framework and under the same conditions as all other energy sources."""
"A full implementation of the internal market and a rigorous application of the relevant state aid and competition rules implies a level playing field for all energy sources."
"Once this principle has been established, it is up to the Commission to investigate on an individual basis any allegations according to which the nuclear sector is in receipt of subsidies engendering unfair competition."
"I may add that the services I am directly responsible for within the Commission are of the opinion that it is necessary to keep to a strict interpretation of the Treaty."
"Competition rules are applicable to all electricity producers, including the nuclear sector, insofar as they do not depart from the terms of the Euratom Treaty."
"I consider this position to be all the more justifiable since the directive liberalising the internal electricity market does not stipulate any specific rule for nuclear producers and does not make any distinctions on the grounds of the source of the electricity produced."
"Commissioner, you say that neither the Treaty nor the directive on the internal electricity market stipulate any exemptions regarding subsidies to the nuclear sector."
"On what part of the Treaty, then, is the exemption that you are still allowing the nuclear industry based?"
"Articles 87 and 88 make no reference to nuclear energy."
"So it is not very clear what your legal basis is for exemptions for electricity generated using nuclear energy."
"I believe I have given you all the information available to the Commission on the subject."
"I can add that, on the operational level, as indeed I think I said in response to your own question, Mr Turmes, on existing aid to the nuclear industry, the Commission is not undertaking a comprehensive investigation."
"If, however, cases of incompatible aid are brought to our attention, then these cases will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the two treaties."
"I would further like to add that in the logical overall construction of the EC Treaty, the articles governing state aid, i.e. Articles 87 and 88, are not restricted to specific sectors."
"Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 46 to 83 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Commission."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Carbon dioxide emissions from new cars"
"The next item is the report (A5-0128/2000) by Mr González Alvarez, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars."
"Mr President, there are few of us here at this time in the evening, but it is also true that this is the third time we have debated this report in the European Parliament."
"On the first occasion, in December 1998, this report on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars was approved at first reading with 48 amendments."
"Of those 48 amendments, the Council and Commission accepted some in their entirety and others only in part."
"The report therefore returned for a second reading."
"The Council had accepted certain amendments which we considered to be important, but there remained certain aspects of the report and the amendments approved unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - and by a large majority in plenary session - which we also considered to be important and which had not been accepted. We are basically talking about the inclusion, in this scheme to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars, of lightweight industrial cars, which are used widely within cities and whose carbon dioxide emissions also pollute."
"It also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data."
"For a scheme of this nature, rigour and comparability, in terms of the data collected by the governments, are essential."
"It also seemed very important that we maintained something that was traditional in the positions of the Committee on the Environment: a certain degree of precaution in relation to voluntary agreements."
"If we bear in mind that Community Law - directives and regulations - is often not complied with, it seems to us all the more unlikely that voluntary agreements will be complied with."
"The Committee on the Environment had little faith in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the establishment of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed."
"They also finally accepted our concern that one of the paragraphs should not only mention the stabilisation of emissions, but also their reduction."
"Another amendment which we felt was important concerned the dimensions of vehicles."
"Mr President, in total, 10 amendments were approved by a substantial majority in this House and then not accepted by the Council, and we therefore had to embark on this conciliation procedure, which I must point out has been neither difficult nor controversial."
"As its very name indicates, the conciliation procedures require each of the parties to give some ground so that a final agreement can be reached."
"In this final agreement, our main concerns have been addressed."
"It includes a study of the future inclusion of lightweight industrial vehicles, the possibility of shortly presenting a proposed legal framework and reviewing the data with a view to making them more rigorous and more or less equivalent in each of the countries."
"In short, Parliament' s main concerns have been taken up, if not in an immediate and radical manner, at least to the extent that a commitment has been given to adopt decisions on this issue in the future."
"The only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to dimensions of vehicles."
"Parliament continued to insist that this was very important because the more powerful and larger the vehicle, the greater its level of emissions, and we considered it important that this be included in one of the annexes."
"However, bearing in mind that another six issues relating to the capacities and conditions of the vehicles have been accepted, we felt that we could not prolong the conciliation process any longer, particularly considering that we want this study on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars to be implemented immediately in each of the countries."
"Finally, I believe that this is a reasonable agreement, which is neither Parliament' s nor the Council' s initial proposal."
"Mr President, I believe that we will have no problem ensuring that this agreement is approved."
"Mrs González Álvarez, conciliation processes vary in difficulty, I can assure you."
"I am glad that this one has gone smoothly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by congratulating Mrs González Álvarez."
"She really is most persistent, because we had a very good report at second reading as it was, but she was determined to incorporate more proposed amendments and I really must congratulate her on succeeding in doing so."
"Parliament has asserted itself against the Council once again."
"The introduction of this sort of monitoring scheme is just one of the many steps on the path towards compliance with the Kyoto protocol."
"Reducing greenhouse gases by 8% in comparison with 1990 is therefore the main objective between now and the year 2012."
"The dramatic change in the climate has been noticeable here in Strasbourg over the past two days and is far greater than we assumed."
"It will therefore come as no surprise if we adopt this report unanimously tomorrow, as will certainly be the case, and that the Council and Parliament have been able to find a common position so quickly."
"This joint monitoring scheme is the first of its kind and I think that its success or failure will decide whether or not we opt to introduce other similar schemes."
"We have taken recourse to a three-part strategy in order to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption: environmental agreements with the car industry, a system of tax incentives and a system of labelling for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions."
"But despite all these efforts, directives and joint measuring schemes, we should not delude ourselves: we are unlikely to achieve the target objective of reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels."
"Some experts are advising us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels."
"That may well be pessimistic but if we consider that the number of cars on the road is continuing to rise in the 14 Member States, oh excuse me, I meant 15; we Austrians often have to stop and ask ourselves if there are 14 or 15 Member States, but there are in fact still 15, and if we consider enlargement to the east and if we consider that people in China and India also want to live as we do, then we should make no mistake: it will be difficult to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases or CO2 and we should therefore make every effort to stabilise them at the very least."
"Despite all the pessimism, introducing a pan-European monitoring system for CO2 emissions will not do any harm."
"Let us try yet again with one small step at a time and perhaps the House will sit in 2005, when we need to examine the initial results, and complain that perhaps we did not do enough today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, trust is good, control is even better, as the Head of State of a now defunct system used to say."
"Nonetheless, once in a while these words of wisdom fit the bill because our CO2 strategy for cars is of course a new departure in that we are trusting in the willingness of car manufacturers in Europe, Korea and Japan to take voluntary technical measures to reduce CO2 emissions from their cars to 140g by 2008, which will represent a reduction of around 25%."
"But we do still need a control mechanism so that we can intervene if necessary."
"Hence: trust is good, control is even better."
"We want a statistically perfect control instrument at our disposal and in this respect I thank the rapporteur for her persistence in establishing a reasonable control instrument for CO2 emissions from cars in Europe which applies to all Member States, which clearly shows which vehicles are registered where and what their CO2 emissions are, so that we can see clearly in 2003 if the manufacturers' undertakings are being respected or not."
"And if they are not, then we must take legislative measures."
"I should like to refer to another two pillars in our strategy: the question of labelling, which has been dealt with and the question of additional tax incentives for low-consumption vehicles, which is still a somewhat weak point."
"I think that all of us, especially of course the Member States, need to give clear additional incentives, so that we really can achieve our objective of 120 g in 2005."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur on the excellent results that she has achieved and to begin by placing this report in the broader context of climate change."
"Since the Rio de Janeiro Conference and then Kyoto, the European Union has always led the political side of the debate on climate change."
"Nevertheless, although Europe continues to lead the debate in terms of rhetoric, it is beginning to lose the legitimacy to do so in a credible way."
"It is rather pointless for the European Union to try to alarm the whole world with this problem when, in reality, the European greenhouse gas bubble, in particular the carbon dioxide bubble, is more likely to increase by 6% to 8% than to decrease by the 8% that we agreed in Kyoto."
"It is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts."
"In terms of political action, the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons."
"Firstly, because, according to the Green Paper published by the European Commission, this sector will not be part of the European trading system for carbon dioxide emissions, and all greenhouse gas reductions will therefore have to be achieved exclusively through national and Community policies and measures."
"Secondly, because transport is the sector that is contributing most to Europe' s falling short of the levels set in Kyoto."
"According to a study recently published by the European Environment Agency, transport is responsible for almost 30% of the European Union' s total emissions, and it predicts that the level of carbon dioxide emissions generated by this sector will increase by 39% of the 1990 level by 2010."
"Given this extremely disturbing picture, which shows that road transport is responsible for 85% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector, and given the overwhelming need for action, the agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee on this system for monitoring CO2 emissions from light passenger vehicles is to be welcomed."
"This system is a crucial aspect in the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in new passenger vehicles by 25%."
"I regret the fact that it has not been possible to include light commercial vehicles in this system."
"In any event, I congratulate Mrs González Álvarez once again on the results she has achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I intend to be as brief as our successful rapporteur in the conciliation procedure."
"However, let me just offer her my hearty congratulations on her excellent report and brilliant success, as some of the previous speakers have done."
"Contrary to some previous speakers, I think it is most important that the report should seek not just to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases but to reduce them, especially given the fact that we need to achieve a demonstrable success by 2005 under the terms of the Kyoto protocol."
"I think it is fundamental, given the reservation which this Parliament has always expressed in connection with voluntary obligations in environmental agreements, that we have managed to include the passage stating that data will be used from 2003 onwards to monitor the voluntary obligations of the car industry."
"I also think that it is fundamental - and the scope is not extended by this decision - that we have managed to bring the Commission so far down the line that it is looking into implementing harmonised measurements for the specific CO2 emissions from class N1 vehicles and presenting proposals to this effect."
"I think that is a huge success."
"I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report."
"Mr President, I welcome the excellent result reached by the European Parliament and the Council on this dossier."
"I congratulate the co-legislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement."
"The process leading to the approval of this proposal constitutes a prime example of how the two arms of the European legislature can settle their differences and work together towards adoption of sound and effective environmental law."
"I should like to seize the opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for its constructive approach."
"The adoption of this decision will allow the effectiveness of the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars to be monitored and, more specifically, it will provide credible data to monitor the implementation of the voluntary agreements with car manufacturers."
"This strategy is one of the most concrete activities of the Community on CO2 emissions and reductions from the transport sector."
"Therefore it represents an important milestone in the achievement of the Kyoto target."
"Mr President, unforgivably, I have forgotten something."
"It will take me just 20 seconds to express my gratitude to all the members of the Conciliation Committee: to Mr Provan, to Mrs Jackson, who also participated, and to the members of the Commission and the Council with whom we worked in order to reach an agreement on the report."
"Furthermore, I would like to thank all the MEPs for their support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Interoperability of the trans-European rail systems"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports, tabled by Mr Savary on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism:"
"(A5-0112/2000) on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation and effects of Directive 96/48/EC concerning the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system;"
"(A5-0113/2000) on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system."
"Mr President, I hope that the two members due to speak before me were not travelling by train and have been delayed."
"I think they are in the House and will arrive in time."
"Unfortunately, the fact of the matter is that we are fighting numerous problems on the railways which are a legacy from the past."
"For example, in 1970, the railways' share of the freight traffic market was 21%, compared with just 8.5% now."
"The railways have lost out massively in freight traffic and their share of the passenger traffic market has fallen from 10 to 6%."
"The winner has been road freight traffic, which is increasing constantly and winning market shares: 16% per annum on the eastern borders of Austria, for example."
"It is now 2.4 times higher than in 1990."
"If you take lorries and buses from eastern Europe on the A1 motorway, which is the most important east-west route, traffic increased sixfold between 1995 and the year 2000."
"In other words, freight traffic, especially transit freight traffic, is growing massively."
"According to forecasts, it will rise by more than 100% between 1995 and 2015."
"That is why it is important and urgent that we concern ourselves with the European rail network."
"It totals 156 000 kilometres in length, of which 78 000 km are accounted for by the TEN network."
"12 600 km of new lines for speeds of over 250 km/h should be constructed by 2010, with at least 16 300 km of lines due to be upgraded for speeds of over 200 km/h. The total costs - and they are huge - are estimated at EUR 186 billion between now and 2010."
"So it is obvious how important this investment is for the European Union and that is why we are being called on here to set the priorities quickly."
"I think that it is high time we adapted the railways to the market economy, so as to ensure that the railways invest more money more often in customer requirements and that we can jointly set the priorities and draw up a tight, efficient timetable."
"The main requirements are, of course, to harmonise the gauge throughout Europe, especially where more than two countries cooperate."
"At the moment, we still have five different gauges."
"We need uniform electrification, especially in relation to voltage and frequency."
"In other words, the technical properties of the electricity must be brought into line so that extra electricity can be bought from the national grids and fed into the national grids without any significant losses."
"The third, and I think the most important point is the safety of trains."
"We really do need external inspection and certification agencies."
"We cannot have a situation in which the agency operating the railway is also responsible for inspecting it."
"No-one questions the fact that cars and lorries are inspected by external certification agencies."
"I think there is an urgent need, given the recent train crashes, for external inspection agencies to look after the safety of passengers in Europe."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank all the Members who supported the rapporteur in his work in presenting these two reports which are, I believe, absolutely crucial to the future of the railways."
"What is the subject matter?"
"The first report analyses the application of the 1996 Directive on the interoperability of the high-speed rail system, drawing the lessons of this for the future."
"Next, and this is the substance of the second report, we must discuss and vote on a proposed directive on the interoperability of the trans-European conventional rail system."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must appreciate the full importance of this subject."
"There is today an unacceptable contradiction between what is said in speeches and the reality of European transport systems."
"As might have been expected, the creation of the internal market has, logically, considerably developed the trade in goods and the mobility of persons within the Union, which have shown an increase of 21% and 15% respectively between 1990 and 1997."
"The bulk of the traffic from this explosive growth in internal mobility, which is expected to be consolidated in the next few decades, has been acquired by road systems and, secondarily, maritime cabotage via the North Sea."
"At a time when we have right here, in most of the countries of the Union, a rail network and technology unparalleled in the world, with a recent study evaluating the external costs of road transport in terms of public health, infrastructure and pollution at some EUR 480 billion, even though the objective of sustainable mobility and respect for quality of life are now shared by all Europeans, it can be noted that rail has only an 8.6% market share for freight, and 5.8% for passenger transport."
"There is more than one explanation for this paradox: rail' s reduced level of competitiveness due to a social differential in relation to the road sector, but also the distortions of competition engendered by the considerable external costs of road transport, the priority which most major railway companies in recent years have given exclusively to prestigious high-speed passenger transport, but also excessive national characteristics in terms of railway traditions, techniques and protocols, thereby compromising the flow of continental rail traffic."
"Today, the situation of the European transport network situation is simple to the point of caricature: there is only one common area in transport and that is the road network."
"There is no longer any single airspace or European maritime area, nor especially a continuous railway area within the countries of the Union."
"The issue at stake in railway interoperability is, of course, doing away with the technical frontiers that have been inherited from the national railway structures set in place gradually since the nineteenth century."
"Today, the Europe of the Fifteen has no less than sixteen electric signalling systems, six electrical voltages, five track gauges and several equipment and therefore infrastructure gauges."
"Of course, the new high-speed train infrastructures offer a prime area for the introduction of interoperability, since they are new or recent networks devoted to very similar technology."
"Directive 96/48 was adopted for this purpose."
"The report on its application, four years on, referred to Parliament to express an opinion, delivers contrasting results, but results that are in the end more positive than they may seem."
"In the first place, significant delay is observed in the transposition of laws and regulations since, to date, only two countries have transposed it and the first technical specifications for interoperability are on the point of being completed and published."
"The conclusion is therefore that the time limits for transposition and publication must be more stringent in future."
"This delay in transposing into law has not, however, hindered the development of interoperable cross-border lines, although Thalys is the only example of true interoperability, more so than even Eurostar, despite its attempts to solve the gauge problem."
"These two international lines have established a precedent which can serve as a model for future developments."
"More than that, however, in anticipation of tangible results in future, the directive on the interoperability of high-speed routes has primarily made it possible to define and iron out working methods."
"For the first time, the railway industry, rail companies and infrastructure managers have started up a joint project to define the technical specifications for interoperability."
"They have worked on the basis of the most general studies by the International Union of Railways."
"Within the European Association for Railway Interoperability (EARI) they have set up a working group which now has methods and experience available for transposition to conventional systems."
"Finally, the Committee established by Article 21, bringing together representatives of the Member States and the Commission, enables political and technical monitoring of interoperability projects and intervention at the discretion of states to direct such projects."
"In other words, while the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism felt bound to remind the Member States of their obligations in terms of time limits and transposition, it must be admitted that the high-speed systems have provided a first-rate testing ground for the vast worksite of interoperability."
"In this respect, we have to bear in mind that the network and the conventional stock present problems for harmonisation that are formidable in other ways, due to the national and historical characteristics of networks, the great diversity of the stock, and the considerable extent of the networks."
"It must be made quite clear at this point that there is no question of insisting that rail companies and infrastructure managers immediately proceed to replace their equipment comprehensively. This is totally out of reach, economically."
"In the first place, if the goal is to achieve interoperability, this must entail using the fastest and least costly means to achieve decisive progress."
"In this respect, interoperability may be achieved by methods other than the harmonisation of equipment, since it is possible to adapt equipment to operate in different configurations, following the example of the quadruple-system locomotives."
"This is a proposal for a pragmatic and realistic approach which would not detract from railways' competitiveness in relation to other modes of transport by imposing additional costs."
"The key principles of this proposed directive are as follows: restriction of the geographical area covered by conventional system interoperability to the trans-European network as defined by the 1996 European Parliament and Council Decision; a policy of gradual convergence rather than systematic renewal, taking the form of phasing in priorities and interoperability, establishing a hierarchy for subsystems to enable the fastest and cheapest access, with priority only to new investment for creating, extending, renewing, maintaining and operating systems; establishing a hierarchy of objectives, distinguishing across-the-board objectives to be included in all standards: safety, reliability, health, environmental protection and technical compatibility; the objectives inherent in each technical subsystem: infrastructure, energy, rolling stock, etc.; the separation of the technical task of framing the TSIs assigned to a joint representative body, from the standardisation work entrusted to the European standards institutes, and the inspection and certification entrusted to notified bodies; a policy of user consultation, as suggested by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism which cannot be envisaged, ladies and gentlemen, without concomitant consultation of staff representatives, the subject of an amendment that we shall be discussing tomorrow; finally, ongoing monitoring of these projects by the Member States and the Commission through the Committee established under Article 21, implemented by the high-speed directive, enabling states to request exemptions, to include special cases in the technical specifications for purely historic or regional networks, as well as certain types of equipment originating from third countries, and also instruments for authorising commissioning operations notified by Member States to the Commission."
"In other words, there are safety valves for countries with a high level of special characteristics, and, within the institutions stipulated by the directive, they still have the opportunity to argue the case for these special characteristics and to have them included in the studies and in the TSI publications."
"Finally, during the transition period, it is important to prevent the networks from growing further apart."
"To this end, new investments, between now and the publication of the TSIs, shall have to comply with authorised technical references."
"A Union rolling-stock register will be set up, making it possible to identify the rolling stock, its renewal and ageing, in the same way that this is still carried out, albeit imperfectly, for the maritime fleet."
"Furthermore, we have to look to the future and, therefore, both the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have proposed involving candidate country representatives in the projects at this early stage, so that they can anticipate this future acquis communautaire."
"Similarly, and this is a recommendation that we make, we should already be planning conditions of interoperability between the various modes of transport, in accordance with our general objective of developing intermodal interoperability."
"It would, of course, be presumptuous to expect everything to be achieved by this directive and the long-term upgrading work it requires from railway operators."
"Quite clearly Europe is proposing to undertake a long-term and very large-scale project throughout its vast railway network."
"It cannot single-handedly solve the problem of distortions of competition or of network access or charges which would represent crucial progress towards a new golden age of rail in Europe."
"All the same, the technical interoperability of our old national networks is indeed an essential condition for the recovery of rail, which this balanced, reasonable and flexible text should make possible to achieve in gradual phases under acceptable economic and social conditions."
"To the many of you who contributed to this, let me reiterate my gratitude and my appreciation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Savary, and all the members involved for their excellent and constructive cooperation on this difficult, purely technical subject."
"The number of proposed amendments tabled, including here in plenary, shows how important this issue is for Europe, which is why I can also praise the Commission for addressing the subject of the interoperability of conventional trains as well as of high-speed trains."
"I think it is a pity that few Member States have transposed the interoperability directive with regard to high-speed trains and I call on the Commission to exert pressure to prevent the loss of valuable time which is costing the railways in terms of market shares and competition."
"The directive is even more important where conventional trains are concerned."
"The aim of the directive - as with high-speed trains - is to harmonise technical provisions in order to ensure that conventional rail traffic within the Union runs as smoothly as possible and to give candidate countries really exact specifications so that through traffic is also guaranteed after enlargement."
"Interoperability will also have many advantages for both passengers and freight transport."
"Better services, greater comfort, less travelling time, increased safety and possibly also lower prices."
"The harmonisation of technical standards is also needed for the long overdue liberalisation of the railways."
"Both together, interoperability and liberalisation, are most important if the railways are to survive in the internal market."
"I am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good, common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that."
"This applies above all to the initially highly disputed derogations from the TSIs, but also to the social dimension of this directive, where we were finally able to achieve a compromise."
"Nonetheless, - and we in the group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats continue to believe that we are right here - generally-worded social aspects do not belong in this purely technical directive, even if the Commission and the Council may think otherwise."
"We are likewise opposed to involving passengers in working out TSIs."
"Including these aspects will only result in the directive being difficult or impossible to manage."
"Finally, a few other proposed amendments have been tabled, which we consider are quite simply too bureaucratic and have no positive aspects to boot."
"In short, our group is against any elements which are counterproductive when it comes to achieving the important objective of an efficient European railway, as outlined above."
"Allow me in closing to highlight the excellent cooperation once again;"
"I am optimistic that together we shall achieve the objective of creating as smooth a railway system as possible."
") Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Savary on his drafting of such excellent reports."
"This is an important topic, but also an extremely complicated one."
"Mr Savary has taken good account of the views of others."
"My group supports improvement of the competitiveness of railways and liberalisation of competition."
"The first stage is to create the conditions for uninterrupted movement of trains over the entire region of the European Union."
"Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSIs) and common standards are a sine qua non for the development of railway interoperability."
"The rapporteur has quite rightly adopted a gradual approach."
"Technical solutions can vary a great deal."
"The competitiveness of railways should not be undermined by the imposition of additional economic burdens, even though common standards will lower costs in the longer term."
"Existing differences between national railway systems will make necessary some exceptions in the harmonisation of railway systems, so that no Member State shall have to face inordinate difficulties and so that current railway transport will not be jeopardised."
"This report outlines a course of action by which these exceptions can be accepted without jeopardising the principal objective."
"There is one further matter which would require fine tuning; this was outlined in Amendment No 35 by my Group."
"It applies to Finland in particular, but some of the applicant countries will be faced with the same problem in connection with enlargement of the Union."
"The matter referred to concerns Russian freight wagons, where technical solutions are applied which differ from those of the Member States, inter alia in the area of couplings and brakes."
"They are not necessarily inferior, but different."
"Russia is hardly about to change its standards in order to comply with the requirements of the Union."
"For Finland, this is an exceptionally major issue."
"Due to historical reasons, the track gauge in Finland and Russia is the same, but it is different from that in Europe in general."
"Russian wagons account for approximately 40 % - almost a half - of Finnish freight transport."
"The reason for this high percentage is that we do not want to take the risk of sending Finnish wagons to Russia, since experience shows that they are so very rarely returned."
"Russia, of course, is a country which leans heavily on rail transport, with a rolling stock which must equal that of the entire region of the EU put together"
"In the review concerning point 5 of Article 5, Mr Savary proposes that when considering special cases, particular attention should be paid to the rolling stock of third countries."
"This proposal is very good, but the solution remains half-finished, as far as Finland is concerned."
"It will lead to unnecessary and laborious inspections of Russian wagons and to massive bureaucracy."
"There is no certainty either that Russian wagons in all instances would be regarded as special cases."
"This is why we have tabled an amendment of Article 7, which simply aims at making it possible to use third country freight wagons for traffic, as long as they do not cross the border between two Member States."
"This is the addition referred to as point f in the Committee' s amendment."
"Implementation of this proposal would give assurance that rail traffic in Finland could continue without becoming drastically reduced."
"Mr President, Environment Commissioner, I am pleased that you are here because we can now address this matter straight away."
"We are evidently debating a highly technical subject matter, namely the interoperability of both high-speed and conventional rail systems."
"This gives me the opportunity to make a few comments on the environmental dimension to this proposal."
"Today, we are essentially witnessing one of many historic moments which those who work in the sector, as well as those who are in favour of trains, have waited for for a long time, because at the end of the day, all this is, of course, meant to culminate in technological harmonisation, which entails the harmonisation of international rail, labour organisations, train drivers who have to make international rail journeys, etc. This also means that employers' organisations and trade unions will have an entirely different role and outlook with respect to this work."
"In short, the proposal has a knock-on effect on many other areas and it will be some time before it is a reality."
"Certainly if I look at the high-speed link and its technical specifications, I share Mr Savary' s view - who has drawn up an excellent report - that it is scandalous that three, nearly four years after the previous directive on interoperability of the high-speed link, we are still waiting for technical specifications for interoperability."
"This does not bode well at all for the future."
"What we are aiming for in the long run with this rail proposal is to attempt to cut down on traffic jams but also, more importantly, to benefit the environment, safety and a number of other aspects."
"It has to be said, and I have already mentioned this several times within other fora, that the rail system is gradually losing its environmental edge, not so much because it does not take any initiatives itself, but more so because we ourselves prescribe few, if any, specifications for example, regarding the use of diesel-electric locomotives, the type of electricity used, etc."
"What we would like, and this is why we welcome with open arms the dual speed for technical specification requirements, is for this technical specification to at least take account of energy consumption and air pollution, something which will require a great deal of hard work."
"The second important point is of course the social dimension, as I touched upon a moment ago."
"I regret that we are confining ourselves to the bare minimum, i.e. working conditions."
"We refer to a social dialogue but we should really take it one step further, because this affects the entire labour organisation of railways."
"I would urge you to look into the positive experiences which certain countries have had in changing the labour organisation of the rail system, in order to bring about a more efficient rail system and to set up exchange programmes, so that we can learn from experiences in countries which have struggled in the past, and which are often still struggling where other elements of the rail dossier are concerned, such as liberalisation or fair pricing."
"Mr President, despite European integration, the rail system is disintegrating."
"It is increasingly hard to obtain international rail timetables and it is often the case that train tickets to remote destinations have to be bought outside the country of departure."
"Not so long ago, it was possible to take a direct train from Cologne to Athens, from Paris to Lisbon or from Amsterdam to Copenhagen."
"This is now a thing of the past."
"Meanwhile, railways are, however, in the process of being re-discovered."
"The times when trains were seen as a burden inherited from the nineteenth century, something that can be neglected and dismantled, are fortunately over."
"Almost everyone admits that trains should once again play a key role in European long-haul transport for people and goods alike."
"This is not just necessary to meet the increasing demand for transport options, but mainly to curb the tide of cars and aeroplanes which form a threat to the environment."
"The views on how to modernise the rail system are strongly divided."
"For a long time, it was fashionable to apply everything that had contributed to the emergence of cars and aeroplanes to trains."
"According to this line of thinking, everything should come down in price and should become flexible, so that price-based competition has a less detrimental effect on trains."
"Some people still advocate that everything should be privatised and liberalised, that the influence of trade unions must be restrained and that railway personnel should perform more work for lower wages."
"According to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, these remedies are worse than the disease."
"These would reportedly lead to further decay of the railway business and deterioration in the quality of services, and would force personnel to strike more, for reasons of self-preservation."
"The real solutions must be sought in a completely different direction."
"For starters, there should be better cooperation between the existing national railway companies in the management of frequent and fast cross-border routes."
"In the case of the conventional railway system, the routes Brussels to Amsterdam, Hamburg to Copenhagen and Dublin to Belfast are good examples of this."
"The passengers are unaware that it is two companies who are responsible for this one joint and frequent link."
"This could also apply to the extensions of the French high-speed links in England, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany which are running under the names ""Eurostar"" and ""Thalys""."
"To guarantee success, it is important not to bring in a whole ream of new commercial businesses, which would lead to bad connections and variable pricing."
"Furthermore, the money to finance such a high-speed network should not be found through cutting down services on short-haul routes in the individual Member States, as many people are indignant - and rightly so - about the huge amount of funding being ploughed into fast connections for the benefit of a small, privileged minority."
"The construction of new high-speed links will continue to meet with protest if the ordinary domestic train user only ever experiences higher prices and fewer facilities and if they do not solve the environmental problems caused by cars and aeroplanes."
"Needless to say, technology should be better harmonised by means of common mains voltage, joint equipment, fewer changes for passengers at borders and uniform safety requirements."
"Privatisation and fragmentation according to the British model offer no guarantee whatsoever that those improvements could be better accommodated than if we were to keep the present state enterprises."
"The position of the one million employees in the European rail system must be protected."
"They are people who offer useful services to each and every one of us."
"This is why they should not come at the bottom of the list in our railway policy, as is sometimes advocated, I regret to say, by those in favour of a commercial approach."
"My group would like to see trade-union rights, participation, working conditions and work pressure given a more prominent role."
"Luckily, the rapporteur is not yielding under the pressure to consider personnel as a cost factor alone."
"I am pleased that Mr Savary' s proposals help strike a happy balance."
"Mr President, Mr Savary' s reports raise a matter of crucial importance to European railways."
"Given the alarming position rail finds itself in in most Member States, intervention is vital."
"It is of utmost importance to drastically reduce the obstacles created for international traffic by inconsistencies in the different types of equipment and networks used."
"The harmonisation of the physical networks for the conventional rail system is a step in the right direction and certainly deserves support."
"Nobody can deny its importance."
"Despite this, I am of the opinion that a great deal of the work done by Members is superfluous."
"Most of their wishes have already been incorporated in some shape or form in the text of the directive."
"This should not be done again."
"Furthermore, we are dealing with a directive here, which means that it makes little sense to include too detailed and intricate specific cases."
"This directive is extremely technical in nature and its main objective is to facilitate the use of all kinds of trains using all kinds of networks."
"This is why comments concerning personnel do not really seem to fit in here."
"Only clear agreements on qualifications for personnel who will be deployed on cross-border routes are necessary."
"The curbing of the freedom of enterprise should not go further than strictly necessary."
"In short, Mr President, I will certainly support the idea contained in the reports, even if certain proposed elements are not appropriate in this context."
"A very good evening Mr President, Commissioner. It is unusual, but you know that I have the highest personal regard for you and am therefore delighted to see you here this evening."
"Interoperability is a fundamental issue and, if we take it seriously, the time has come to admit that the European Union has failed over recent years."
"We have made no progress whatsoever with interoperability."
"I think it is extremely important that we again inform the Council, where everything is diligently recorded, that 40 years after the creation of the European common market, we have made no progress in the railway sector."
"I hope that the draft report by Mr Savary, whom I should like once again to thank for his draft, and I should also like to thank my colleague Mrs Jeggle for her shadow report - I hope that if we manage to persuade the Commission and Council to accept the draft report, we shall be reasonably well placed for the future."
"I also hope that the Council will accept our proposed amendments."
"We have taken a great deal of trouble and Mr Savary has also tabled umpteen proposed amendments for the plenary sitting, which we support, in order to achieve a report which the Council can accept, thereby avoiding a conciliation procedure and second reading."
"I hope that the Council will do so and I call on it to act responsibly."
"Having made no progress whatsoever with interoperability for years now, the Council should accept our decision tomorrow so that we can make some progress and avoid yet another second reading and conciliation procedure."
"The difficulty which must be acknowledged is, of course, that the internal market can only function if we have uniform systems in the long term and we must ensure that we really do make progress here."
"I also call on industry in Europe to abandon the policy it has pursued over recent years of separating off its national market by deliberately not manufacturing rolling stock which can be used in other countries."
"Everyone has staked out their own market, which is why we have this fragmented railway market in Europe - and this is unacceptable."
"Allow me one more closing comment. Mr Swoboda, who is about to speak, and I shall soon be discussing the Railway Pact here in the House."
"We are opening the markets but we need interoperability in order to do so."
"These are two aspects of the overall complex and I therefore hope that the Council really is wise and clever enough to accept the proposed amendments which we shall probably adopt by a large majority tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, we are, in fact, in a situation in which we are building up a European railway system, albeit somewhat late."
"Mr Jarzembowski and I hold such similar views that I should like to begin where he left off."
"In a few weeks' time, we shall propose to Parliament at second reading and by a large majority - there are still a few differences of opinion here and there - what framework market conditions and operating regulations are needed in order to create a European railway system."
"All this, as the previous speaker has already said, will not produce a European railway system unless there is also a degree of interoperability on the technical and social side."
"It is grotesque: every private company, even small private companies, think European nowadays."
"It is only on the railways that we have not managed to achieve this and we are now endeavouring to bring about a European attitude."
"The comment about industry is correct."
"We always look spellbound at America, at the United States, where industry and, of course, the free market economy are also promoted by the state."
"Except that, when it comes to American companies, the situation is quite different."
"In Europe, uniting in a common European market is proving to be an arduous task."
"How can we expect European products to be used throughout the world, when we are cannot even agree on certain technical conditions and interoperability in Europe?"
"In this sense I should like to offer the rapporteur, Mr Savary, my full and unequivocal support and congratulate him on his excellent report."
"What we need is technical interoperability."
"That has already been said."
"Industry has its part to play here, but of course clients, i.e. the European construction companies, must also do what they can to force industry to cooperate."
"This also applies, and here I disagree with a number of previous speakers, to social comparability and alignment."
"Of course, that does not mean that everything will become identical, because we do not want a situation with one side more or less exploiting the other; we want a situation in which we look together to see how we can bring about a European railway system."
"Safety is also, without doubt, an issue."
"The huge advantage of the railway is that it is safe and environmentally-friendly."
"Just as it is a pity that the transport Commissioner cannot be here, it is a good sign that the Commissioner for the environment is here, because, in the final analysis, traffic, and railway traffic in particular, is a means to an end and not an end in itself and it should help to improve our environmental situation."
"Mr Savary has also highlighted a very important point; namely that we must ensure during the enlargement of the European Union that the European railway system does not stop at the current borders of the European Union but covers the whole of Europe so that it can help to improve the environment and increase traffic safety throughout Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these reports make it quite clear that we are flying the flag for the transfer of traffic from road to rail in vain. If there is no technical follow-up, then our demands will obviously remain a dead letter."
"Actual observations today point to the fact that rail in Europe is not matching up to its ambitions and, I would add, it is falling far short of our ambitions."
"It is true that in a good number of European policies we put forward the need to transfer passenger transport, but most especially freight transport, from road to rail in order, on the one hand, to comply with our international commitments but, on the other hand, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to reduce environmental pollution in general, to relieve congestion on the roads and to reduce the social costs of road transport, which are borne indirectly by the community as a whole."
"For all these reasons, none of them new ones, the European Union must make it possible to take up the challenge."
"In relation to the reports on interoperability it must be noted that the train was not considered to be the transport of the future which was going to provide the solution to a number of problems, particularly environmental problems."
"In transport policies within the European Union, rail was overlooked."
"As evidence of this I would cite the considerable amounts of Structural Fund, trans-European network and Cohesion Fund aid allocated to roads and motorways, which for far too long have had more than their due."
"Only rarely was there a question of allocating aid to conventional rail systems in order to modernise them and so that they might compete, particularly with heavy goods vehicles on the roads."
"The declining figures for rail transport, particularly for freight, bear witness to the lack of investment at this level."
"In the race to develop infrastructures, rail has been the great forgotten area."
"Fortunately, there are now crucial studies which make it possible to justify the urgent need and the relevance of investing in rail."
"Moreover, we would point out that it is essential that the European Parliament should incorporate staff training and health and safety conditions into this directive."
"Indeed, many of us still remember the conditions in which the transportation of radioactive waste between Germany and France was carried out for many years."
"Because they did not know about radioactivity, and were not informed about it, some members of staff at the Woippy marshalling yard, in the Lorraine region, used to gather round these heat-generating carriages to keep warm in winter."
"The chemical containers which we would also like to see transported by rail also require specific training in order to guarantee general safety as well as to prevent exposure and handling which may prove dangerous to the health of the operators involved."
"In general, then, we consider this report to be a well-balanced one, and we also wish to congratulate the rapporteur, but we have nonetheless tabled a number of amendments in order to improve it still more."
"These are to do with taking account of social dialogue, which we deem essential."
"I would urge you to support the amendments to this effect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members present in the House, Mr Savary' s report is an excellent piece of work and he deserves both thanks and recognition."
"I should like to focus in my speech on three aspects and I am sorry that Mrs Jeggle and Mr van Dam take the opposite view on two of these aspects."
"First, liberalisation of the railway networks in the Member States and the establishment of a common market for railway services is addressed from the point of view of free access and transit rights for the infrastructures of the Member States in cross-border traffic, especially freight traffic."
"And new technical specifications for interoperability are at the forefront here."
"In my view, the proposed extension to the concept of interoperability, by including questions such as the professional qualifications of staff and the need for health and safety regulations at the workplace, is of paramount importance and a vote in favour of the report by my group depends on it."
"Most national railway systems in the Member States have comprehensive rules governing the aforementioned social aspects and rather than lose them in the process of liberalisation at European level, we must harmonise them at the highest possible level."
"At this point I should like to support the call for more authority to be given to the merely advisory voice of the social partners in the sectoral committee and for the European social partners to be granted equal decision-making powers similar to those in many national regulations, when resolutions are passed."
"Secondly, in addition to agreeing to the minimum level of technical harmonisation proposed in the report, the preparation of ex ante cost-benefit analyses and the order of priorities for drawing up TSIs, my group sets particular store by including the social partners, associations and organisations, passengers and users in the work of drafting and checking technical specifications for interoperability."
"Thirdly, we also support the proposal to allow representatives from the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe to attend committee meetings from the outset."
"The plan to involve them in the process of discussing and setting TSIs from the outset is important if the technical standards and specifications of future candidate countries to are to be brought into line early on with current developments in the EU."
"This will allow us to ensure ahead of time that the infrastructure in these countries can keep pace, thereby helping to minimise the separate costs which the European Union would otherwise incur."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Savary report follows the rationale of sustainable development."
"As we consider interoperability to be essential, we support this report, and offer our congratulations to Mr Savary for the pertinence of his observations."
"The road-rail balance must be adjusted by means of a carefully calculated interoperability."
"In the long term, the increase in heavy goods transport will cause enormous problems, such as congestion, the construction of new routes, and problems of safety and pollution."
"It is absolutely essential, in this eventuality, to have recourse to rail transport."
"The problem is even greater for countries located at strategic crossroads, such as France, where the saturation of the road networks is yet another argument for the crucial need to put interoperability into practice."
"The models of Thalys and Eurostar must be extended and intensified with the new high-speed train routes: TGV-East to Germany, Southern Europe-Atlantic to Madrid and Lisbon, and South-Mediterranean to Barcelona."
"As for conventional rail networks, it is time that interoperability was made compulsory, reinforced by considerable amounts of European aid which would, moreover, enable Member States to safeguard their conventional local networks."
"Interoperability is all the more necessary as rail transport is profitable over long distances."
"So border stops, changes in equipment and staff and, more importantly, transhipment operations should be limited to avoid putting a strain on reliability in terms of the time and service provided."
"Airfreight manages perfectly well without border stops."
"So let us adapt."
"We shall not be able to upgrade the competitiveness of rail unless we bring in stringent constraints."
"Interoperability must be made compulsory, particularly for the new networks that are being built, even if the TSIs have not been finalised."
"We cannot afford to delay any longer before actually implementing this measure which will acquire even greater significance with the enlargement of our Community."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a great deal has been said in today' s discussion."
"In my view, the most important points to be borne in mind are two figures, which are really quite shocking."
"The first is that in 1970, the railways had a 20% share of the freight market, whereas today they have just 8.5%."
"The second figure concerns the average hourly speed of railways in Europe, which is 16 kilometres per hour."
"And all this in the year 2000!"
"Evidently, we need an immediate political response from the 15 Member States of the European Union."
"Before such a response can be given, we first need to understand the problem and we need the corresponding political will."
"In my view, and of course this is the view of all those who have spoken today, we need to take steps as regards network compatibility and interoperability, because we have different technical specifications, different standards and different management systems."
"And of course, we all endorse the report by Mr Savary, whom I would once again like to commend on his work."
"However, it is not enough for us just to forge ahead with interoperability."
"We need to consider the entire railway liberalisation package and combine this with interoperability. In this context, I would like to say that the Helsinki Council resolutions may well be satisfactory, but they are inadequate."
"If we want to make headway, then we need to adopt the opinion expressed by the European Parliament at first reading, because it deals more fully with the problem which, as is already quite clear I think, is a particularly acute problem."
"We should all realise that a common market without a unified transport network is simply will-o' -the wisp."
"So if we want to examine the problem in its entirety, we need to have, and to provide, the necessary responses."
"I would like to add two separate issues concerning my country, Greece, since my capacity as chairman of the Transport Committee does not, I imagine, deny me the right to raise problems of this kind."
"The first problem is that Greece has no main cross-border rail links, especially with other Member States."
"On the contrary, it has important cross-border rail links with third, non-EU countries, which are not bound by Community legislation and, consequently, employ their own national standards and systems and will no doubt continue to do so in the shorter or longer term."
"This is certainly an issue which merits special mention and regulation so that the European harmonisation we are working for does not prove to be detrimental to the cross-border rail networks of countries such as Greece."
"Another issue I would like to touch upon is that special provision should be made for peculiarities and differences caused by the geographical location and topography of various Member States such as Greece, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, etc., whose remote or island nature causes particular problems."
"Mr President, I too regret the absence of the Commissioner here this evening."
"Perhaps she is stuck at Brussels airport."
"Perhaps she should have taken the train."
"I begin by welcoming the Commission's proposal to integrate Europe's convention on a high-speed rail network."
"I thank the rapporteur for his patience, his skill and, above all, his commitment to the cause of Europe's railways."
"I would also like to thank the Portuguese presidency for its skilful handling of this very complex dossier - an example of Europeans working together to solve common problems."
"This problem, I believe, can only be solved satisfactorily at EU-level."
"What is the problem?"
"As we have heard already this evening, in 1970 the railways had a 21% share of the freight market, today just 8.5%."
"In 1970 the railways had a 10% share of the passenger market, today just 6%."
"If these trends continue just 4% of travellers will go by train at the end of the decade and rail freight will all but disappear."
"The sad fact is that the railways have lost ground even where there are well placed, for example, in long distance freight."
"The very future of our railways is at stake, together with the jobs of one million people employed in the industry."
"A key reason for this decline is that, in contrast to aviation and road haulage, a single market does not exist in this sector."
"For 150 years, the railways have been organised along national lines."
"Even the opportunity of electrification further divided Europe's railways because there are now five different systems in operation."
"More recently the railways have adopted 16 different and incompatible electronic signalling systems."
"That all adds costs and it means railways cannot compete."
"Differences have also contributed to the fragmentation of the market for railway equipment."
"This proposal being considered here tonight, together with other proposals from the Commission, aims to create an internal market in rail services."
"It will help achieve a harmonisation of technical standards for equipment and rolling stock and the integration of national networks to boost cross-border traffic."
"That will make the railways more efficient, reliable and more competitive."
"It would also boost the railway equipment industry in countries such as my own."
"It will contribute to the fulfilment of our aim of switching freight from the congested and polluted roads to Europe's railways and encouraging the development of more high-speed rail services to take the place of short-haul flights."
"The revitalisation of the railways is crucial to the future of Europe's transport system, our environment and our economy."
"That is why Mr Savary's report deserves our full support."
"Mr President, Commissioner, like aviation, the present issue is reminiscent of air traffic control."
"It is high time that the Member States forsook their national stances in favour of a European stance because it is national stances that have prevented the rail system from being vital and from retaining its passengers and freight. Instead, we are now faced with the opposite."
"Mr Savary' s excellent report is the first in a whole series of reports which will deal with the rail system and its liberalisation, which is essential, in my view."
"Trains should not be confined to internal borders within a large European market."
"I think that is important."
"Liberalisation and competition should be introduced within this large European market."
"That, in my view, is the best solution for customers and services."
"If the best solution had been cooperation between national companies, then they would have done this a long time ago and we would not be faced with this long-standing problem, namely that rail transport is on the wane."
"For a country like mine, and several other Members have spoken about their own countries, it is, of course, essential that we have one European market with technical unity or 'interoperability' , to use a buzz word."
"Indeed, a small country is vulnerable in that respect, but a country which lies at major intersections is even more vulnerable to this."
"I think that we need to take sound steps and take them fast."
"A difficult issue was that of personnel."
"Mr Savary, I welcome the compromise that we were able to reach in that respect."
"It is, of course, important for health and safety to be regulated and not compromised over, and this is also true, of course, of training. We should be very clear about this too, so as to ensure that these issues are brought into line."
"I am left with one question, namely I wonder whether we are sufficiently ambitious, as indeed, we are only referring to trans-European rail systems."
"In my opinion, however, if we harmonise trans-European rail systems, we should also do the same for national rail systems."
"This is especially important for those people who manufacture trains and train equipment."
"We need, as a matter of urgency, to create a European single market in that respect too, and this will only be possible if we harmonise trans-European, i.e. international, as well as national traffic."
"As such, we need to ensure as soon as we can that we create rail systems modelled on the HST, such as Thalys and Eurostar, which do not stop at borders but which carry on."
"This should also be possible for ordinary trains because if not, Mr President, we are heading for a traffic nightmare."
"Indeed, if we do not breathe new life into the railway sector, we will always have that traffic nightmare hanging over us and it is absolutely essential that we resolve this matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin, as some previous speakers have done, by thanking Mr Savary - the author of these two reports - for his work on achieving harmonisation, which has been difficult, but which has looked to the future. His task has certainly been difficult, and this has been demonstrated by the conflicting interests expressed during tonight' s speeches."
"As a Spanish MEP, I would have preferred the task to have been achieved with greater flexibility and certain technical specifications which affect structural issues within the railway system not to have been applied."
"I am referring specifically to the Spanish rail gauge, which, since this is a problem affecting the basic railway structure, we believe would involve a costly and slow renovation, and its particular circumstances need to be taken into account."
"This means that it should not be regulated by means of the so-called 'specific cases' , subject to committee decisions, but that, on the contrary, we should consider the possibility that automatic derogations should apply depending on the incompatibility of these technical specifications with existing lines."
"We therefore hope that you will be receptive to this request because, otherwise, we should bear in mind that all the projects, all the development plans for the rail networks affected by these specifications, would be subject to difficult conditions, and this would have a negative effect, since it would create uncertainty in relation to the planned investment programmes themselves."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I recently visited the newly constructed Öresund Bridge which links Sweden and Denmark and which is, of course, a part of the European transport network."
"It means that a fixed link is being created between Scandinavia and the continent."
"The bridge will make it considerably easier to convey people and goods from Sweden and Finland to the rest of Europe."
"However, we have a problem, at present, with different voltage systems."
"In fact, the power has to be taken away from a portion of the track so that the trains are able to alternate between the different voltage systems in Sweden and Denmark."
"We have different gauges in Sweden and Finland."
"The only railway linking the two countries is that between Haparanda and Torneå."
"Gauge switches are now being tested there to make it easier to cross the border."
"However, there are also some extremely good examples of other systems."
"The ore trains which travel from northern Sweden to northern Norway have just the one driver to take the train across the border."
"This works well because the countries concerned have cooperated with the employers and employees."
"Within the EU, we now have fifteen different and separate railway systems which are often incompatible with one another."
"This means that, within the railways sector, we have neither free movement nor a common market."
"If we are serious about creating an international, competitive railway, we must also create a common railways structure within Europe."
"Coordination of the railway systems is especially important for those countries and regions which are not situated in the centre of Europe."
"In order to be able to travel right through the EU, Swedish trains, for example, must be able to pass through several countries and, thus, several national railway systems."
"At present, this involves an obvious competitive disadvantage and means that the centrally situated countries within the EU should be urged to coordinate their various systems."
"For the same reason, it is also important for those countries bordering the EU to be able to be involved in the work on harmonisation so that there are no restrictions upon transport to and from third countries."
"If compatibility is to be achieved, the specifications of a range of technical components need to be brought into line with one another."
"What, however, is at least as important in terms of this change is that coordination should also be achieved within the operational and administrative systems, that staff should be duly trained and that there should be agreements in place to enable drivers to take trains across the national borders."
"Road traffic in Europe is increasing each year."
"It creates problems in the form of environmental damage, noise, overcrowding and accidents."
"In order to be able to cope with this trend, methods of transport must become cleaner, quieter, safer and more efficient."
"Railways are the means of transport which now best meets these requirements."
"Rail transport must therefore become more attractive and competitive."
"In order to reach that point, however, the railways must be able to compete on the same conditions as other forms of transport."
"The Savary report is therefore very important and one step along the road."
"It is now just a question of all the Member States turning it into a reality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, honourable Members, literature has a few well-known words for what we are discussing in the two Savary reports this evening: ""You are late, but at least you are here"" , was how Friedrich Schiller put it, words which also apply to our work here in the European Parliament."
"To discuss the interoperability of the conventional trans-European railway system at the end of the 20th century, just as everyone is getting ready to leave, looks bad, even if, admittedly, interoperability has increased."
"But still!"
"It has taken more than 100 years for us to pluck up the courage here and give the railways another chance."
"And yet the facts do not look very promising."
"The rapporteur has included figures in his report which are all the more significant for being so thin on the ground."
"Mr Hatzidakis has already told us that the railways had a 21% share of the freight traffic market in 1970 and now have a mere 8.5%; in passenger transport, their share has fallen from 10% in 1970 to 6%."
"The prospects for high-speed trains are somewhat more encouraging, although here too, not everything in the garden is rosy."
"It is true that we have at least got something on the rails in western Europe, namely Thalys and Eurostar."
"But where we want to network Europe in the long term, especially with the future Member States of the Union, things do not look any better."
"Yet it is vital to win over Eastern Europe, which still makes relatively good use of the railway network, to interoperability with Europe before everything switches to the roads."
"Incidentally, this must be done through dialogue with the candidate countries, as the Savary report rightly stresses."
"On one point, there is a need for nostalgia: we want to maintain a small part of the history of Europe and keep historic railway lines in their original state."
"We shall leave them out of the scope of our directive and the friends of the railway will thank us."
"Interoperability is rightly not required where regional demands and solutions need to maintain their own legislation within the framework of subsidiarity."
"In this context, a word to my Austrian Minister of Transport."
"The southern railway in Austria is an old stretch of line and is of regional importance."
"But, more importantly, it is the north-south link in the east of the present Union."
"If we do not invest in it, the east of Austria will run the risk of economic exclusion in the future."
"That is in nobody' s interest."
"Austria is excluded from the Union at present more than enough as it is."
"Let us end all forms of isolation and ensure that we have comprehensive interoperability in the Union."
"(Applause from various quarters)"
"Mr Rack, I repeat what I said to Mrs Flemming at the start of the night sitting: from an institutional and legal point of view, under the Treaty, Austria has every right to be in the European Union."
"Therefore, let us deal with this issue when other points are under discussion."
"Mr President, I believe that Gilles Savary has done magnificent work with these two reports."
"The routes of the railway structures on our continent were set a long time before Schuman made his famous speech on the Quai d'Orsay."
"In those days, military factors were given priority over the transport of people and goods."
"In my country, Spain, as in Russia, a different gauge to the rest of Europe was chosen in order to make a possible military invasion more difficult, which proves that European construction was not the priority for those people who took the decisions on railway routes."
"Furthermore - as others have said - almost every country has constructed its network in a radial manner, around its capital, which is a serious obstacle to all those who want to create a different kind of route, such as from Spain to Germany or Italy to the UK without passing, for example, through Paris."
"Paris and many other capitals and almost all intra-European borders act as barriers for through rail routes."
"For this reason, the transport of passengers and goods by rail has been suffering for decades."
"We have managed to harmonise the European economy, but the current rail network is not a useful instrument for the single market."
"Therefore, we resort to road transport, despite the fact that it creates pollution and is dangerous."
"We must free the citizens of Europe from the road monopoly by offering them working railways throughout the Union which are competitive in relation to other modes of transport."
"The inclusion of a social clause seems to me to be an excellent idea."
"The railway workers are going to play an important role in interoperability and their interests must be addressed in the text of the directive."
"These workers have already paid the price for our forgetfulness."
"Their number has decreased by 500 000 in the last 15 years."
"It is possible to revitalise the railway, as certain projects that have already been undertaken demonstrate."
"A Community which is undergoing a rapid process of integration and which is facing imminent enlargement needs to improve the efficiency and quality of the railway services it offers to customers."
"As Mr Savary says, this would contribute to achieving the objective of sustainable mobility and greater social and economic cohesion in Europe."
"Mr President, one of the European Union' s key goals was the creation of the internal market, but this market has created a volume of traffic which is growing at an alarming rate."
"Despite this, we need to ensure that goods and people arrive at their destinations faster, more efficiently, at cheaper rates and in cleaner conditions than before. Rail transport is not really a great help in this respect, quite the reverse, in fact."
"Let us be honest, the train has remained stuck in the nineteenth century."
"In percentage terms, trains have certainly not retained their share in transport."
"We can only hope that they have retained it in real terms. Trains have proved the European Union right: more competition keeps you alert and on the ball."
"Well, due to a lack of competition as a result of excessively protectionist behaviour on the part of the Member States - and I am not ashamed to admit this - the train has been condemned to a second-class position even in this century, also in terms of technology and even durability, which certain Members have emphasised."
"Trains are not durable and they are no longer clean, especially the diesel locomotives."
"We have finally reached a point in Europe where we are about to try to bring about a change in mentality."
"This is desperately needed, and about time too, for the sake of both the people and mobility within the European Union."
"We can no longer rely on road transport alone for it is fraught with problems, pollution, traffic jams, increased risk of accidents, as well as the problems which an increasing number of people are facing with the swelling flow of through traffic zooming past their doors."
"If the rail systems can overcome the obstacles facing cross-border transport, i.e. by using each other' s rail infrastructure and if they make their equipment more durable, then this will relieve the pressure on road transport."
"Rail systems develop extremely slowly."
"In France, for example, this is because the government protects its own market and in the Netherlands, it is because we never manage to bring a procedure to a close and to start doing the groundwork."
"As a result of this, planes are still used in Europe for short-haul distances."
"Naturally, high-speed links such as those from Paris to Brussels should have superseded the plane a long time ago, but because of the vulnerability and sluggishness of the present trains, many prefer to take the plane."
"It is not just manufacturers and governments that should be represented during the decision-making process pertaining to rail systems - in respect of which, incidentally, there is much room for improvement - but also the railway companies themselves."
"This is already the case in the technical field, in the form of the European Association for Railway Interoperability."
"This should also be the case for railway legislation, right across the board."
"After all, railway companies have the necessary in-house expertise and need to be involved in the entire process."
"The requirements for admission to the railway network and cooperation between the railway companies and the EU leaves a great deal to be desired."
"Take, for example, the night train from Amsterdam to Milan which will be introduced from 28 May."
"This route covers Germany, Geneva and Italy."
"Each country has its own set of rules regarding speed, safety and travelling comfort."
"Only if these requirements are met can access be gained to the railway network."
"This beggars belief, especially if the rules change and are adapted virtually by the day, as has been the case."
"This makes the interoperability of the European rail systems almost impossible in practice."
"What we need are harmonisation and standardisation as soon as possible, if we want to create a true internal market for rail systems."
"Mr President, the vast majority of investments that have been made in the EU' s infrastructure have been made at national level."
"As a result, a lot of things work well within our countries."
"However, the deficiencies become apparent as soon as it is a question of crossing a border."
"In spite of the fact that there have been several attempts to solve the problems, partly within the International Railway Union, this is especially the case in the area we are discussing here this evening, namely that of Europe' s railway networks."
"As long as we have obstacles of this kind, there will also be clear limitations of at least two different kinds."
"Firstly, there will be a deterioration in the prior conditions of Europe' s being able to compete with other markets where these problems have perhaps already been solved. Secondly, there will be a deterioration in the prior conditions of the railways' being able to compete with other types of transport."
"There is no doubt that the railways have been the big losers in recent decades, and remain so."
"From a position, thirty years ago, when it had a more than twenty per cent share of the goods transport market in the EU, the railways are now down to having a share of less than ten per cent."
"At the same time, the market share for passenger transport has almost halved."
"It is just not an option to force goods or passengers back onto the railways."
"The railways will become winners in the market if they become efficient and are given the opportunity to develop by their own efforts."
"Otherwise, there is an obvious risk that Europe' s railway network, at least where goods transport is concerned, will no longer exist within a few decades."
"For this reason, it is a step in the right direction when the Commission seeks so-called operational compatibility within the railways sector."
"The next step is to help extend the EU' s internal market to embrace the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, too."
"Common operating systems and businesslike pricing should benefit Europe' s railway networks but, if the railways are to survive in the long-term, at least two additional things are required."
"Firstly, a diversity of operators is required."
"Just as there are many haulage contractors on Europe' s roads, there ought also to be many competing railway companies."
"Secondly, a distinction needs to be drawn between the national operator and whoever owns the track."
"That is the model we have in Sweden, and I believe in fact that it would be marvellous if similar systems could be introduced in all the EU' s Member States."
"Otherwise, the confusion between public authority and operator will continue to be an obstacle to the development of Europe' s railway networks."
"In general, this means that an awful lot remains to be done even after the decisions which the European Parliament is making in conjunction with the present report. These nonetheless constitute extraordinarily important steps in the right direction."
"I would like to speak on this particular subject but from a regional aspect."
"I cannot speak about high-speed railways in Northern Ireland, never mind the island of Ireland, because the railways do not go at any great speed in that particular part of the world."
"It is extremely important that we recognise the importance of a railway system."
"One thing that has concerned me recently in my region is that, in Europe, we talk about how important to regions it is that we should have the most environmentally friendly type of transport. At the same time within my area people are talking about doing away even with parts of our present minute railway system."
"I find that totally atrocious."
"We have one of the main links between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland between Dublin and Belfast."
"This is a very important link and one that has been upgraded recently."
"Probably that would be up to at least half the standard of the rest of continental Europe, but it is very welcome to those of us who live in that area."
"Then we have the link between Belfast and Larne which links us to the rest of the United Kingdom."
"Parts of this have had to be closed down because there is not enough money to keep it in repair and upgraded."
"We have also recently had Northern Ireland Railways tell us that they are going to close the link between Coleraine and Londonderry which is absolutely unbelievable and totally unacceptable."
"This is the one commuting area from the Northwest and it takes in part of the Republic of Ireland and the inner shore and peninsula."
"They need that railway system as a link for those who want to get to Belfast to reach airports and everywhere else."
"So we have to take a really serious look at what we are talking about here."
"For too often within Europe we have talked about trans-European networks - be they road-rail, air or sea - but at the end of the day we are not prepared to put in the finance at either European level or national level."
"We have to take on board the challenges that come before us and we have to ensure that we have a very highly established rail link."
"I certainly want it within my region because that is important."
"There should be no more closures and we should make more finance available to improve the present railway system to have more goods moved by rail and not by road, which is totally unacceptable from an environmental point of view."
"It is hurtful when I go back to my region and am told the money is not there."
"It is hurtful when you go back and you are told that: ""No, we must improve the road system - we must not improve the rail system""."
"The rail system has a tremendous future."
"It is wrong, it is totally unacceptable that it is allowed in any way to be run down."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wishes to begin by thanking you for this interesting debate and thanking Parliament for the fact that you attach such great importance to the question of the interoperability of the conventional rail transport systems."
"I want to highlight the excellent contribution which has been made by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, especially by MEP Mr Savary who has prepared the report."
"The directive must be seen, in the first place, as a technical measure, but the proposal is, of course, also of political significance in so far as it helps implement a common and open market for railway services and railway materials."
"As is well known, the Commission has made the railways sector into one of its priority areas for taking action."
"This was especially made clear in the 1996 white paper on the revitalisation of the Community' s railways."
"As early as the end of last year, the EU took a large step towards revitalising railway transport when it introduced the so-called railway package."
"I am convinced that this can contribute to a renaissance for goods transport in the Community."
"Above and beyond these measures, further efforts are required if the strategy is to be complete."
"By this, I mean primarily measures which integrate the national networks and increase the quality of the public services."
"We all know how different the various countries' technical standards and operating regulations are."
"This has also emerged clearly in the course of the debate."
"This makes international transport both more expensive and more complicated than domestic transport."
"These differences affect not only interoperability but also the internal market for railway equipment."
"The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted an amendment to the report and, in that way, backed our own proposal."
"Most of the amendments to the report are acceptable."
"A series of amendments entail actual added value, something for which we wish to thank Parliament."
"As you know, the Council too has examined the proposal and, thanks to contacts between Parliament' s rapporteur, the Presidency of the Council and the Commission' s officials, it is entirely possible that the proposal may be adopted as early as at first reading."
"A prerequisite for its becoming a reality is the desire to pursue a genuine convergence policy even where an essentially technical document is concerned."
"When it comes to the amendments, I only wish therefore to deal with those which are unacceptable."
"First of all, Amendment 9, Article 1(3)."
"The area of applicability is established in Annex I and cannot be limited in the way proposed."
"Those cases which are mentioned may be dealt with as special categories, as special cases or, at worst, as exceptions."
"Amendment 28, Article 22(3)."
"The proposed change is incompatible with the idea that the technical qualifications for interoperability are to be introduced gradually."
"Nor does it fall in with the need to prioritise those measures which provide the greatest benefits in terms of cost."
"Amendment 29, Article 24(1)."
"Where this is concerned, there are legal obstacles to acceptance."
"Amendment 32, Annex I, together with Amendment 35 on exempting passenger carriages from third countries."
"The proposed wording is unacceptable because it means a fundamental change to the rolling stock referred to in the directive."
"The principle which the Commission upheld before the Council and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and upon which the proposal is based is that the directive must embrace all rolling stock used on the trans-European railway network."
"This is important for the purpose of promoting the internal market for rolling stock and also for the purpose of guaranteeing a minimum level of safety the length of the trans-European railway network."
"In order to achieve this minimum level of safety, all rolling stock must fulfil certain minimum specifications."
"Amendment 39, Article 18(3) and Amendment 40, Annex VII."
"The proposed measures are incompatible with Article 14(2) which specifies that it is the Member States' responsibility to make sure that the system complies with the STI, or spécification technique interopérationnelle, regulations."
"This proposal could be introduced into the framework directive concerning railway safety which the Commission will be introducing later this year."
"Clearly, however, exceptional instances of transportation or, for example, locomotives involved in track maintenance do not need to fulfil the same requirements as passenger trains."
"The proposal therefore mentions a number of special cases (cf. Article 2 K and Article 5(5)) where special, suitably adjusted regulations may be applied."
"Allow me to leave the other amendments, because they all have our support."
"They help make the directive clearer, especially the special cases."
"Otherwise, they involve acceptable supplementary provisions, for example certain cases exempted from the technical specifications."
"I would conclude my intervention concerning the interoperability of the conventional rail systems by thanking Parliament for its efforts."
"We must hope that it will be possible to adopt the directive as early as at first reading."
"The directive will take on a key role when it comes to revitalising railway transport."
"I now move on to the second report, which concerns the interoperability of high-speed trains."
"In this case, too, Mr Savary has prepared an interesting report containing a number of constructive observations and proposals."
"The Commission will examine them in detail and, as far as possible, take account of them in planning its activities."
"The Commission' s report was more concerned with the implementation and effects of Directive 96/48 than with the actual progress made towards the interoperability of high-speed trains."
"This has to do with the fact that the railway network in question is still at an early stage of development."
"Parliament' s proposal for carrying out an assessment of how much progress really has been made on interoperability is therefore very interesting."
"Where the conventional railway network is concerned, the Commission proposed that a common representative body should provide, and regularly update, a facility to help monitor progress."
"At the request of a Member State or of the Commission, this would provide a picture of the trans-European rail system for conventional trains."
"The Commission has examined all the proposals in the report on the interoperability of high-speed trains, and they constitute a welcome contribution to the Commission' s ongoing deliberations in this area which continues, of course, to be given high priority."
"It is generally known that the railway sector is of crucial importance in terms of Europe' s future transport needs and a more sustainable European transport system."
"Increased interoperability is a key factor in our endeavours in this area."
"It is very pleasing to have it confirmed through today' s discussion that the European Parliament and the Commission see the issue in much the same way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we and the rapporteur, Mr Savary, have gone a long way towards accommodating the Council by including umpteen proposed amendments here in plenary in order to reconcile the two versions."
"The Council should accept our opinion and the Commission should support us, not the Council, Commissioner."
"Secondly, please be so kind as to point out to your employees that the report is not from the Committee on Regional Policy, but from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, because we are devising a transport policy for the whole Community, not just for the regions."
"Mr Jarzembowski, the name of the committee is the ""Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism""."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"British Nuclear Fuels at Sellafield"
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0223/2000) by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to the Commission, on the installation of the MOX demonstration facility at the British Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield."
"Mr President, the report on safety at Sellafield, published by the UK Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, is a damning indictment of safety at the plant and falsification of safety checks there."
"In mid-February Chief Inspector Laurence Williams said that he himself would pull the plug on the THORP reprocessing plant if his safety recommendations were not acted on."
"However, it is clear from his own report that BNFL cannot be trusted."
"The response to previous recommendations by the NII was to ignore them."
"Indeed, I have documents showing this to be the case as far back as 1981."
"This shows arrogance, even when they are called to account."
"What are we to make of the fact that this investigation by the UK Nuclear Inspectorate resulted from a press report in the UK Independent, following which the UK Government sent in a posse, as it were - the Nuclear Inspectorate."
"Surely it should have been the other way around."
"We received continuous reassurance regarding the safety of EU nuclear installations, so why does it need a press investigation to alert Member State governments to serious safety issues?"
"It is time that the citizens of Europe received detailed answers to the questions of the effect on safety and the environment of the falsification of data in the MOX facility at the BNFL Sellafield site - falsification that has been ongoing for some years - because of the seriousness of the questions it raises for the safety of MOX fuel in use and for the nuclear installation's safety generally."
"It also raises questions for the transport of nuclear material such as MOX fuel and, indeed, for nuclear safeguards because of the production of plutonium stockpiles."
"Indeed, I would ask what level of Euratom safeguard efforts, personalities, site visits etc. has been deployed on that site since 1996 since when, we are told, reprocessing in the UK has been performed under Euratom safeguards?"
"I questioned Chief Inspector Laurence Williams in committee on whether the inspectorate staff in the UK were going native and imbibing the cultures that they are there to control."
"He gave me a serious answer."
"However, what about Euratom inspectors?"
"Can we trust them?"
"Do they also imbibe the cultures that they are there to control?"
"I would also ask you to deal seriously with the harmonisation of minimum standards, because here we received conflicting answers in committee."
"I am also directly concerned with the effects of reprocessing on neighbouring states, such as my own, where radioactive contamination from Sellafield has been found on the east coast beaches, in particular Carlingford Lough, where I grew up."
"Local people often ask me what the EU is going to do about it."
"I can give them very short answers."
"Denmark and other Nordic states are also concerned at the radioactive contamination of their seas and fishing grounds from reprocessing at Sellafield."
"I believe the scandal of abuse of safety at Sellafield is a European question."
"In particular, the high-level waste tanks pose a serious, on-going risk to the east coast of Ireland because of the risk of a release of large amounts of radiation should the cooling tanks overheat."
"The Nuclear Inspectorate's report stressed that the amount of high-level liquid waste continues to increase faster than BNFL can deal with it."
"The THORP reprocessing plant produces continually more waste."
"It is this plant that the inspectorate threatened with legal sanctions if the backlog is not cleared."
"Reprocessing by its nature produces large quantities of liquid waste."
"For more than 40 years high-level liquid waste has been stored in tanks at Sellafield under constant cooling."
"It is now urgent that we cease reprocessing and that the high-level waste tanks be shifted to passive containment such as vitrification."
"Even then, they will still be highly radioactive for more than 50 years."
"The problem for BNFL is that the amount of high-level liquid waste produced by reprocessing continues to increase faster than it can deal with it."
"The NII would like to see the minimisation of the amount of high-level liquid waste stored in order to reduce the potential hazard."
"I would suggest that this could be done by ending reprocessing now."
"In committee I also queried whether a culture of corruption had spread to the independent quality assurance verification by Lloyd's Quality Assurance who verify that BNF procedures comply with health and safety requirements."
"Last September it published a report stating that BNFL has high-quality management in terms of health, safety and the environment."
"As this was clearly inaccurate, according to the regulator's report, this independent verification now lacks credibility."
"I have already talked about going native in regard both to Euratom and the UK inspectorate."
"This is the polite euphemism for corruption, and that is what we must control here."
"The Chief Inspector recommended that the high-level waste tanks and the serious risk resulting from the inability of BNFL to make them passively safe through vitrification was an urgent issue."
"I would ask what does ""urgent"" mean in this context?"
"Must we wait for years more of serious risk to the health and environment of people in the British Isles and Europe generally?"
"The Commission is informed of the events surrounding the falsification of the pellet diameter data at the MOX demonstration facility and the BNFL Sellafield site."
"We are closely following the developments and have made direct contact both with the UK authorities and with the company."
"The Commission is highly concerned with this event which raises questions in relation to nuclear safety."
"Before I refer to the specific aspects raised by Mrs Ahern in her question, I would therefore firstly like to state that we cannot tolerate any negligence in relation to nuclear safety within the present and greater European Union."
"The neglect of internationally agreed nuclear safety standards should be openly and firmly condemned."
"I am therefore grateful that the European Parliament decided to debate this important issue in plenary tonight and to adopt a resolution later this week."
"Let me now turn to the first specific issue which is the implications of the MOX data issue for the safety of nuclear installations."
"Let me first remind the honourable Members that under the International Convention on Nuclear Safety the responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the state having jurisdiction over a nuclear installation."
"It is also clear that our Member States do not wish to give up this responsibility."
"I therefore need to refer to the UK and the NII report on the falsification of the data which states that the nuclear installations inspectorate is satisfied that the fuel manufactured in MDF will be safe in use in spite of the incomplete QA records caused by the falsification of some AQL data by process workers in the facility."
"That is a quote from their report."
"However, the inspectors' report on the control and supervision of operations at the BNFL Sellafield site also stated its opinion on the deterioration in safety performance at Sellafield."
"The company has reacted to the requirement of the NII to produce a programme responding to the recommendations in the report."
"We are now awaiting the formal reaction of the inspector to this programme."
"Secondly, on nuclear safeguards: according to the investigations carried out by the UK nuclear installations inspectorate, the falsification of data occurred during a secondary manual diameter check of a sub-set of the MOX pellets in the Sellafield MOX demonstration facility."
"As far as Euratom nuclear material safeguards are concerned, checks of the diameter of pellets are not covered since operators' declarations for safeguards are based on pellet weights and not on a diameter measurement."
"Therefore the verifications performed by Euratom safeguards did not indicate that these declarations had been incorrect."
"Thirdly, in relation to the transport of nuclear materials, transport of radioactive material is implemented according to regulations that are elaborated by the IAEA and transposed into national legislation."
"Therefore, also for the transport of radioactive material the prime responsibility lies with the Member States."
"As such the measurement deviations at Sellafield do not have any consequences on the safe transport of pellets."
"However, the Commission welcomes any decision which would increase even further the safe transport of nuclear material."
"The Commission has as its objective to promote the harmonisation of the regulations in the field of transport of radioactive material, which would increase safety in the field."
"Finally, regarding the concept of proposing a Euratom directive for harmonising minimum standards for nuclear safety in the European Union and its value in discussions of nuclear safety with the accession states: individual EU Member States' safety requirements are more specific and demanding than those of the International Atomic Agency."
"Because of different historical background, legal framework, type and numbers of reactors and different approaches to regulation, they cannot easily be harmonised into a set of common rules."
"My concern is that any attempt to achieve a consensus on a set of common Euratom safety standards might only result in a very generalised set of rules and principles."
"As such they would be unlikely to improve on current nuclear installations' safety standards."
"It is therefore unlikely that harmonising minimum standards at an EU-level would have been able to prevent what happened at Sellafield."
"There are, however, several activities at Community level where harmonisation would be both beneficial and possible."
"These activities are based on common recognition of national requirements and the promotion of best practices."
"One area where there is scope for in-depth harmonisation is in relation to new types of facilities."
"I do not see any obstacles to future harmonisation of rules in the field of safe management of radioactive waste and decommissioning of nuclear installations."
"In the context of enlargement, a directive setting out harmonised minimum safety standards might have facilitated our early discussions on the very sensitive issue of nuclear safety."
"As part of the Community's acquis it then would have been routinely screened together with other EU legislation."
"However, it is difficult to say if such a directive would be developed quickly enough to play a key role in the ongoing discussions with the accession states."
"It is also difficult to prejudge if common minimum standards would give us the level of safety that we wish the accession states to aim for."
"We have in fact set our sights and those of the accession states beyond such a level."
"We are working to encourage the applicant states to apply the good practices in use in the European Union."
"One example of this is the development by the DG-Environment of guidelines for periodic safety reviews of the Soviet-designed light water nuclear reactors."
"Another major step forward was taken only last week with the setting up of a European nuclear installation safety group."
"It will bring together nuclear power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both Member States and applicant states."
"I can assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to pursue the objective of a high level of nuclear safety, both within the present Union and an enlarged one."
"I am convinced that more could be done at Community level to achieve this."
"However, it is not clear that a directive requiring the harmonisation of safety standards at a European level at this moment in history is the best way forward."
"It is very important that we retain a sense of perspective, a sense of proportion about this issue and I welcome the balanced response from Commissioner Wallström."
"It is very important that we stick to facts and avoid some of the wilder claims that have been put in the Green motion for a resolution on this issue."
"I want to emphasise that safety was not compromised in the incident of record falsification."
"I would like to quote also from the NII report that the fuel manufactured in MDF, the MOX Demonstration Facility, will be safe in use in spite of incomplete quality assurance records caused by the falsification of some acceptable quality-level data by process workers in the facility."
"The NII takes this view on the basis of the robustness of the fuel manufacturing process and the totality of the checks made on the key parameters."
"I would also like to draw colleagues' attention to the positive response by BNFL to the two reports made by the NII, one on the records incident and the other on the control and safety management regime at Sellafield."
"I welcome the response and their three key recommendations to improve the safety management system and management structure by implementing a comprehensive overhaul of the safety management system across the company. To improve resource availability by taking on more monitoring staff, by improved training and further emphasising the safety culture and thirdly, to improve independent inspection, audit and review by appointing independent senior compliance inspectors and the like."
"BNFL has responded positively to the 28 recommendations in one report and 15 recommendations in the other, the falsification report."
"I do not propose to go through those in great detail."
"I have no time."
"Let us not lose sight of the fundamentals here."
"Regulatory safety mechanisms worked in this instance."
"Members of the staff reported the error and then the regulatory procedures took their course."
"There was no actual breach of safety, only a breach of record-keeping regulations for one particular customer."
"The offence of falsification of records must not negate or obscure the long-term case for reprocessing or MOX fuel assemblies."
"Both of these are forms of recycling."
"Both of them are effective ways of reducing, of concentrating waste and in the case of MOX manufacture are the best answer known presently to the issue of safe disposal of weapons grade plutonium."
"I welcome the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association WENRA which was formed just over a year ago in February 1999."
"I welcome their launching of a project aimed at harmonising its members' safety rules and practices."
"The regulators themselves are undertaking this job across Member States: who better to undertake that task?"
"The result will be an enhanced safety culture and that is to be welcomed by all."
"Mr President, the vast majority of United Kingdom citizens or indeed EU citizens were deeply shocked and dismayed at the recent events at BNFL."
"Let me quote BNFL's own words: ""At company level it has been recognised that in the mind of many stake holders quality and safety are inextricably linked."
"Failure to comply in one aspect of an accredited quality system has led to a major loss in confidence in BNFL overall."""
"That is from a management which is now aware of its shortcomings, a management that foolishly engaged in staff reductions, now reversed thank goodness."
"The highest standards are required of any nuclear installation."
"I have considerable sympathy for the workers at BNFL let down by a sloppy management."
"Their livelihoods were endangered."
"They will now speak out whenever they see evidence of lack of safety culture."
"I do not want to talk at this stage about the viability or wisdom of reprocessing nor about the economics of MOX."
"That is not under debate, although those matters should be debated in the UK and elsewhere."
"BNFL is now in for a very difficult period and deservedly."
"The main reason this is being raised in the European Parliament is to point out the lack of European harmonised standards in the nuclear industry."
"There are harmonised standards in almost every other aspect of European industry."
"The Euratom Treaty is deficient and that must be rectified so that we can have the sort of directive we need."
"We cannot really contemplate enlargement without some sort of acquis communautaire in the nuclear sector."
"The Commissioner says she does not feel it advisable to produce a communication."
"Please come to our committee Commissioner and we can discuss this further."
"I think one is needed in the near future indicating how we could achieve more harmonisation - of course not at the lowest standards in existence but at the most stringent."
"If you want public acceptance - and many of you do - of the nuclear industry, you have to ensure that."
"Commissioner you say that as far as new facilities are concerned, if there are to be any, you feel that there is a case."
"I really do not see the difference, and I urge you to reconsider what you have said this evening to come to our committee, look at this one case as an example of what we need for the public of Europe and for the workers in our nuclear plants."
"Mr President, what the investigations into this incident show is what can best be described as a culture of management incompetence and one of complacency."
"The report by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate in February of this year into the safety records found that these records had been systematically falsified."
"The processing of spent fuel from 34 plants in 9 different countries was thrown into doubt and, indeed, Japan, Germany and Switzerland stopped sending material - and quite rightly so - to Sellafield."
"This whole sorry tale has added to the UK's reputation, as sordid as it is often inaccurate, as the ""dirty man of Europe""."
"I believe that all at Sellafield must accept collective responsibility for the things that have gone wrong and must act to improve them."
"A number of improvements have been made: the new chairman of BNFL has undertaken a fundamental review; a number of people have been dismissed."
"There is undoubtedly progress."
"However, there is a lot yet to be achieved and there is a long way for the UK to go, and for BNFL to go to re-establish its reputation."
"I would ally myself with the concerns of Mrs McNally, when she asked the Commissioner to look again at these matters."
"The fact is that the Commissioner telling us that the rules of individual Member States are more specific is simply not good enough."
"We need high minimum standards and, in particular, we need those standards in the light of the accession of candidate countries, many of which are more reliant on nuclear technology than existing members of the Union and have much older generating capacity."
"The importance of European Union action in this matter is that it will be a confidence-building measure, and what the public want are confidence-building measures."
"I recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark."
"The fact is that we need legislation to implement what is called for in the motion put forward by the three main political groups tonight: high minimum standards for the safe and reliable design, construction and operation of nuclear and nuclear-related installations, as well as for nuclear-safety management systems."
"My group cannot support the Green motion here tonight."
"We feel that it treats the matter in too gargantuan terms."
"It raises the perfectly legitimate question of whether nuclear reprocessing should continue at Sellafield."
"But one cannot conduct this debate in the terms employed by the tabloid newspapers."
"We support the motion put forward by the three major political groups because we believe that improvements need to be made, improvements are being made, but that those improvements will be encouraged by an EU-wide approach to this whole matter."
"We recognise too the great significance of this plant for employment in west Cumbria and we believe that should the future of the plant be thrown into jeopardy then the European Commission must come forward with special measures to help regenerate other employment in the area."
"This is a saga in which nobody, least of all Sellafield, comes out well. But it is an area where action at European-Union level really can make a difference."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking my colleague, Mrs Ahern, for raising this very important issue."
"No one in this House could have been anything but appalled at the recent events linked to Sellafield, with the falsification of MOX fuel data and the Nuclear Installation Inspectorate's report on the low level of safety procedures at the plant."
"Following the initial defensive response by BNFL, it was only when that report was published that the real scale of the problem emerged, that the falsification of figures had apparently been going on secretly since 1996."
"Wales, like Ireland, has suffered from the radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea, due essentially to Sellafield."
"There has been a theory about a link between a high incidence of childhood leukaemia, for example, and proximity to the Welsh coastline."
"Now, added to that, we have a situation where any confidence the public had in the safety of the plant, and therefore their own health and safety, has been destroyed."
"It is this crisis of credibility in the management of British Nuclear Fuels which may actually bring about the end of reprocessing."
"BNFL was determined to press ahead with the Sellafield MOX plant to keep reprocessing going."
"But one of the reasons why British Energy, which accounted for a third of Sellafield's reprocessing work, decided to shift from that to waste storage was on economic grounds."
"It was cheaper for them to store waste, and evidence published recently by the nuclear-free local authorities confirms this view."
"So, with the problems of the environmental pollution and the effects on health, as well as the issue of cost and the debate about the cost, what justification is left for nuclear processing?"
"It is not worth the risks associated with it and, as the resolution states, the Council, the Commission and Parliament must reconsider this whole issue, including the production of MOX fuel, in the light of recent events and in the interests not only of people in Ireland and Wales but also in the whole of Europe."
"British Nuclear Fuels has an obligation to deal with the levels of waste that Mrs Ahern mentioned earlier in the safest way possible."
"That issue too is one of great concern to me because an area of Wales has been mentioned as a possible site for storing low-level radioactive waste."
"This is unacceptable."
"A strategic approach is needed."
"The nuclear industry has caused enormous damage already and we have to be certain that more and more communities and people's lives are not blighted by its legacy in future."
"Mr President, an essential requirement in parliamentary work is rigour."
"For the sake of this rigour, I would like to remind you of four facts relating to the case of the falsification of manual measurements of the diameter of MOX fuel pellets at the British Nuclear Fuels installation at Sellafield."
"Firstly, we are talking about secondary and superfluous controls at the request of a client, not a safety requirement; secondly, no nuclear safety requirement was violated; thirdly, there was no risk of radiation whatsoever; fourthly, no safeguard clause of the Euratom Treaty was violated since the measurements of the weight of the pellets were correct."
"We are therefore talking about a dreadful case of a lack of professional ethics, which has done enormous economic and public relations damage to the company concerned, but this case had no implications whatsoever in terms of the safety of workers or the public."
"Nevertheless, a mishap like this reminds us, despite its trivial nature, of the need to give utmost priority to the constant control and improvement of the procedures in an installation such as the Sellafield reprocessing plant."
"This is the view of the British regulatory authority."
"This is clearly demanded in the resolution supported by our Group and we hope that this will be complied with in the future."
"Mr President, we must not be under any illusion that the falsification of quality control data at Sellafield was not a most serious matter."
"I suspect that the small number of Members of this House who have kept in touch with the plant, both the management and the workers' representatives there over a good number of years, felt the issue more keenly than most."
"It exposed a poor safety culture and an inadequate secondary control procedure in the manufacture of MOX fuel."
"However, we should note that the response of BNFL to the nuclear inspectorate report has already resulted in very significant management changes. These have been welcomed both by the inspectorate and by the minister responsible."
"I hope that in that regard they will not be accused of having gone native on this particular issue."
"I would suggest that one of the roles of Parliament should be to monitor the ongoing management changes that are taking place."
"We should also note that the chief inspector and the Commission made very clear to the industry committee that there were no safety implications at any of the Sellafield installations."
"Nuclear safeguards were not an issue, nor were there safety issues in relation to transport of nuclear materials."
"I am glad that the Commissioner has reinforced that view this evening."
"The fuel can be safely used for the purposes for which it was manufactured."
"But to say all this must not lead us to be complacent."
"We seek to apply standards to the applicant countries in eastern Europe and, I would suggest, beyond the applicant countries in eastern Europe."
"European Union standards applicable to all nuclear installations are still something that most of us want to see."
"We know that the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association is seeking harmonisation."
"I would hope that the Commissioner, as other colleagues have asked, will reconsider her position and actually support and encourage WENRA in this objective."
"I am absolutely convinced, on the basis of my own experience in a number of countries that this is the way to reassure public opinion."
"It is the reassurance of public opinion that must be our main objective as a Parliament."
"Mr President, I have been a Member of this Parliament now for sixteen years."
"I believe I am accurate in saying that literally in every one of those sixteen years the concerns of the Irish Government and the Irish people about the nuclear processing plant in Sellafield have been raised in this Parliament."
"I am always conscious, as I look around, that probably every light bulb in this Chamber is lit by nuclear energy, which explains the reluctance among many of the major European nuclear powers to address seriously the concern we have in Ireland."
"Our concerns have been expressed by successive governments to the British Government."
"They have largely been treated - I regret to say - with indifference and indeed, very often with contempt."
"There now exists in Ireland a total absence of any trust in relation to reassurances about the safety of the nuclear plant in Sellafield."
"The recent information about the falsification of documents just added to the deep sense of unease that is shared by people throughout our island."
"We are a country with all risk and no benefit from this plant."
"We are aware that the Germans and the Japanese are sending their nuclear waste for processing to Sellafield because it is politically too uncomfortable for them to do it in their own countries because of concerns about this."
"I ask the Commissioner to reconsider her point."
"I also ask her another question: are any of the non-nuclear countries on the nuclear safety committee you mentioned?"
"It is time that we realised that we must count the cost of processing the waste from these nuclear facilities as an intrinsic part of the cost."
"It is, generally speaking, more comfortable to leave that out, but this is a matter of extreme concern to the Irish Government, the Irish people and happily, also to the Danish Government."
"We are joined in our concerns by them as well."
"Mr President, I asked to speak in this debate not just because I am a Member from the north-west region of England where the Sellafield plant is situated, not just because there could be 10 000 livelihoods at risk if Sellafield was closed, and not because I have any vested interest in the nuclear industry."
"I do not."
"I asked to speak because I want to try and help to get some truth into this debate."
"The trouble is, when you talk about nuclear issues - especially Sellafield - it is dominated by a distortion of the truth."
"When Mrs Ahern spoke, she spoke of the NII giving a damning indictment of the plant."
"No, it did not!"
"She spoke of the damning indictment on safety checks."
"No, it did not!"
"It made three safety recommendations and the checks were quality assurance checks, as other speakers have said."
"She said the report came from a press statement in The Independent."
"No, it did not."
"The workers at BNFL raised the issue."
"They were the ones who discovered it."
"BNFL were the ones who told the nuclear installations inspectorate and their customers what had happened."
"She spoke of contamination of the seas in Ireland and Denmark."
"I quote from The Independent where seven prominent Danish scientists, who actually study as a professional interest the releases of radioactivity from Sellafield, said on 12 May: ""There is no scientific basis for the claim that the present release of radioactivity from Sellafield causes an unacceptable contamination in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions""."
"When your mind is made up facts only confuse the issue!"
"She spoke of the scandal of abuse of safety."
"That is an absolute insult to the people who work there, and more so to their families who live near that site!"
"Those workers would not work in that plant if they thought it was unsafe."
"They would certainly not put their families at risk it that was the case."
"That is an absolute indictment of those people who work there."
"Then she finished by talking about corruption."
"That really is the last throw of the dice."
"Finally, I say to the Commissioner: the one thing you should do, apart from listen, is to pay a visit to Sellafield and find out the facts for yourself."
"That is the best advice that I can give you and many Members of this Parliament also."
"Mr President, as a Cumbrian - born, bred and resident - and one of the representatives of north-west England, there is nobody in this Parliament who has been more affected by the reverberations arising from recent events at Sellafield than me."
"Let us be clear. There have been real lapses in the way in which it has been managed."
"Those lapses quite simply are not acceptable."
"Speaking as a Cumbrian I know a lot of people in my home county - which I have the privilege to represent - feel let down by British Nuclear Fuels."
"But as has already been pointed out, there have been no breaches of the law or of the regulator's rules and guidelines."
"In a society subject to the rule of law recent events cannot be used to close the plant."
"I know that there are many people who would like to see Sellafield closed down."
"In particular I know this is a very strongly held view in parts of Ireland."
"In a free society, if that is how people feel, they must be allowed to articulate their opinions."
"But that is no reason why the plant should be closed."
"There can be no question of any lawfully established enterprise in any part of the European Union being closed by the public authorities without its breaking the law."
"This true in Ireland, Denmark, the United Kingdom or any other Member State."
"The owners - that is to say the United Kingdom Government - and the employees of Sellafield have legitimate interests which quite simply cannot be swept under the carpet."
"This applies in this case just as much as to anybody else."
"Finally, just as the recent crisis at Sellafield has been self-inflicted, so the solution to it lies in British Nuclear Fuels' hands, as they themselves understand."
"I wish them well."
"But words are not enough."
"They must be matched by deeds - their deeds."
"From an Irish perspective we are witnessing the beginning of the end of reprocessing at Sellafield and we have allies."
"The powers of the Commission in this area as the responsible Community institution remain hopelessly inadequate, embarrassingly inadequate."
"No uniform standards for safety and discharges, no Community consultation procedure concerning power stations sited near frontiers, no clear Community provisions for the storage and transport of nuclear fuels or nuclear waste, no adequate Community system of information and monitoring in cases of nuclear malfunction."
"Nuclear safety in the enlargement process is a major cause for concern."
"As there are no prescribed criteria in EU law governing the design or operation of nuclear facilities, how do we judge their safety of operation?"
"Realists accept and understand that life is full of risks."
"Society usually accepts a certain level of risk in return for an advantage and proponents of nuclear energy almost inevitably remind us of the balance of risk and benefit."
"What benefit accrues to Ireland for the risk of being exposed to the majority of Britain's nuclear installations?"
"If nuclear safety and nuclear energy are so safe, why are not the majority of these installations located near the population centres of the south-east of England?"
"To minimise the risk to these population centres of course."
"But seen from an Irish perspective, this stands logic on its head, we have counties Antrim, Down, Louth, Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford where the vast majority of the population of the island of Ireland, about 2 million people, live on or adjacent to the Irish sea where the majority of British nuclear institutions are sited."
"Furthermore in recent years, we have all seen how consumer concern about the integrity of the food chain can devastate a once seemingly secure market."
"Witness the BSE and dioxin problem."
"We can only begin to imagine the effect of any kind of nuclear scare - just a scare - on these sectors of our economy."
"Choice about exposure to risk for oneself or for one's children is a very basic human right."
"This right to determine, to control, to have any say about the risk of nearby concentrations of nuclear installations is denied to those of us who inhabit the western shores of the Irish sea."
"In practice, nuclear decision-making in the UK falls far short of democratic standards."
"Often questionable decisions are made behind a wall of secrecy."
"I will conclude."
"The reality of Sellafield goes beyond the contribution to the Kyoto targets on the dependence of the UK economy on nuclear energy."
"It also includes a litany of unreported incidents, falsified quality control checks on MOX fuel rods resulting in the loss of confidence by the Japanese in safety standards at the plant and the cancellation by the Germans and the Swiss of mixed oxide nuclear fuel pellets."
"The reality of Sellafield includes incidents last September and early this year of deliberate sabotage, allegedly by members of the staff."
"Serious doubts are being raised about the long-term viability of reprocessing."
"Their order books are full for a few more years, but no new orders are coming in due to the quality of control lapse at the MOX plant."
"Even the new CEO, Mr Norman Askew, is reported as saying that reprocessing is not the big part of the business it once was."
"A director has publicly stated the future of the plant is in doubt."
"But a nuclear future for Sellafield can be justified: not mixed oxide fuel production, not thermal oxide reprocessing at the MOX and THORP plants."
"The skills and the experience of the workforce and the major capital investment could and should be redirected towards waste management and the creation of a centre of excellence for decommissioning and that is what I suggest we concentrate the debate on."
"Mr President, thank you very much for an interesting and valuable debate."
"I hope that we can all agree on the need for confidence-building because, even though the conclusion is that this incident did not cause substantial damage or serious risks, we see that the price of the loss of confidence is very high."
"It is in the interest of all of us to ensure that our citizens have confidence in our safety and security systems."
"I am ready to come any time to any committee in Parliament to discuss those issues."
"I can say that personally I would very much prefer to have Community rules."
"But we must not give the impression that this would mean higher levels of safety in the European Union, because with the unanimity rule on the decisions on these issues, the end-result could be that we have minimum standard rules which would not live up to the expectations of our citizens."
"We must be realistic, because we know the discussion and the position and attitude among the Member States: they are not willing to give the European Union more competence in this area."
"That is also why the Commission's responsibility in this area is restricted to control radioactivity - but no more than that."
"We need European rules."
"However, we must not give the impression that this will be achieved very easily and quickly."
"I share the view that we ought to discuss it more thoroughly."
"In reply to Mrs Banotti's question, this European Nuclear Installation's safety group brings together the power plant operators and nuclear regulators from both Member States and applicant states."
"It is not a wider forum but they can cooperate in this specific safety group."
"It is not the first time that Sellafield has been discussed and we need to look into the safety issues very closely because, you remember, there was an accident in Japan."
"That was because of lax control and some of the staff thought they could make a mix of their own."
"So even in highly advanced societies there are serious risks with nuclear and processing techniques."
"I should be pleased to come to Parliament at any time to continue this discussion."
"However, I do not want to give anyone false hopes about what can be achieved very quickly and with the help of Member States."
"That is also why we have restricted competence."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to make a comment in relation to yesterday' s Minutes."
"I do not appear amongst the signatories of the attendance register."
"I was present all day yesterday and during the vote which took place at noon, but I do not appear in the Minutes."
"I would be grateful if this error could be corrected."
"We will check the list, Mr Valdivielso de Cué, and make the necessary correction."
"Mr President, I would like to inform the House, under Rule 111, that last Thursday, the offices of the Moss Media Group in Moscow comprising independent television and a number of newspapers and magazines were raided by so-called tax police, uniformed and armed."
"Documents were taken away, the telephones were cut off and threats of legal action remain."
"Mr President, this matter is one of the utmost importance."
"It involves freedom of the press in Russia and further outrages are expected over the next two or three days."
"Mr Robin Cook is in Moscow today."
"He will discuss the matter with Mr Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, and the 15 Ministers are thinking of a joint démarche."
"But we in the European Parliament - what are we doing?"
"Nothing."
"The matter is, if you like, too urgent to take on board because it happened last Thursday and cannot be brought forward as an urgency."
"Could you please refer this question to the Conference of Presidents so that some system can be found to deal with very urgent and important matters such as this one?"
"We take note of your comment and your suggestion, Lord Bethell, and we will pass them on to the President."
"Mr President, I would just like to make the House and the Presidency aware, as I believe it will be of interest to them, that yesterday, on the occasion of the Conference of Reconciliation in Vienna, an agreement was reached between the Austrian government representative, Mr Schaumeyer, and the American Deputy Finance Minister, Stuart Eizenstat, on compensation payments for the victims of Nazi forced labour in Austria."
"The lawyers - and I feel I should take the opportunity to mention this as well - Michael Hausfeld and Martin Mendelson, who represent some of the governments of Eastern European countries, commented at the time that, in some respects, Austria is in fact providing more generous compensation payments than Germany, because in the first place, we are including the agricultural workers, and secondly, we are also paying compensation for children under the age of 12 and women who gave birth whilst in forced labour camps."
"I believe this is worth sharing with the House."
"Thank you for your statement, Mrs Stenzel."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Broad outlines of economic policies"
"The next item is the report (A5-0134/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission recommendation for the 2000 broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community (drawn up pursuant to Article 99(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community)."
". (EL) Mr President, broadly speaking, the report tabled before plenary by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs contains a particularly positive appraisal of the Commission' s recommendation for the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States."
"The committee has worked with its usual efficiency and diligence and has supported its proposals with an impressive econometric analysis which I should like to praise here in public."
"The recommendation for the year 2000 has been formulated at a time of favourable developments and optimistic prospects for the European economy."
"The prospects of an increase in the national wage in Europe in excess of 3% for 2000 and 2001 - 3.4% according to the latest forecasts for 2000 - are much higher than the disappointing actual average rates of increase throughout the 1990s."
"These results, provided that they are realised, offer a window of opportunity, a springboard from which the European economy can launch on to a course which will lead to a permanently high and ecologically sustainable rate of growth."
"It goes without saying that permanently high rates of growth are the sine qua non for improving the employment situation and strengthening the competitiveness of Europe in the global economy."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs accepts that the requisite rate of progress is best expressed through a growth rate of GDP of 3% or more, that this rate cannot be maintained over time without a substantial rise in the potential product of the EU economy and that there can be no increase in the potential product without productive investment. The Commission, however, has avoided specifying the ratio of investment to GDP."
"The Committee on Economic Affairs takes the view that quantitative economic targets may be useful, but insists that the fixing of such targets must not undermine the goals established in the stability pact, which are the fundamental guide for the economic policies in the euro zone."
"Despite this general reservation, the report by the Committee on Economic Affairs expresses the committee' s satisfaction at the restatement in the Commission recommendation of the quantified target, set in the Presidency conclusions of the European Council at Lisbon, of raising labour force participation from 61% to 70% of the population by 2010 and of increasing the participation of women from 51% to over 60% by 2000."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs maintains that the requisite economic growth must be based on price stability and budgetary discipline, reasonable wage increases taking account of price stability, productivity increases and a reduction in unit labour costs, even in the case of reductions in working hours."
"It also believes in greater liberalisation of competition, strengthening national competition authorities, providing special support for associations of small- and medium-sized enterprises and further developing the single market - especially in the public utilities and financial services sectors."
"As far as financial services are concerned, having reached a broad consensus of agreement, we shall be tabling a joint amendment calling for the action plan for financial services to be applied more quickly, i.e. by 2003 rather than 2005."
"The majority of the committee believes that mobilising the market will result in the need to increase investments using purely market instruments."
"At the same time, however, it approves of the restructuring of government spending in favour of investment which must be justified - when it is justified - by the cost-benefit ratio, but rejects using public investments simply to manage the economy."
"On a more general note, the committee approves of the challenges identified by the Extraordinary Council in Lisbon of full employment, a knowledge-based economy, modernisation of social protection systems and dealing with the impact of the ageing population, but expresses its concern at the gap between the key challenges and the often routine specific policy recommendations."
"It therefore calls upon the Commission and Council to seriously consider the need for a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind the general guidelines."
"The committee also reiterates Parliament' s previous call for an interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament on the subject of the adoption of the resolution, although it thanks the Portuguese Presidency for its willingness to cooperate on this matter."
"This is ad hoc cooperation, however, not cooperation reflected in an interinstitutional agreement, and we consider this a shortcoming in our procedure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we achieved a significant degree of consensus in our work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I should like to stress the general acceptance of the feasibility of the objective of achieving full employment within the next decade."
"Of course, there are certain differences in our assessment of the best way of achieving these targets."
"Some of us believe that setting quantitative targets, even without mechanisms for imposing them, would help Europe give concrete expression to its efforts to move in the right direction."
"This comment applies in particular to the target investment rate, which requires us to increase the potential rate of growth of the economy to 3% on a permanent basis."
"This percentage is a familiar figure."
"The Commission set it repeatedly in its studies and it would not have hurt to have included it. We could also have given more categorical expression to the, I believe, general feeling that we need to relaunch the trans-European networks and address the need for new forms of financing for them and the issue of the involvement of private capital and public investment in this sector."
"Without, in any way, giving the green light to squander public spending, we could have tried to give the public sector of the economy a slightly more positive role than merely that of 'guard-dog' for price stability."
"There are margins for all this, especially through the window of opportunity, if the main risk to our economy is from the probability of a crisis on the American money markets which could paralyse the private investment mechanism."
"Just imagine, ladies and gentlemen, if that were to happen and we, in the meantime, had forgotten how to handle public investment."
"The European economy has a huge margin for growth; it is true that the European economy can become more productive, but we need to be bolder in the way we go about it."
"Mr President, when drawing up this draft opinion for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Committee on Social Affairs fully appreciated the importance of this resolution, Parliament' s first resolution on economic policy guidelines since the Lisbon Summit."
"In particular, it stressed the importance of the connection between these two priorities and considered that the common elements of the broad guidelines of economic policy should be fully exploited and the various implementing processes adopted by the Councils over the years coordinated, and by this I am referring to the objectives of the Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne processes."
"In our opinion, the open method of coordination, which was introduced on an experimental basis in Lisbon, should allow for the full exploitation of the connection between growth and employment, which, we feel, cannot be ignored."
"The subsidiarity principle needs to be steered in this direction with regard to the role both of the governments and of the decentralised institutions, without diminishing the decisive part played by greater synergy, greater coordination between the broad guidelines, and by placing greater focus on the European Community dimension with a view to developing an economic policy which can enhance the potential for development in Europe and allow us to effectively achieve the goals which we set ourselves with regard to full employment."
"We have taken the chapters of the broad guidelines into account, in particular the aspects related to the introduction of flexibility and efficiency elements in the products market, the financial services market and the labour market, but we have also acknowledged the importance of the negotiations of the Social Partners and of social objectives."
"A further consideration: we consider - and for the remainder we refer you to the text of the opinion - that Parliament' s role in this matter must be consolidated by formal institution of the procedure laying down a specific interinstitutional agreement on the participation of Parliament in formal consultations on the economic policy guidelines and on the monitoring of their effects."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group will support the Katiforis report on the broad guidelines for economic policies, which we are especially satisfied with since many of our observations were accepted during the debate in committee."
"At a time when we are debating the weakness of the euro, at least in relation to the dollar, I think that we would do well to remember that the state of the European economy is solid and offers a framework for stability and solidity as well as excellent prospects for growth and employment. In short, we can look forward to very positive development over the next few years."
"Therefore, the fact that, in some ways, the US economy is doing better than the European economy, at least in terms of growth forecasts, should not mask the fact that the European economy is doing well at the moment."
"Furthermore, it is the European economy which is funding a good portion of US development."
"However, we should not only be concentrating on the more positive aspects; we should also be taking note of the fragility of continued growth and solidity in the European economy."
"In order to overcome this fragility, in our view, we need the European economy to function better, since it is still subject to excessive corporate rigidity, in both the public and private sectors, and on the part of both economic and social operators."
"We therefore propose greater adaptability and flexibility in the labour market."
"This would clearly involve the removal of the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the European internal market and a deep reform of the tax system, with the adoption of a tax package at European level. To sum up, we should overcome the conservatism which still exists in certain economic and social areas of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you why the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not vote in favour of the Katiforis report as amended by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Obviously, we endorse the general thrust of the Katiforis report."
"In particular, we approve of the ambition to achieve full employment as well as its ambition in terms of sound social and, above all, salary agreements."
"On the other hand, we did not endorse a raft of amendments which we considered to be extremely dangerous."
"We shall reject these amendments. Indeed, we shall reject them systematically, and we hope within the current parliamentary term to convince our fellow Members, including those in the Group of the European People' s Party, how dangerous they are."
"In the first place, we can no longer continue to call for the flexibility of wage contracts to be reformed and increased without specifying our thinking more precisely."
"Endorsing the goal of a European society which is as competitive as possible in terms of know-how means maximising investment in human capital."
"Well, enhanced human capital is not a commodity to be taken and then dispensed with, but rather something to be respected, something that is offered to an individual by allowing them time to be trained, to gain and enhance experience."
"So if there must be structural reform in wages, then it must be in the direction of greater, and not less, stability in employment."
"There is a second fundamental point of which I desperately hope to convince my fellow Members in the next five - now four - years, and that is that we cannot claim to wish to respect the Kyoto Agreement by the year 2008."
"We are aware, and the report acknowledges as much, that, at the moment, it is contradictory to attempt to reconcile an objective of 3% annual growth with the rejection of the urgent requirement to invest in energy saving, transport systems, in improving accommodation, in such a way as to make the Kyoto objectives and the objective of 3% growth compatible."
"- (EL) Mr President, the Commission' s recommendation for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 may well accept a return to full employment, but it has stood by the basic approach of previous years."
"Although I recognise the contribution made by Parliament and our rapporteur in gaining acceptance once again for the concept of full employment, I think that the rapporteur himself, whom I congratulate on his efforts, would agree that we need to redefine what we mean by employment and by full employment."
"What does employed mean when we have before us a policy which dismantles working relations, minimises employment and, as a result, makes general poverty a mass phenomenon."
"As far as its general approach is concerned, the Commission' s recommendation forms part of a more general neo-liberal economic and social policy which, with the support of the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, finds expression in the report under discussion."
"As far as we are concerned, the basic policy objectives should be to support public investment, stable, permanent and full employment, protect and improve the social security system and the system of social protection in general and strengthen active demand by improving the purchasing power of the workers."
"This is the direction the broad guidelines should be taking."
"The amendments which we propose to the European Parliament move in precisely this direction and we call on our fellow members to vote in favour of them."
"Mr President, reading the broad guidelines for the economic policy presented by the Commission for the year 2000 leaves one with a strange impression that something is missing because nowhere is there any mention of the single currency, except in a brief and fleeting reference, stating the importance of the Maastricht criterion regarding the rationalisation of public finances or the need to gear monetary policy towards price stability."
"There is not a word, however, on the current depreciation of the euro and its influence on the economy and economic policies."
"This seems all the more surprising because every few pages the Commission document reiterates the idea that efficiency demands an overall strategy."
"The same is unfortunately true of the European Parliament' s report since, out of the 35 points raised in the resolution, not one relates to the single currency, and it is only briefly referred to in the recitals."
"Apparently, the rule of silence is prevailing, as it did when the major groups within Parliament rejected the proposal from the Union for a Europe of Nations Group to organise, as of today, a debate on the implications of fluctuations in the euro."
"This debate has been deferred once again, even though there is a great deal to be discussed."
"For years, all the economic and financial advantages a strong euro was going to offer have been trotted out for our benefit."
"Now the euro is weak, are we to assume that the loss of these advantages has no implications worth mentioning?"
"This is surely some mistake!"
"The weak euro favours exports, as is often boasted."
"It also, however, presents serious disadvantages which are concealed, such as the misappropriation of capital, third party buyouts of euro zone businesses or weakening of the incentive for structural reforms, even though these are so necessary."
"Finally, the basic problem still remains."
"This depreciation in the euro has occurred because it is perceived as an artificial currency, but until this is clearly stated it will not be possible to remedy the situation."
"In this instance too, then, let us hope that the European Parliament agrees to organise a debate in the near future, before it is too late."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, having scarcely emerged from the dull 80s, Europe has been plunged into the throes of international speculation."
"We were promised a euro-cum-mark that would be stronger than the dollar, and which would compensate for the weakness of economic growth by means of the on-going revaluation of assets."
"We have an ersatz currency whose volatility is enhanced by its non-identifiable character."
"Formerly, speculation on the exchange market involved the pound."
"Now it is the euro."
"This is nothing particularly surprising for us Members of the European Parliament who are accustomed to seeing Europe operating on a daily basis amid differences and antagonisms."
"What will the situation be like after enlargement, when the markets will react to any event affecting any one of the thirty odd countries which make up the European technostructure?"
"It would almost be like the United Nations issuing a currency."
"This reduction in the value of the euro is not something that Mr Duisenberg can do anything about, as this European Central Bank, whatever they say, is the brainchild of the two main States in the euro zone, and the French and German Governments have given the order to do nothing."
"In order to maintain the value of the euro in relation to the dollar, we should have to raise euro interest rates to a level which is slightly higher than that of the dollar, perhaps to a level in the order of 50 base points."
"From my standpoint as a post-Keynesian, I see this as having little impact on economic growth, since this depends on various other factors, the most important of which are psychological."
"Obviously, we cannot agree to all assets located in France being devalued if the downward slide of the euro continues beyond the short term."
"If this should happen, and obviously we hope it does not, then we should have to point the finger at the parties responsible, and this would not mean Mr Duisenberg."
"We shall judge the candidates in the French presidential elections according to the efforts they have made to get us out of this bind."
"Mr President, the report is self-contradictory."
"Paragraph 14 supports the Stability Pact' s demand that price stability should always precede employment-related considerations."
"Elsewhere, the desire is for higher employment and more democratic influence upon economic policy."
"However, inflation should always, of course, be between zero and two per cent."
"This is something that is supported, even though inflation has only stood at that rate for a period of six years in post-war Germany and Denmark."
"It is now quite certain, however, that this state of affairs will always be best for all countries at all times."
"We no longer have any need for elected representatives to devise the right policy mix."
"We have a Central Bank which establishes interest rates on the basis of inflation."
"In this way, the euro is allowed to depreciate and interest rates are increased with the result that there may be lower rates of growth and increased unemployment."
"It is worse than the sacred cows in India, yet the report does not protest against this."
"In paragraph G, on the other hand, a new sacred cow is to be found: that of high taxation."
"Social security arrangements must be critically examined and social expenditure reduced, but savings can also be made on social expenditure by making higher employment the top economic objective."
"In that way, people receiving cash benefits and unemployment benefit will be able to exchange these for proper wages."
"That is an alternative recipe for economic policy, but one which is contrary to the Treaty."
"The balance of trade deficit is normally to be no more than one per cent of GNP, irrespective of whether the money is used for investments, which can subsequently produce much larger deficits again. This would seem to be something which no amount of elections in the Member States or in the EU Parliament can change."
"This is absurd. It runs counter to all experience and is a denial of the principle of democracy which unites our countries and which means that voters can go to the polls and vote in favour of higher employment, even if inflation might, as a result, occasionally rise above the two per cent mark."
"Mr President, I enthusiastically support the further deepening of integration. Many matters are best dealt with at Community level, but when I read the report of my colleague Mr Katiforis - which provides several guidelines which are favourable to the market economy and therefore worthy of support - I cannot agree with some of the proposals in it."
"The dynamism and desired growth of the European economy will not come about by creating Union-wide integrated programmes, whether they be applied with good intentions in the area of training or entrepreneurship or whether they be common support systems for the benefit of SME organisations."
"I also have my personal doubts about the superiority of a European scientific community, if it is to be created from above, i.e. by the volition of the Commission and the Council, and not allowed to develop naturally through networking between the scientific communities, from one business or university to another; financing, both at a national and European level, must naturally be secured."
"Something which I have reservations about is the faith in the importance of top-level structures which stands out in this report; a programme and planning from the top may actually put the brakes on development rather than make it dynamic."
"At present, European dynamism will be improved by dismantling top-level structures, for example, barriers to trade, which are still hindering the creation of a genuine internal market."
"This is what Mr Katiforis is also calling for, albeit of the Commission, when it should be demanded of those nation states, which - in a few individual cases - practice obstructionism, for example, in the areas of transport, public procurement or energy."
"When discussing economic policies in the context of this report, we should not forget about competition policy."
"Recently, the neutrality of the Communities' competition policy has been called into question - justifiably so - inter alia in the case of Volvo-Scania."
"The reason given for regional monopolies and concentration of power in regions with a small population base is rather lame."
"It is clearly a real blow to the industry and trade of small and remote countries while they are making efforts to increase their competitiveness within the Union area."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr Katiforis and Commissioner Solbes, both of whom have displayed a broader than usual understanding of what is necessary for a successful economy."
"We must take advantage of the fact that we are in the European Union to do things collectively."
"I wish to concentrate on research and development."
"I regret that the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy did not draw up an opinion on Mr Katiforis' s report - it should have done."
"Compared to the US and Japan, we are woefully lacking in a proper research strategy in almost all Member States except Finland, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland - countries shown in the Commission paper to have had unusual success."
"We need scientists in order to have research and development."
"Let us stop young people choosing to do other things."
"Let us encourage women."
"Let us ensure that competence in widely-used languages is increased."
"Above all, let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists."
"That is what makes them choose other careers."
"Of course, we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications."
"We need a strategy."
"Jacques Delors spelt it out in his White Paper, so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts."
"However, the big difference between us and the successful economies of the world - the US in particular - is that they spend far more money on investment in science, and it pays off."
"Commissioner Busquin' s communication on the European research area is very good."
"However, what is important is the next stage: transferring that knowledge into goods and products and processes which can be sold."
"Let us be innovative in the European Union."
"Let us start by bringing the innovation unit back from Luxembourg to Brussels, where it can use its skills working with other departments of the Commission."
"That would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do."
"Mr President, as everyone is pointing out, the euro has just lost almost 30% of its value in sixteen months, but the European Commission, like the Central Bank, does not seem to be in much of a hurry to learn the lessons of this experience, as that would be liable to challenge the current monetary policy which benefits only stock exchange transactions and speculation."
"The ambition to achieve full employment and a modern economy, as declared in Lisbon, are indeed laudable objectives, but they are now effectively coming up against the liberal yoke."
"In its document on the broad economic guidelines, the Commission pursues this liberal approach, and these guidelines now represent the reference text for the coordination of economic policy in the Member States."
"The Commission, indeed, shows no compunction in issuing orders to this or that State with a view to drawing up its budget."
"It clearly stresses the target of budgetary streamlining, even going beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact."
"Following the example of the Central Bank, it demands wage moderation as well as structural reform of the labour market, especially in order to make it more flexible."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' report is in line with this approach and with the continuation of the Lisbon decisions."
"It advocates accelerating the liberalisation process as well as the process of applying pressure to wages."
"It proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market."
"This is why I am unable to approve of the guidelines contained in this report, especially when made exacerbated by the many amendments introduced by the right wing."
"The current economic situation, particularly with the decline in the euro, ought to lead the Union and the Member State governments to strive towards the reorientation of European policy, so as to enable it at last to fulfil expectations regarding social issues."
"We must shake up the dogma of the Stability Pact."
"We must reverse the current approach, which makes social policy nothing more than a consequence of economic and monetary policy, responsible only for making good the damage caused by the market by means of a policy of aid."
"This new policy should be particularly based on support to investment that creates jobs by means of a selective policy of credit, the improvement in living and working conditions and a reduction of working hours without flexibility or increased precariousness, taxation on income and financial measures to curb speculation and to release new resources."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the very points which so displeased the previous speaker, i.e. the sections of the reports which display a liberal approach."
"In fact, as recent events concerning the euro illustrate, the European Union and the institutions are currently at a crossroads: we have the choice between the road to prosperity and growth, undertaking radical structural liberalisation reforms that Europe must implement boldly, and the road of preservation and the perpetuation of a corporate, statist vision of the economy which is condemning many European countries to levels of unemployment which are two or three times higher than those in America and to a marginal role in the most innovative and dynamic sectors of the economy."
"Having said that, I cannot fail to welcome the Katiforis and Pomés Ruiz reports, which clearly stress the way in which the liberalisation and flexible nature of the markets - especially the labour market - the dramatic reduction in tax pressure, a thorough reform of state pension systems and the gradual separation of state and economy - first and foremost through the privatisation of public companies - are all choices which cannot now be put off any longer if we want to avoid building a Europe which may well be united, but united by unemployment, marginalisation of the most vulnerable, in particular women and children, and by the endless red tape surrounding the social initiatives of the society, a Europe, that is, which will fail to create either growth or employment."
"This is one of the shortcomings of the euro, a currency which is suffering from a structural crisis and inflexible, excessively regulated markets."
"Some say that political control of the economy at European level would be a way of resolving this crisis."
"Beware!"
"If political control has to be a means of control which transfers the interventionism of national economies to Brussels, this would be a bad move."
"We Italian Radicals are also in favour of political control, but federalist, liberal control, with a limited number of clear laws and no state intervention in the economy, even by the European State."
"Mr President, the present draft resolution by Mr Katiforis contains many valid points."
"We should, however, qualify one key point concerning a matter of principle."
"Both the Commission' s recommendation and the resolution claim high economically sustainable growth as the highest good and pursue this remorselessly."
"This is odd, given the global relations in which the rich West is seen as an exclusive residential neighbourhood."
"Do we want even more?"
"Do we really need so much growth or can we combat unemployment by other means?"
"The lopsided emphasis on material goods is bound to have a detrimental effect on our society."
"It stimulates egocentricity, social exclusion, a blurring of moral standards and moral decay."
"The corruption of society eventually harms economic development."
"On a positive note, attention is paid to the effects of an ageing population on the sustainability of government funds."
"Only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen."
"A further consolidation, a reduction in the debt burden, is desperately needed in many Member States, so as to ensure that funds are available in future for health care and provision for old age."
"Taxes and social security contributions in the European Union are high compared to the United States, but the picture changes fundamentally when we consider the sometimes extortionate insurance premiums which American citizens have to pay."
"The amendments which aim to shift the tax burden from labour to the use of scarce raw materials and minerals receive our support."
"After all, the Kyoto Agreement more than merits compliance."
"Mr President, I want to associate myself this morning with those people who have spoken in this debate and expressed some desire to challenge an atmosphere of complacency about the current state of the European economy."
"I share the view expressed earlier by Mrs McNally that you can look to the United States and see that there has been investment in research."
"That is one of the reasons why the United States is doing better than Europe."
"But we must also emphasise that one of the other reasons why the United States continues to do so much better than Europe is because Europe has not yet properly addressed the issue of structural reform and market liberalisation."
"I refer to the remarks made earlier by Mr Lipietz for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I am very pleased to engage in a debate with him over the next four years on this issue of market liberalisation."
"The fact is that we have not yet seen the agreed market liberalisation within Europe applied in some Member States, not least his own."
"I have a shared concern about the jobs of workers."
"I would be very pleased to bring Mr Lipietz to speak to workers in the United Kingdom who may lose their jobs as a result of decisions made by a French owner of energy companies in the UK, when British companies are not allowed to gain access to the French market because the French have not applied agreed European policy."
"That is a structural reform we must drive through."
"It is not just in that area."
"We see that the wealthiest states within the European Union continue to be the states that apply the strongest amount of state aid."
"That is robbing the jobs of some of the poorer states who are represented here."
"That is also one of the reasons why I do not share the view expressed by Mr von Wogau in relation to competition policy."
"My concern, where decentralisation is concerned, is that there should not be a repatriation of competition policy."
"Mr President, over the past few days, the debate on a European economic government has gained momentum once again in different quarters."
"It is evident that more economic management is required at European level, but it is not so evident that only the 11 euro zone countries or the Ecofin Council will need to take on that coordination."
"At the Lisbon Summit, a decision was made precisely in favour of a wider socio-economic approach in which employment, economic reform and social cohesion are seen as being interrelated."
"In my opinion, the key conclusion that was reached at that summit was that the European Council will itself adopt an active, guiding and coordinating role."
"Each spring, our government leaders will discuss the socio-economic policy on the basis of an integrated progress report from the European Commission."
"Unfortunately, spring had already started this year."
"The text for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 had already been drafted, very much along established lines."
"Why did the Commission not take more time and, in line with Lisbon, draft the guidelines in an interdisciplinary manner, as prepared by the different DGs?"
"Why do we not let the Commission continue with, and further develop, this type of cooperation, which also typified the preparatory work for Lisbon, in a socio-economic field?"
"That seems to me a highly interesting challenge for the Commission' s new Secretary General, David O'Sullivan."
"I would suggest taking into account conclusion 29 of the present report, which advocates a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind economic policy-making to bring it in line with the Lisbon conclusions."
"I would also like to make reference to the conclusions of this Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, compiled by Mr Cocilovo."
"He proposes the drawing up of a single annual report on the economic and social state of the Union, and one set of annual guidelines for sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion."
"One additional suggestion I would like to make is to include the socio-economic forum, which is scheduled for next month, earlier on in the annual cycle, i.e. at the very beginning of the year."
"At the moment, it is just tacked on at the end."
"Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to the consensus-oriented cooperation which we have enjoyed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in this sphere and add that we in this Parliament should break though the compartmentalisation and endeavour to rise above the hobbyhorses of this or the other side and to have an input in, for example, next month' s forum, precisely on that basis."
"The Commission' s recommendation and report may be evaluated in the light of the euro system' s most fundamental problems, and these are undeniably major and glaringly apparent."
"I come from a country whose people enjoy the rare privilege of being consulted in connection with such far-reaching decisions as participation in the euro system."
"Among Danes, there is a great deal of scepticism about, and opposition to, the national currency being swallowed up by the euro."
"I have no doubt that this scepticism and opposition are shared by large and growing groups of the populations of the other Member States, who are not being consulted."
"I only have time to mention a couple of points."
"The first is one which is extremely important to the whole problem surrounding the euro."
"Nobel Prize-winner Franco Modigliani points out that, in his view, unemployment has certainly been used by the European Central Bank as an instrument of economic policy designed to control inflation."
"This is a crucial point."
"The other absolutely crucial point I would mention is directly connected with the subject of the current motion for a resolution: the political weakness of the euro system."
"What is missing, of course, is a political superstructure for steering economic policy."
"This is the background to the French government' s proposal that the EU' s euro system should be equipped with a form of proper economic government."
"It is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the Danish people' s consent."
"I can predict that the question of whether or not the euro zone is to be enlarged to include Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain will be decided in Denmark in the referendum on 28 September."
"The scepticism I have expressed here continues to grow."
"Mr President, the Katiforis report is no more than a mundane vindication of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States."
"Of its 29 paragraphs, 8 go in for approval and then 4 indulge in self-congratulation."
"As far as the working population of the countries of the European Union is concerned, there really is not much to be pleased about."
"What use is the economic growth that the report boasts about, if it is only going to recommend - addressing employees of course - adopting a reasonable attitude in wage negotiations, going so far as to claim that the pension system must be radically revised with a view to protecting their financial position?"
"This is one way of admitting that there is no place in this growth for employed workers or for retired workers."
"Once again, the Council and the Commission are acting as spokespersons for big business, asking Parliament to sanction it."
"For our part, we have not been elected to offer congratulations to governments that come to the assistance of big business and major financial groups in order to enable them to accrue even greater wealth by exacerbating inequalities, leaving 18 million women and men unemployed, making flexibility at work and job instability more widespread, by making swingeing cuts in the total wage bill in order to ensure the continued growth of income from capital, including its most parasitic speculative forms."
"If it is true, as the report states, that we have seen a return to growth, then it is all the more appalling that, throughout Europe, only a tiny minority benefits from it."
"We shall therefore be voting against this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is having to compete with a series of challenges generated by globalisation and the creation of a new economy based on knowledge and new technologies."
"The Union' s strategic goal for the forthcoming decade must be to ensure economic growth and free enterprise, without violating the social question, with guidelines based on competitiveness, sustainable development and the creation of new jobs."
"On the subject of this last point, as the Katiforis report stressed, there has been a slight fall in unemployment in Europe, but unemployment is still unacceptably high, particularly as regards the level of unemployment among women and young people."
"The situation appears worse in certain regions of Southern Europe, in particular in the South of Italy, where 21.9% of the workforce is unemployed, including 56.6% of the 14-25 age group."
"Consequently, in my opinion, broad guidelines for economic growth and a rise in employment should include measures to render the European market more competitive and increase job flexibility."
"In order to bring about sustainable growth, we need to finalise creation of the internal market and remove all the remaining barriers by liberalising those sectors which are not yet totally open to free competition, such as transport, gas, electricity and the postal services."
"We need to introduce the reforms which will have to be implemented by the Member States in order to alleviate the burden on firms, reduce labour costs, sustain actions supporting lifelong learning in the context of a knowledge-based economy and support research to close the gap between Europe and the United States and Japan."
"We need to facilitate public administration structural reform in the countries where excessive red tape is a barrier to private investment and bring the social protection and taxation systems into line with the requirements imposed by the new economic rules and with the constraints established by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Mr President, we do not support the Commission' s guidelines."
"They are outdated and obsoleted by events and do not contain any prospect of a solution to the extremely serious problems which are both holding back economic development and, in particular, weighing down the citizens."
"The proposed formulae will lead to ruin: flexibility at all costs, further dismantling of the Welfare State with pension cuts, the imposition of unjustified salary restrictions across the board, and even discrimination between regions, a decrease in public investment and obsessive recourse to the Stability Pact and the monetarism which have not only already caused irreparable harm in the past but have certainly not done anything to support a euro which is yielding increasingly to the supremacy of the dollar."
"The acclaimed macroeconomic development for job creation is so tied up in the self-regulation of the free market that it has not yet created any jobs, rather it has destroyed stable jobs, while, in the worst of cases, contributing to keeping salaries low in precarious employment sectors."
"This is not the way to fight unemployment, but it will heighten social poverty, increase the democratic deficit and feed public scepticism towards the democratic institutions."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee for their magnificent work, and all the speakers in today' s debate for the additional ideas they have contributed, which will no doubt be useful to the Commission and the debate in the Council of Ministers."
"Today, together with the broad guidelines for economic policies, other issues have been raised, particularly in relation to the euro."
"When speaking of the euro, I would point out two things: firstly, I would ask that the problem be looked at in its entirety, not simply the exchange rate problem."
"Secondly, I would point out that the Commission' s position remains the same; that is to say, clear growth and price stability must logically lead to an improvement in the euro."
"This is not an issue we can go into today, but I wanted to make those points."
"Today, we are discussing in particular the broad guidelines for economic policies."
"The new broad guidelines differ from previous ones in that they partially incorporate Lisbon."
"It has been said that they do not incorporate it fully."
"This is true in the sense that Lisbon is too close to the presentation of the broad guidelines and the bulk of the work had been done previously."
"Nevertheless, I believe that there were elements prior to Lisbon which anticipated or foresaw what was going to happen there and which have been incorporated into the broad guidelines."
"Many of you have referred to the idea of full employment as a fundamental element."
"Full employment, according to the Commission' s initial document - which formed the basis of the Lisbon decision - is something which can be achieved as long as the proposed policies are implemented."
"The problem of full employment is patently one of our primary concerns."
"We can put a figure on both our employment objectives as well as on what we take the expression ""full employment"" to mean, as some of you have suggested."
"It all depends on what we consider the objectives to be."
"It is absolutely essential, in speaking of these objectives, that we know whether they are political objectives or whether they represent the possibility of achieving certain economic results, as a consequence of the policies we implement."
"In any event, I would say to those who are concerned about this issue that the quantitative and qualitative assessment of full employment will become more efficient when we implement the indicators relating to the different policies."
"Some speakers have shown a degree of concern about the Commission' s habitual proposals on the flexibility of the labour market."
"In our view, this flexibility will lead to a better balance in supply and demand in the labour market."
"It will therefore lead to more employment, but also - as we have always argued - greater quality of employment."
"This is something we have regularly stressed."
"The flexibility of the labour market involves many other things: we can talk about regulating working time, but also the removal of all the obstacles which currently stand in the way of employment, such as tax-related issues."
"A major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment."
"The central element of these broad guidelines for economic policies is trying to increase the European Union' s potential for growth."
"If we are not capable of doing so, it is blatantly obvious that the current positive growth forecasts of over 3% will only last a relatively short amount of time and this trend will not be allowed to continue."
"That is why public and private investment are absolutely essential."
"Since 1997, investment has been increasing progressively."
"By 2001, public and private investment should reach 21% of GDP and, in 2004, it should reach 23%, which would bring us very close to that objective of 24%, which was mentioned in the Commission' s White Paper on Growth, Employment and Competitiveness."
"I would like to raise a point here which seems to me to be essential. In my opinion, there is no contradiction between greater investment, greater public investment, and the Stability Pact."
"On the contrary, I believe that since the Stability Pact has allowed for the rationalisation of public finances, it will bring greater public investment in the future."
"I agree with the view that, in these new circumstances, an improvement in the quality of public finances must involve greater public investment. This is a point which the Commission has highlighted in the different stability and convergence programmes and, clearly, it is a point which we must continue to stress."
"Some speakers have also mentioned the importance of research and development and the new economy."
"This is one of the key elements of the broad guidelines, but I would like to remind you - as I always do - that the main point of the introduction of the new economy is to improve productivity, which is the element which is most likely to bring future growth."
"I would like to make an additional comment on two points."
"Firstly, with regard to the interinstitutional agreement, which has been of concern to the Commission, and secondly, the problems of greater coordination in the face of greater subsidiarity."
"With regard to the interinstitutional agreement, this is clearly one of Parliament' s recurrent demands."
"It is also true that its implementation raises legal problems, as well as problems relating to the status of its participants, but I believe that, in any event, we should be satisfied with the progress made this year."
"I promised you some months ago, when we discussed this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that the Commission would try to make the greatest possible progress with regard to its cooperation with Parliament."
"It does not take the form of an interinstitutional agreement, but the presentation of the document on the results of the broad guidelines for economic policies, which will permit a prior debate in Parliament, seems to me to be a positive thing."
"There are other more profound elements, such as the introduction of the idea of broader economic discussions, with the participation of Parliament, and the famous entretiens économiques, which will, in the future, offer us new opportunities and ideas for our political debate."
"In my opinion, the Portuguese Presidency' s idea - which we support - of also establishing a debate with Parliament on these issues, not at an institutional level as suggested by Parliament, but of a different nature, is also clearly positive."
"I believe that this is a good direction to take, and we must continue to cooperate in this regard in the future."
"Lastly, I would like to point out that something has been raised which may seem contradictory between those who argue for greater coordination of economic policies and those who argue for greater subsidiarity in the way these policies are applied."
"As you all know, economic policies are the responsibility of the Member States and, in this respect, subsidiarity is guaranteed."
"In my opinion, the greatest possible coordination is essential."
"I therefore argue that we should move ahead with the coordination of economic policies, making reference to the Member States' obligations."
"I realise that for some of you this may seem like interference by the Commission in the responsibilities of the Member States, but that is what is laid down in the Treaty, in the legislation which we have created for ourselves, and that is the Commission' s mandate: to make specific recommendations."
"I said that coordination is necessary, but I do not believe that this has to be incompatible with subsidiarity."
"Greater coordination and greater definition of global policies does not exclude, however, the existence of an additional margin for action on the part of the Member States."
"I would like to end my intervention by thanking you all for your contributions, your participation in the debate and for your majority support for the document presented."
"Stability and convergence programmes"
"The next item is the report (A5-0108/2000) by Mr Pomés Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual assessment of the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes (2000/2041(INI))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am very happy to reiterate your closing words in the debate on subsidiarity or coordination."
"I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say that there is no contradiction between these two terms, and that they should both be perfectly achievable."
"Perhaps this debate, on the 11 stability plans presented by the countries participating in the euro and the four convergence plans, is a good time to review the harmonisation between the subsidiarity and coordination required by the introduction and future of the single currency."
"This, therefore, is the flip-side of the debate which we have just held on the report by Mr Katiforis, and we must firstly begin to think about the instrument."
"This is the first time that this Parliament has debated the 15 plans presented by the Member States."
"I suspect that, in subsequent versions, the report will not be a single whole, but rather a detailed study will have to be made of the solutions, the weak and strong points, which this Parliament detects in the economic policies proposed by the Member States."
"We are therefore going to ask for more detail in the plans which are submitted, in the structure of expenditure and also of income, paying particular attention to investments."
"We would ask that the projections they make in the medium and long term take account of different scenarios relating to the development of interest rates, demographic development and other variables affecting the stability of our accounts in the long term."
"We also ask in this regard - and I am returning to the debate on subsidiarity - for greater political commitment from the 15 national parliaments."
"We believe that this is a task which falls to everyone, and not just to the European Parliament."
"Some Member States have subjected the stability and convergence plans to internal debate in order to seek political support for this idea of jointly building economic unity, and we should ask the Member States who have not done so to debate these programmes in their parliaments in order to try, firstly, to persuade those states and parliaments to participate in this common task and, secondly, to provide political support for the commitments which are agreed to regarding the necessary coordination of economic policies."
"Turning to the report' s proposals to the House, I am very pleased to note that all of the budgetary objectives established in previous programmes have been met, and even exceeded."
"However, this cause for satisfaction is counter-balanced by the fact that, aside from the possible criticism that the objectives could perhaps have been more demanding and rigorous, we are seeing that the objectives have been achieved, not as a result of the interest and efforts of the Member States, but simply to factors such as the favourable development of interest rates or greater than expected tax revenue."
"We therefore believe that, although budgetary consolidation must continue to be a priority, the economic environment - which has improved a lot - must offer us the possibility of speeding up consolidation and, at the same time, undertaking structural reforms in the medium term."
"It is not acceptable for this relative economic boom to dissuade the Member States from making decisions - sometimes difficult decisions - on structural reforms."
"These include, firstly, labour reform, which we discussed earlier."
"It is clear that not all the states have implemented the labour reforms which we consider appropriate."
"The improved performance of the labour market - which is clear - has been based on satisfactory economic growth, and not all the Member States have made the rigorous reforms that they must make, more radical reforms, to resolve the unacceptable problem of the high rate of unemployment in the European countries in comparison to other countries and which is not only an economic blight but also, and above all, a personal and family blight which cannot be permitted in the modern Europe of the 21st Century."
"It is also crucial that we liberalise the telecommunications and energy markets, and not all countries are doing so in the same way."
"With regard to tax reform, we should welcome the reduction in the high level of taxes in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, and we should bear in mind that the high rate of unemployment often relates to the fact that we have high levels of tax."
"In the long-term reforms, we should also include the serious problem of population."
"In the programmes presented to us, we note that particular attention is given to the ageing of the population."
"Perhaps it is time that we insisted that Member States resolve the demographic problem at source, through a suitable approach to both tax revenue policies and social expenditure, in order to protect families with children."
"This is the way to tackle the problem at source, and not only its effects."
"This is the only way we will prevent the old Europe from becoming a decrepit Europe."
"Mr President, the Liberal Group supports the rigorous and demanding report by Mr Pomés Ruiz."
"It lays out and highlights both the achievements and the shortcomings of the Member States in the way the stability and convergence programmes are applied, which, as I mentioned in my previous intervention on the Katiforis report, have brought satisfactory results for the whole of the European economy."
"However, this current satisfactory situation must not mask a series of shortcomings and must lead to the implementation of the series of recommendations which the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz, correctly makes in his report."
"He mentioned one of these recommendations in his speech: the need to take advantage of the current favourable situation, the healthy state of public finances - which on the other hand are disciplined by the stability and convergence programmes - in order to reduce the deficit, and possibly remove it completely, as well as to reduce debt levels, even to below the limits set in the convergence programmes."
"This would mean that we could make far-reaching tax reforms which would contribute to a more favourable environment for our economy, for business initiative, to freeing up resources and promoting them by fiscal means in an area which is one of our priority commitments: to be up-to-date and competitive at the most advanced levels of the information society and in the application of new technologies."
"I would like to conclude by arguing - and I believe this is one of the conclusions we must draw from Mr Pomés Ruiz' s report - for greater coordination between the Member States with regard to the implementation of these programmes."
"I would therefore like to insist once again on the need for a genuine direction for economic and monetary policy at European Union level."
"- (EL) Ladies and gentlemen, the Pomés Ruiz report has the good fortune to assess the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes at a time when the economic climate has helped these programme achieve success."
"The rapporteur complains that the objectives are more the result of higher than expected tax revenues and the favourable development of interest rates than of the Member States' own efforts."
"This perception betrays a rather narrow-minded budgetary policy."
"In my view, there is nothing reprehensible about being able to achieve balanced budgets through development rather than by imposing fasting and prayer on the Member States."
"To try and balance the budget solely by cutting expenditure, while, at the same time, wanting to reduce taxation, is something which goes beyond economic restructuring and the spirit of the Stability Pact, at least in my understanding, to limiting the involvement of the public sector in the economy."
"It is something in addition to the Stability Pact."
"This trend can also be seen from the reference to the fact that tax and social contributions in Europe account for approximately 46% of GDP, while in the USA and Japan they only account for 30%."
"But they are higher in Europe because we have a social state."
"If Mr Pomés Ruiz' s group wishes to change the policy on the social state, it should table it clearly and not tack it on to the Stability Pact."
"I did not find one single reference in the report which justified Greece' s being singled out, as Mr Karas has done, but I should like to say the following, now that the subject has been raised: it is irresponsible to say that inflation in Greece has only fallen over recent months."
"Inflation has fallen over eight years from 18% to 2%, thanks to constant and unstinting effort."
"I had hoped that we warranted more generous support for this tremendous effort, which has required sacrifices on the part of the Greek people."
"To say that Greece will be unable to sustain the criteria, I am sorry, but that is prejudging the facts."
"How do we know that they cannot be sustained in Greece but they can be sustained in so many other countries of the European Union?"
"The Greek people are determined to apply the criteria and they will show their determination in due course."
"Mr President, we support the main objective of the motion for a resolution under debate, that is, the need for consistently transparent budget regulation on the part of the individual Member States in line with the objectives of the Stability Pact."
"However, we feel that, precisely in consideration of these undertakings and in the light of the current situation, the precise nature of any interventions cannot be identified in advance just for the sake of efficient budget control."
"In fact, in a context where there are varying degrees of interdependence between States, there are too many variables at work to be combined to produce more general indicators."
"I refer to the constant pressure with regard to restricting welfare expenditure, structural reform of the labour market and privatisation of the telecommunications and energy sectors."
"On the other hand, we are aware of the need for a more effective convergence process, for economic cohesion and, therefore, also for the approximation of the single currency, whose oscillation is no longer virtual but is in line with prices and taxes; the need, of course, for more harmonious tax and fiscal policies, but also pricing policies; for more harmonious investment policies as regards both research and the closing of infrastructure gaps, including within the individual States, but also for greater homogeneity in the action of public administrations."
"The most representative variable is certainly the time frames and contents of the Treaty reforms and the process of constitutionalisation of the Union, i.e. of a greater or lesser European political presence."
"Mr President, I understand that it is not always easy, in a debate such as this, to differentiate between those aspects of our policy which we normally raise in the broad guidelines for economic policies, the stability and growth pacts or the references to the convergence reports, which will be the subject of the third debate this morning."
"In the debate we have just held we rather confused the three elements."
"I would essentially like to refer to the one which seems essential today, that of the stability pacts, although I will mention certain other points which have been raised."
"Firstly, I share Mr Pomés' s view that we need greater coordination, which is not incompatible with subsidiarity, but I am also interested in his additional demands that we work in more detail on expenditure and income, the existence of different scenarios or greater commitments in terms of national policies."
"However, I would like to remind him that, within the framework of subsidiarity, it falls to the Member States to define their own stability and growth programmes."
"The Commission must judge them, but it is not our job to give instructions on this point."
"Nor is it our job to give instructions on the stability programmes or structural reforms, which you have mentioned."
"These structural reforms in fact fall within the broad guidelines for economic policies."
"However, there is a point - the third which you referred to - which lies between the world of structural reform and the tax obligations relating to the deficit and, above all, the stability of public finances, in particular with regard to debt."
"I am referring to the demographic problem and specifically the ageing of the population."
"It is true that this is much more than a purely financial problem, but this is the concern which we highlighted in Lisbon."
"I would say that, in this case - as in the case referred to by Mrs Randzio-Plath, of the need to compare the quality of programmes and greater harmonisation, or the reference by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, for example, to deepening tax reforms - in our current thinking there is the reasonable prospect of fulfilling the objectives of the stability and growth programmes, and we believe that we must pay more attention to what we call the sustainability and quality of public finances."
"We will present a report in May on this specific point, in which we intend to consider not only the nature of income but also the nature of expenditure as well as how the reduction in public deficit has been achieved and what instruments have been used."
"These are instruments of a permanent nature which have the same characteristics in each of the Member States."
"We will also tackle the issue of our future obligations."
"In many cases the Member States have obligations which are not classed as debt, but which do, in fact, constitute debt in one form or another."
"All of this will allow us to hold the debate which you have mentioned."
"I believe that that will be the time to carry out this type of comparison in more depth."
"Having said this, I am grateful for the effort you have made to assess the work we have done."
"I believe that the problems of stability and convergence are basically characterised - as you have correctly highlighted, Mr Pomés - by the fact that, firstly, the objectives set have been met; secondly, because we are following the same line."
"However, that fulfilment of the objective, especially with regard to the reduction of public deficits, has been less ambitious - surely as a result of an improved economic situation - and we must take advantage of that improved economic situation so that we do not move backwards, but that we make progress in the right direction."
"I said that I wanted to make a couple of additional comments on two points that have been raised concerning issues which are not strictly related to this report, but with the previous report."
"Mr Karas referred to the Greek problem and the problems of sustainability with regard to convergence criteria."
"In the case of Greece, exactly the same criteria were applied as in previous assessments."
"I understand that concern, mentioned in the Commission' s report, about the sustainability of inflation, but I would also like to provide some information which may clarify the situation."
"According to the latest figures of the harmonised CPI - published on 15 May and concerning the month of April - Greek inflation is improving considerably in comparison to the previous situation: it has decreased from 2.8% to 2.1%; and the unharmonised index also shows better figures for April as compared with March."
"Therefore, I believe that these concerns about Greek inflation are sometimes excessive."
"Secondly, you will have to debate the problems relating to the amendments which you wish to raise in the Pomés report."
"I will simply say, with regard to two amendments by your Group, that in one of them there is a small error relating to Greece' s entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. In my view, in Amendment No 4, it would make more sense to adopt a more positive approach with regard to the Greek government' s future obligations than it would to adopt an approach which raises doubts as to its capacity to fulfil its obligations."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Adoption of single currency by Greece"
"The next item is the report (A5-0135/2000) by Mr Goebbels, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision for the adoption by Greece of the single currency on 1 January 2001 (COM(2000)274 - C5-0226/2000 - 2000/0110(CNS))."
"Mr President, Greece will be the twelfth country to sign up to the euro."
"Greece does not have to beg to be allowed into the euro zone; it is fully qualified to join the States that will introduce the euro as an effective and definitive means of payment in 2002."
"In Greece, the economic convergence criteria have been met, as a result of a stabilisation policy implemented most consistently by the Greek authorities since 1996."
"At the beginning of the 1990s, Greece was considered the sick man of Europe, economically speaking."
"The rate of inflation exceeded 20%."
"The European Union officially described the budgetary deficit as excessive."
"The public sector was notoriously mismanaged."
"Almost half of the public debt was due to on-going transfers from the state to public undertakings."
"Today, major international bodies such as the IMF, the OECD, the Commission and even the ECB generally speak very highly of the efforts which the Greeks have made."
"It must be noted that private operators have also discovered Greece."
"In recent years, it has become a significant net recipient of foreign capital."
"The stock exchange has undergone rapid expansion. International rating agencies have improved their rating for Greek loans."
"The situation is far from perfect, of course."
"There are still problems, particularly regarding the restructuring of the public sector."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stresses the following points. Greece must continue to make efforts in order to ensure that the progress achieved in terms of disinflation has a lasting effect."
"The government must step up the anti-inflationist bias of the economic policy instruments available to it, particularly in the fields of the budget and income policy."
"Cooperation between the two sides of industry seems essential in order to maintain a situation of non-inflationary growth."
"Even if considerable progress has been achieved in terms of the implementation of structural reforms, Greece must step up progress in the reforms which are still necessary, including the effective transposition of European legislation into national law."
"Parliament has been consulted, in the context of a political decision to be taken by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, after deliberation by the forthcoming European Council."
"Parliament' s response can therefore only be a political one, in favour or against, like any final decision in a genuine democracy."
"Greece' s entry into the euro zone does not entail any political risks."
"Greece is entitled and, indeed, obliged to join EMU."
"There are probably some economic risks but these are more significant for Greece than for the countries in the euro zone."
"In joining the euro zone, Greece will be forced to maintain the culture of stability which has been established since 1996, and this involves pursuing a responsible economic policy."
"This has, however, already created a virtuous circle leading to sustainable, non-inflationist growth, proving that stability is not an end in itself but that it must serve the purpose of healthy growth."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by an overwhelming majority, therefore urges Parliament to vote in favour of Greece' s accession to the euro zone in 2001."
"Mr President, let me add a few more personal observations."
"I should like to congratulate the Danish and Swedish governments on having decided to consult their citizens regarding accession to the single currency."
"I hope that the results of these plebiscites will be favourable. In the same way, I should like to see the United Kingdom opt for the single currency in the very near future."
"The shared objective of the fifteen Member States to create a European Union which is ever more closely bound, particularly comprising an area without internal borders, could not be achieved in full without a single currency."
"The United Kingdom, as one of the financial capitals of the world, will not be able to claim all the advantages of an ever more integrated European financial market unless it becomes part of it in its own right and takes on all the joint responsibilities and obligations required under Economic and Monetary Union."
"There are some Members of Parliament who will vote against my report tomorrow, or who will abstain."
"Some are opposed to the euro, as is their right, while others are attempting to make political capital out of the real concerns which our fellow citizens have regarding the dollar-euro exchange rate."
"It must be stressed that the euro is a stable currency."
"Citizens' purchasing power within the euro zone has remained virtually unchanged since inflation has been, and remains, at a very moderate level."
"Of course, the value of the euro has fallen in relation to the dollar and, to a lesser extent, in relation to the yen and the pound."
"Such fluctuations are inevitable in a floating exchange rate system. Even so, the euro has not become a weak currency."
"In the last twenty years, the Deutschmark has experienced much more extreme variations in relation to the dollar."
"In 1985, the dollar stood at 3.5 DM."
"In order to reach such a low level in relation to the dollar, the rate of the euro would have to fall below 0.6 to the dollar."
"Some people claim that the financial markets do not value the euro because of Europe' s tardiness in implementing structural reforms."
"What structural reforms did Germany undertake after 1985 in order to ensure that the Deutschmark returned to a rate of 1.7 or 1.8 DM to the dollar?"
"The fact is, the economic position of the European Union is very sound, and is much more favourable than it has been over the last decade."
"The only grey area is a rate of unemployment which, although falling, is still excessive."
"A return to full employment is certainly not calculated to please the financial markets most of all."
"Generally speaking, good news regarding employment makes the stock exchange nervous, as it makes them afraid of a rise in inflation."
"Financial markets operate according to their own particular logic."
"They look for immediate returns, and currently this is a safer bet in the United States, particularly because of its higher interest rates."
"This trend looks set to continue, as the Federal Reserve has just hiked up its interest rates."
"With their sheep-like behaviour, however, the markets will ultimately come to realise, Mr President, that, in the medium term, the euro will be a more secure currency than the dollar."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to welcome Greece into the euro and say that we shall certainly be voting in favour of Greek membership."
"For those other 'out' countries, including my own, I very much hope that they will be able to join the euro soon."
"I very much regret too that there are so few British Conservatives here in the Chamber today because it shows, with Greece now the twelfth member of the euro zone, how far from reality British euroscepticism about the future of the currency is."
"The euro has successfully delivered low inflation, rising growth, falling unemployment and protection for the euro zone economies from the ups and downs of the foreign exchanges."
"Indeed, the British perception of the euro as a failure, because of its fall against the dollar, simply misunderstands the whole project."
"The key test of a currency is price stability within the economy, not the value of the currency against other currencies outside the economy."
"On the test of internal stability, with inflation at less that 2% and growth higher at 3.1% in the euro zone than in Britain, the euro is clearly succeeding."
"Indeed, research at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi recently calculated the euro' s value as if it had existed over the last few decades, weighting each predecessor currency's value to create a synthetic euro."
"Historically, that research found that the euro actually swooped between a high of USD 1.70 in December 1979 and a low of just USD 0.69 in February 1985."
"In other words, the euro could stay within its historic trading range and happily now either fall by a further 23% or rise by 188%."
"Certainly that synthetic euro included currencies such as the Italian Lira, but the same point applies even to the mighty German Mark on its own."
"If the euro is a weak currency, than the Mark was positively anaemic."
"It plunged to DEM 3.45 against the dollar at the end of February 1985, which is a third below its current rate of DEM 2.16 to the dollar."
"Within three years, and a dollar crash, the Mark was back to DEM 1.57 during December 1987."
"The truth is that the history of foreign exchange is a history of gross misalignments, of overvaluations and undervaluations, each inflicting either depressive pain or inflationary costs on the economy and, as Greece has rightly recognised, the euro is a way of regaining control over a key part of our economic environment."
"- (EL) Mr President, the report under discussion contains accurate information and an objective assessment."
"Greece is being judged, just as the first countries in EMU were judged, and this judgement accords Greece the position which it deserves, the position which it could have taken up back then, when it could have become a member of EMU along with everyone else, but which it failed to take up because of the weakness of its government."
"In all events, this moment is an historic moment for Greece and, may I say, for Europe too."
"I hope that we shall see other such historic moments when other countries join and, even more so, when we proceed, as we must, with the policy to complete unification."
"The euro restored politics to Europe and it is incumbent upon us to pave the way so that politics in Europe can be institutionalised and globalisation, which is progressing blindly, without any historical or political plan, can be politicised at a later date, through a unified Europe,"
"For Greece and the other members of EMU, the problem of sustainability is crucial."
"The problem of whether or not they will be able to act together on economic policy, as if they had already achieved political unification, is a political problem par excellence."
"It is a problem of development choices and changes and, of course, it is a problem of public finance management."
"Greece has a tax reform problem."
"A large part of the economy pays no taxes and the basic taxes which exist in other Member States do not exist in Greece."
"The average Greek taxpayer pays more than other Europeans but total tax revenues in Greece are much lower as a percentage of GDP."
"This structural change is pending, while our government is confining itself mainly to privatisation."
"Other important structural changes are also pending, such as the need to strengthen regional authorities and their financial independence, reorganise cooperatives in all sectors from the bottom up and liberalise and strengthen the social economy and the third sector."
"These are the areas which need to be strengthened immediately if sustainability is to have a future."
"Mr President, the European Parliament report on Greece' s adoption of the single currency on 1 January 2001 is remarkable, more by virtue of the political will it expresses to enlarge the euro zone than by its concern for technical exactitude."
"It is, however, true that Greece has made considerable efforts in order to meet the Maastricht criteria and has achieved good progress, except in a few areas, such as public debt, but on that subject there are some countries within the euro zone that are doing no better."
"These minor failings, which would have had little impact if the euro had been strong, are now liable, against the background of the euro' s depreciation, where the slightest ambiguity serves to detract from the image of the single currency, to have a much more negative effect, for psychological reasons."
"Nonetheless, the European institutions did not feel that they should postpone Greece' s accession so as not to give the impression that they had anything to fear and, from that point of view, the position seems perfectly logical, albeit somewhat risky."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group almost agrees with their conclusions, but as a result of a very different logical argument."
"Our initial impulse, obviously, would be to refrain from participating in a debate which a good number of us think is nothing to do with us."
"But, on the other hand, we think that extending the euro zone may, in the end, provide the stimulus for beneficial reforms."
"The fact is, the more the euro zone is extended, the harder it will be for the single currency to represent nations which are very different, and the more it will be recognised that it would be much simpler to make the system more flexible by having the euro develop into simply a common currency, overlapping with the national currencies with a degree of flexibility but not replacing them."
"This solution, of progress towards a shared currency, would probably attract the support of the countries within the European Union which, until now, have remained outside the euro zone, creating a shared point of reference for everyone, and putting an end to the current schism, which is disastrous for the credibility of Europe as a whole."
"- (EL) Mr President, the Council' s legislative proposal on the adoption by Greece of the single currency on 1 January 2001 is a positive proposal which responds to the objectives of the European Union to strengthen social and economic cohesion through Economic and Monetary Union."
"The New Democracy team within the European People' s Party has always vigorously supported the policies needed so that Greece, which was outside the first round of Member States, could honour the obligations needed in order to join the euro zone."
"The truth is that Greece now meets the convergence criteria, with the exception of the public debt criterion."
"However, this also applied in the case of Italy and Belgium and Greece should not suffer adverse discrimination in the present case."
"In fact, economic development and convergence policies started in Greece at the beginning of the 1990s, as both the Commissioner and the representative of the European Central Bank stressed during the meeting of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and they concern various governments and various political powers."
"However, they are due mainly to the efforts of the Greek people as a whole."
"Policies in Greece need to focus today on further structural changes, while maintaining an anti-inflationary line, with the aim of achieving a real social market economy in conditions of healthy competition, so that Greece can keep comfortably to the Dublin Stability and Development Pact."
"EMU will be a real success once it succeeds in uniting all the Member States, far more Member States such as Sweden, where convergence is proceeding exceptionally well."
"I hope that soon the verdict of the Swedish people will take the completion of the euro zone one step further."
"For the time being, we call on the European Parliament to vote in favour of Greece' s accession to the euro zone and we assure you that, as far as we, the main opposition are concerned, we shall use our policies to support the efforts being made to apply the rules of the Stability Pact and to honour joint European obligations within the framework of a unified country without borders."
"Mr President, Greece meets the convergence criteria according to the European Commission' s verdict, which is based on a very nominalistic interpretation."
"Every self-respecting economist knows that Greece, despite the impressive achievements of the past couple of years, does not yet have inflation and government debt sufficiently under control or in order."
"The Greek government has major financial interests in an extensive number of government enterprises which are mostly loss making."
"In 2001, the derogation for the liberalisation of various sectors will lapse, at which point the large hidden government debt - half the size of the current one - will become public."
"Why did the Commission not take these skeletons in the cupboard into consideration during the assessment?"
"On 17 January last, the Greek drachma was revalued by 2.5%, mainly to push down inflationary trends."
"At the moment, the short-term interest rate in Greece is about 600 basic points above the European Central Bank' s level."
"Participation from 1 January 2001 means that the short-term interest rate must come down by the end of this year at the latest."
"As a result, the credit facility will expand considerably and Greece will be unable to meet the inflation criterion."
"Why does the Commission turn a blind eye to this?"
"In the interests of the Greek citizens and a more flexible development of the Greek economy, we are forced to decline our support for this Commission proposal."
"- (EL) Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his serious and objective approach to Greece' s candidacy."
"I wish to thank him because he dealt with us just as strictly as all the Member States which preceded us in forming the single currency."
"This is the biggest compliment which he could give a country which, for a while, gave the impression that its economy was on the slippery slope towards general disintegration."
"The world has many examples of where such a slippery slope can lead; however, there are relatively few examples of a country which has found the strength not only to stop but to reverse the decline and manage to satisfy the extremely stringent stability criteria of today' s world."
"This success is particularly significant because it was built on the basis of an economy which was not rich and not particularly strong."
"We do not need you to remind us that the Greek economy is weak."
"We know it is."
"For a nation to build monetary stability on such a basis requires greater effort and sacrifice than in a richer economy."
"The fact that the Greek people agreed to make these sacrifices is proof positive of their determination to break away once and for all, by their own efforts and taking advantage, of course, of the support of the European Union, from the fate of economic backwardness."
"And we shall make the same effort in the future, not because you are strict and we have to, but because it is in our interests to do so."
"This effort is dictated by our wish to have a better standard of living, to run a modern economy and to prosper with the rest of Europe."
"We are here not because we wanted to conceal our weaknesses, but because we wanted to fight and we fought and we won."
"As far as we are concerned, we are a small country, but we are fighters and our accession to the single currency is a vote of confidence in this huge European venture; it is a sign of the fact that we support the European endeavour and we hope that other, far richer countries will see this and follow our example."
"No one should rejoice prematurely at the present vicissitudes of the single currency."
"In joining, we have shown our trust in Europe, in monetary union, in the prospect of economic unification and in the success of our common economic fate."
"That is the meaning of Greece' s accession, that is the meaning of its acceptance."
"Europe has become stronger today, not weaker, as the result of Greece' s accession."
"Mr President, the Commission' s and the ECB' s convergence report deals not only with the Greek, but also with the Swedish, convergence programme."
"So too does Mr Goebbels' report, even if the part about Sweden is limited."
"The Swedish economy is doing well - very well."
"Mr Goebbels also points this out."
"In common with Mr Karas and Mrs Randzio-Plath, he also issues a reminder that the EU would be that much stronger if all the Member States were to participate in EMU."
"This is a timely reminder of something which is self-evidently the case."
"If one is going to join the EU, one should not do so by halves."
"Even if the economies of Great Britain, Denmark and Sweden are going well, it must be clearly pointed out, as it was by Commissioner Solbes Mira in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that, if the spirit of the Treaty is to be complied with, no Member State can, in the long term, place itself outside so strategic an area of cooperation as the common currency."
"This could have been brought out more clearly in the report."
"The euro has provided greater stability. This has benefited companies, especially small companies."
"Price competition has increased, and there has been greater transparency."
"The euro is not weak. Instead, it is the dollar which is extremely strong."
"Allow me to remind those countries outside the euro zone that there is a danger of their influence declining further."
"Last week, we learned that France' s prime minister wants to see a Euro 11 - soon a Euro 12 - with more influence and power when it comes to economic and financial policy."
"At present, the economy is on the way up in Europe, but the clouds are gathering - in the United States and in Europe."
"You do not buy an umbrella once it has begun to rain."
"Instead, you buy an umbrella when the sun is shining so that you are prepared for when the rain comes."
"The euro provides Europe with economic stability and competitiveness."
"There are very strong economic and moral reasons why Sweden should join EMU."
"Sweden should also have an obligation to help increase Europe' s economic competitiveness."
"I should therefore have liked to have seen my home country, Sweden, being able to join with Greece today."
"- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our reservations about Greece' s accession to EMU are not a matter of principle; they are based on actual facts, as regards both EMU in general and the Greek economy."
"As far as EMU in general is concerned, we are in favour of real economic and monetary union."
"Unfortunately, this union is only monetary, not economic."
"It is MU, not EMU."
"We know that EMU was created prematurely for political reasons which date back to the events of 1989 and 1990, which is why the child, the euro, has been delivered early and is languishing in an incubator."
"This is the opinion expressed by the Nobel prize-winning economists Friedman, Tobin and Modigliani."
"The creation of EMU was not preceded by an agreement on the economic policy which the Member States had to follow."
"Only now are the Commission and Council trying to outline common policies for certain economic problems such as unemployment and competitiveness."
"But the road is long and full of adventures, as the poet says."
"The Goebbels report tells us that Parliament' s reply cannot but be a political one and assures us that Greece' s accession to the euro zone does not involve any political risk."
"However, the report adds that there are economic risks and that they are greater in the case of Greece than in the case of other countries belonging to the euro zone."
"We agree."
"There is no danger to the economies of the other 14 Member States."
"Of course, I have trouble understanding how anyone can distinguish so easily between political and economic risks, but we shall let that pass."
"As far as Greece is concerned, our reservations concern the economic risks mentioned in the report."
"The sole aim of the economic policy pursued by Greece over recent years has been to satisfy the convergence criteria."
"Efforts have focused on improving indicators, not real economic quantities."
"The competitiveness of the economy has not improved and unemployment continues to rise."
"The structural changes needed have not been carried out and privatisation has been presented as the new panacea for development and prosperity."
"Wage differentials have been sacrificed to indicators and are increasing, and, as a result, the figures are doing well while the people are suffering, however."
"In all honesty, the Goebbels report says that, as regards convergence, all EU governments are required to produce results but are free to choose the means of achieving it."
"It is therefore the Greek government' s choice of means which we object to."
"The means chosen were neither economically suitable nor socially just."
"The rich got richer and the poor got poorer."
"In joining EMU, we are jumping in at the deep end and hoping for the best."
"Mr President, firstly my congratulations to Mr Goebbels on a very professional report and an excellent presentation."
"Some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress."
"Securing budgetary discipline strengthens price stability and creates conditions which are conducive to creating much needed employment within the territories of the Union."
"The Stability and Growth Pact States provide the 15 Member States of the Union with a comprehensive surveillance procedure to monitor their budgetary policies."
"The Stability and Growth Pact calls for Member States to reach, in the medium term, a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus."
"It must also identify the adjustment pacts adopted to reduce the general government debt ratios."
"The Commission and Parliament monitor submissions made by each Member State of the Union to ensure compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact."
"We must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the Member States of the Union."
"The principle of the Stability and Growth Pact is also a logical progression from the criteria laid down in Maastricht for the Member States to comply with economic conditions for participation within the new European single currency."
"The one comment I would like to make about the state of the single European currency is: Why do so many Member States want to join such a regime?"
"It is clear that Greece will shortly join the existing 11 Member States who are participating in the economic and monetary union, and I wish to congratulate Greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future."
"I welcome Greece into the euro zone."
"It is also clear that Sweden and Denmark will accede to the single European currency regime over the next couple of years."
"It is known that the vast majority of countries from eastern and central Europe want to sign up to the process of economic and monetary union in as short a time as possible, but I believe that the European Central Bank has to outline a clear strategy as to how it intends to bolster the value of the new euro."
"The 290 million citizens within the existing 11 EMU countries have the right to know what the European Central Bank intends to do to maintain and enhance the value of the euro now and into the future."
"We shall adjourn the debate on Mr Goebbels' s report, which will resume at 3 p.m. today, as we are now going to start the voting, which will run from 11.30 a.m. to noon."
"It will be adjourned for a formal sitting and will resume immediately after the formal sitting."
"I therefore urge the Members not to leave the Chamber at the end of the formal sitting."
"Agenda"
"As regards the report by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal for a Council framework decision on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, currently scheduled for Thursday 18 May, the rapporteur, Mr Gerhard Schmid, has just noted that the text which is to be submitted to the Council on 29 May is substantially different from the text submitted to Parliament, on which the report in question was based."
"This means that Parliament must be consulted afresh. In order to avoid debating the subject twice over, the rapporteur wishes to wait until the Council' s recommendation has been updated in order to draw up a new text."
"The Socialist Group has therefore asked that this matter be referred to committee and that the item be removed from the agenda for next Thursday."
"(Parliament gave its assent) I must inform you that due to the late submission of the report by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, this report was not available in French, Spanish or Swedish for the meetings of the political groups last night."
"I therefore propose that we keep the debate on the report on the agenda as it currently stands, as the first item on Thursday 18 May, but that we defer the vote on the report until the next part-session."
"Are there any objections?"
"Madam President, it would be much more coherent and in keeping with our Rules of Procedure if we voted, as long as we hold the debate, on Thursday evening or Friday morning."
"Mr Barón Crespo, the problem is that the text is still not available in French, Spanish and Swedish, thus presenting a problem in terms of our Rules of Procedure."
"That is why the Bureau proposed this solution."
"Madam President, I respect what the Presidency has said, but I have different information: that this morning all the versions are available."
"I accept the President' s words, but I must point out that there is some inconsistency here."
"Mr Barón Crespo, I quite understand your objection."
"I am informed by our services that the other reason for making this proposal was related to the limited time the groups have to table amendments."
"Having said that, following your request, I suggest that we put to the House the sense of the proposal which I have just made."
"Perhaps Mrs Buitenweg can give us her opinion, as rapporteur?"
"Madam President, I would very much regret it if my report were to be taken off the agenda and if the vote were not to take place this week."
"We have an agreement with all political groups in this Parliament that we would accelerate proceedings for this directive."
"This is necessary to put through this directive swiftly and within the time in which the Portuguese Presidency, which has shown exceptional commitment in this respect, is in office."
"The Council will be convening before our next plenary sitting."
"This means that if we do not adopt a resolution here, the Council will be unable to adopt its position either, and everything will be shelved long term."
"I would like to point out that the group which has the most problems and seizes upon administrative issues as an excuse to postpone dealing with these, is also the group which voted against this report in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"I therefore do not rule out other motives which might be at play here."
"This has a bearing on the speed at which anti-discrimination can be translated into legislation in Europe and at which people can therefore be protected from racial or ethnic discrimination, and I do not appreciate the fact that Parliament is arguing in favour of postponing this protection."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the importance of this discussion, but I propose entering the debate on the agenda for tomorrow, as the Bureau wished."
"I suggest that the Conference of Presidents or, at any event, the groups, should come to some agreement on the procedure to be adopted regarding voting after the debate, and that our final decision on the timing of the vote should be postponed until tomorrow."
"May I take it that the various group presidents and Members of Parliament agree in principle, as I am afraid that if I give the floor to every Member who requests it we shall be starting the whole debate up again?"
"Mr President, as you know, I am the co-rapporteur with Mrs Buitenweg on this important directive on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I hope that you will rule that the vote, as per our agenda agreed on Monday, will go ahead and I have two points to make to our colleagues in the PPE in that respect."
"The first is this: since this directive was first proposed, the whole furore across the European Union because of events in Austria and elsewhere, where the extreme right has come forward, has caused us, as a Parliament, with the widest possible across-party support, to work with the Council and the Commission to agree an accelerated timetable to enable this directive to go through to provide the strongest possible response to the racist and extremist threats that undermine our combined values."
"That deal with the Council and with the Portuguese Presidency said that we would agree in this Parliament this week prior to the Council of Ministers' meeting in June."
"If we fail to meet that commitment, what does that say to the racists?"
"And my second point: we talk about the dignity of Parliament."
"What about the dignity of black and ethnic minority people subject to racial harassment, victimisation and discrimination?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make things quite clear."
"The debate is indeed going to take place as scheduled on the agenda and, like everyone in the House, I appreciate its importance."
"Nonetheless, I suggest that you accept my proposal, which is this: that the debate should take place as scheduled on the agenda and, tomorrow, the sovereign Assembly, after consulting the groups, shall decide whether or not to vote on this report during the present part-session."
"I think it would not be right to vote on it immediately."
"Madam President, I do not see why the Conference of Presidents should make the decision."
"Surely it is up to all of us here at the plenary sitting to decide whether or not the vote should take place during this part-session, not the Conference of Presidents?"
"We wish to decide right here, either today or tomorrow, whether the vote on this directive and this report should take place this week."
"We do not wish to leave the decision to the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, I think you have not been listening to my suggestions carefully enough."
"I did not suggest that the decision was referred to the Conference of Presidents, which does not have the authority to decide."
"I suggested reconciling points of view within the groups and then tomorrow, in the House, discussing the timeliness of voting this week."
"It goes without saying that only the plenary assembly has the right to make this decision."
"I should now like to put an end to any further speeches on the subject, as I am afraid that discussing the matter ad infinitum is not going to lead to a clear decision."
"I shall just give the floor to Mrs Ludford, whose group has not yet had an opportunity to comment."
"Madam President, I just wish to emphasise on behalf of the Liberal Group the desirability of debating and voting this report this week."
"Despite the short timetable for the consideration of this matter, it has been dealt with very fully in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and there has been every opportunity for amendments to be tabled."
"It is regrettable that there have been administrative delays in producing all the language versions."
"However, I feel that there is a touch of opportunism in the PPE Group' s objections to a vote this week."
"After all, if it were technically impossible, the services would never have proposed that it be voted on tomorrow."
"Therefore, we should debate and vote on it tomorrow; otherwise there is a danger of obstruction by one group."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I put it to you that we decide as follows: we shall carry on the debate as scheduled on the agenda and tomorrow, the House will consider whether the vote should be retained as scheduled, after consultation with the various groups."
"Vote"
"Mrs Muscardini, I suppose you wanted to speak on the next item, but, quite frankly, I would urge you not to take the floor."
"I cannot deprive you of your freedom of speech, however, but I do appeal to your sense of responsibility."
"Madam President, my responsibility is that I have worked in this Parliament for 11 years and I have seen it deteriorate with every passing day."
"I will not go back to the previous debate although I had requested the floor in order to speak on the previous matter."
"I am afraid that this is not the first time that the Presidency has ignored this area of the Chamber and so I am going to speak on the House' s agenda."
"Would the Presidency please organise the Secretariat and herself in such a way as to accord all Members the same right to speak on the matters over which they wish to take the floor."
"It is deplorable to talk of democracy and human rights and then not give Members the right to read the texts in their own language or to speak in the Chamber."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- González Álvarez report (A5-0128/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the González Álvarez measure on the regulation on the monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars."
"Why am I in favour of this measure?"
"It goes without saying that I support the monitoring of new passenger cars when they are first placed on the market, but my vote in favour of the motion also contains a call to make greater efforts in the monitoring of second-hand cars, for, in actual fact, I would argue that new cars are never to be found on the road due to the fact that the very act of driving them along a road ages them by definition."
"It is, above all, 'old' cars, the cars which have been in use for a number of years, which cause atmospheric pollution."
"I call for monitoring of these 'old' cars, to ensure that they are always in a state of good health and to prevent them from harming the earth' s atmosphere."
"I therefore support the use and preservation of pensioner cars as well."
"- (FR) The González Álvarez report deals with reducing CO2 emissions, a necessary goal, particularly with the fight against global warming at stake."
"An objective like this would require Europe to provide itself with effective resources in order to limit such emissions, either by binding standards, as is the case for other pollutants, or by incentives, with checks and penalties."
"Furthermore, the increase in the number of vehicles plays a major part in the increase in CO2 emissions."
"This aspect of the problem must be tackled as well, by implementing a transport development policy involving rail and waterway transport, combined transport, and public service which is capable of offering an effective alternative to the private car."
"According to the explanatory statement, the Commission is still at the stage of a 'monitoring scheme' , i.e. collating statistics but without undertaking effective checks, and, apparently, excluding light commercial vehicles (vans) and heavy commercial vehicles (trucks)."
"It is better than nothing, but not much!"
"Despite its limitations, we nonetheless voted in favour of the González Álvarez report."
"Smet report (A5-0129/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the report on the conciliation process concerning the organisation of working time, first and foremost in support of the article on doctors in training."
"It is, in effect, appropriate for them to be able to rest in-between operations, particularly during their training period, also in consideration of the fact that, during the rest of their careers, it is above all - not exclusively, but for the most part - the elderly who will fall victim to their scalpels."
"The doctors will need to have learnt their trade well, free from considerations of working time."
"Above all, however, my vote for the motion is an invitation to consider reducing not just the working time in a worker' s day but the time he spends working over his entire lifetime."
"It would, in fact, be appropriate for a person not to have to work for 80 years if he is going to live to be 90 years of age, but to work for a period of 30 years if he is going to live to be 60 or 70."
"Madam President, I voted for the amendment of the directive on working times because this directive has been extended to include certain categories which had not been covered. I refer, in particular, to categories of the transport sector."
"Furthermore, I hope that the approval of this directive will prompt a decision, at last, to approve the regulations on flight times and working times for pilots and cabin crew."
"This is not solely a social matter of worker protection - although it does include this factor - but it is also a question of flight safety."
". (EL) It is a fact that man' s strength and capabilities are limited."
"Working times may be harmful to the physical and the mental health of both individuals and families, which is why working times need to be organised so that the safety and health of workers are not put at risk."
"However, 7 million workers in the EU, in transport and fisheries and doctors in training are exempted from Directive 104/93/ÅC on the organisation of working time."
"This intolerable situation and the abuse of workers in the above specialist sectors as regards their working times is of a nature and is taking on dimensions which are such that rules must be imposed without delay, given that workers such as doctors in training in Great Britain work up to 72 hours a week."
"Extending the directive is essential, but it is not enough."
"The provisions proposed will be unable to protect the safety and health of workers effectively, given that there are still numerous exemptions and long transitional periods for implementing the directive."
"We must also bear in mind that the original directive did not stipulate the length of a working day (it stipulated a working week of 48 hours - an implied violation of the measure)."
"- (NL) My Group eventually accepted the compromise reached by the Conciliation Committee to apply the working time directive to the excluded sectors."
"It is now crucial that these sectors can, at long last, look forward to a regulation so that they too come under the scope of the directive."
"We struggle greatly with the long transitional periods for the junior doctors sector."
"After the directive enters into force, the Member States have a total of nine years before they are obliged to have transposed the directive into national legislation."
"Under certain conditions, this period can be extended by another two or three years."
"Needless to say, we feel for the many Member States which struggle with inadequate staffing levels in their health sector."
"However, the Member States have known for a long time that they will need to adapt to the working times directive in the long run."
"It looks very much like this serious problem has been shelved, as a result of which, in our opinion, the arguments used to support the long transitional periods do not so much signify powerlessness as unwillingness."
"In the light of the above, when this directive and the ensuing national legislation is implemented, close monitoring will be required to ensure that the weekly working hours for junior doctors meet the statutory standards."
"- (FR) I can only recommend that this text be adopted, which is the product of a long and difficult conciliation process between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"This favourable vote is of capital importance as it concerns the health and safety of some 7 million workers in Europe."
"Workers in the transport sector and offshore workers, sea fishermen and doctors in training will at last be entitled to benefit from European working hours regulations."
"As a French member of the Parliament' s Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, at second reading, I supported Parliament' s position which, in particular, provided for a four-year transition period for doctors in training, with a maximum working week of 54 hours, over a four month reference period."
"The conciliation process produced an agreement whereby doctors in training will be covered by the directive, as far as its scope of application - a maximum 48-hour working week over a four-month reference period - is concerned, after a period of nine years."
"The nine-year period is to be subdivided as follows: a four-year transposition period and a five-year transition period."
"In the first three years of the transition period, the number of weekly working hours shall not exceed 58, or 56 during the last two years."
"For some States, however, this sort of nine-year period will not be sufficient to carry out the necessary adjustments."
"These States may therefore be permitted an additional period of two years."
"The Commission will make a statement on the notification of the relevant Member State, after consulting employers and workers at European level, as well as representatives of the Member States."
"The notification, the opinion of the Commission and, if this opinion is not acted upon, the Member State' s justification, shall be published in the OJ and sent to the European Parliament."
"If there are specific problems, then the two-year period may be extended for a further year, but the Member State must incorporate the procedure in full."
"The maximum number of weekly working hours may not then exceed 52."
". (PT) I have voted against this report because, as a doctor by profession, I think that the excessive working hours that it proposes for junior doctors are unacceptable."
"- (FR) The text before you, after years of negotiations seeking to define the maximum limits for weekly working hours, is symbolic in more ways than one of the ambiguities and inadequacies of European social policy."
"Firstly, as regards the very principle of a European social policy, the Treaty of Maastricht restricts this to minimum social standards, and only on condition that they do not ""hold back small- and medium-sized undertakings"" ."
"These restrictions are no longer acceptable today. That, then, is one urgent question to be raised for the forthcoming revision of the Treaty."
"Ambiguities and inadequacies are, however, just as evident in the proposal before us."
"Are we sufficiently aware that, in 1994, when the Member States came to an agreement on the maximum 48-hour working week, they excluded several million workers, such as transport workers, offshore oil rig workers or junior doctors in training?"
"Mrs Smet' s proposal extends the general rule of 48 hours to some of these sectors."
"It still does not, however, settle the matter of long-distance road haulage workers and puts forward a frankly ridiculous timescale for implementing the directive with regard to junior doctors!"
"The position of these doctors in training is similar in many countries: working weeks of 70 and 80 hours in conditions that are occasionally disgraceful and sometimes dangerous to patients."
"The recent strike by junior doctors in France showed that such a situation was not acceptable, either for the doctors, the patients or the public health service."
"But, even though, last November, the European Parliament proposed almost unanimously that the 48-hour rule should come into force within four years, it is now suggested that we alter our position radically."
"We should adopt the joint proposal of the ministers and the parliamentary delegation allowing Member States up to twelve years (!) before they apply the 48-hour week directive to doctors in training."
"Please think about what this means exactly. The first doctors in training to benefit from these conditions have just started secondary school!"
"I do not know of a single other area - the euro, the free movement of persons, goods or capital - where a timescale of this order is tolerated."
"In such circumstances, how can we expect the European Union' s social policy to be taken seriously?"
"Especially as the proposal divides this twelve year period into several distinct periods, each with their own rules for the maximum working week:"
"until 2004 there will be no change, there will be no restrictions on working hours;"
"between 2004 and 2007 the maximum working week will be 58 hours;"
"between 2007 and 2009 it will be 56 hours;"
"between 2009 and 2012 it will be 52 hours."
"In adopting this text we are sending out a worrying message."
"This is the first directive on social matters to be adopted since the Lisbon Summit on employment."
"I would like to express the hope that the Commission, Parliament and the Council will, at last, take European social policy more seriously."
"Social Europe will not make progress, nor will it convince our countries' citizens with proposals such as this."
"Roth-Berendt report (A5-0117/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the Roth-Behrendt report, although, as before, my vote in favour of the motion is also a call for improvement of European legislation in the field of the implementation of the precautionary principle."
"It is, of course, right for us to consider our health as human beings and to slaughter the huge number of animals at risk; it is right for us to adopt this measure and thereby establish rules to bring farmers and stock breeders into line, but we also need to keep our feet firmly on the ground."
"What I mean is, right now, I can imagine farmers running along behind their cows - Daisy or Buttercup, maybe - and fussing over feeding them hay, fodder and products from their fields, whereas they may well not have had time to have their animal' s health checked."
"So let us combine practical action with a desire for improvement."
"- (FR) I should like to express my satisfaction with the content of this report."
"Let me remind you that in presenting this proposal for a regulation, the Commission is fulfilling the undertaking it gave in 1997 to the European Parliament' s Temporary Committee of Inquiry to put forward measures for effectively monitoring transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs)."
"This proposal seeks to create a standard legal basis for the monitoring and prevention of TSEs, of whatever type, and for all animal-based products."
"It incorporates all Community regulations in force in the field of TSEs."
"Like the rapporteur, I endorse the general strategy adopted by the European Commission, but I think the text before us needs tightening up in order to guarantee maximum consumer safety."
"I have therefore supported the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"These amendments were intended to introduce the possibility of systematically implementing rapid diagnostic tests, and to reintroduce the European Parliament' s request in the context of the follow-up to the recommendations on BSE, i.e. withdrawing the entire herd from the food chain, banning any movement of animals defined as at risk, and advocating the slaughter and destruction of such animals, with the exception of animals intended for scientific research."
"The proposal also had to be extended by inviting the Commission to present proposals for the inclusion of some cosmetic products and medicines, and to draw up a procedure for determining the epidemiological status of countries or regions in relation to BSE, i.e. a classification of countries according to contamination levels."
"I shall conclude by stressing the fact that the European Parliament must continue to be involved, under the codecision procedure, in fundamental decisions on the prevention of TSEs."
"- (FR) The problem under discussion this morning was first identified a long time ago."
"It is all very laudable to attempt to prevent the risks of BSE at Community level today, but it was almost 15 years ago that our researchers clearly established that one of the causes of mad cow disease was the consumption of cattle fodder containing animal-based meal made from ingredients taken from the carcasses of sheep suffering from ovine scrapie."
"This is why, when we contributed towards setting up the Parliament' s Temporary Committee of Inquiry into BSE, we pointed out most forcefully that any regulatory instrument should necessarily cover all transmissible spongiform encephalopathies."
"Why has it been necessary to wait so long to effect the necessary changes in the regulations?"
"Why is there this time lag between scientific discoveries and Community proposals?"
"Fortunately, as far as the protection of the citizens is concerned, reactions at national level and in a number of Member States were rather more rapid and effective, compared with the incredible slowness and the usual paradoxes of Community bureaucracy."
"Let me remind you that some countries, in effect, in order to ensure consumer food safety, have had to deliberately contravene Community regulations."
"It is a perfectly good idea to make the use of rapid diagnostic tests more widespread."
"They will be a significant component of BSE monitoring at Community level."
"Let us not, however, treat them like a universal panacea."
"These tests can only detect the affected prion protein above a certain level."
"They are therefore no substitute for, in particular, the withdrawal of specific high-risk materials."
"Above all, it would be an outrage if Member States which have set up a screening programme based on tests far stricter than the Community programme were to be penalised, in terms of classification with regard to BSE-related risks, in comparison with States which have confined themselves to the minimum Community programme."
"Community regulations should never represent a brake on, or obstacle to, the action of Member States that wish to offer their citizens more stringent protection."
"It has been clear since the start of the BSE crisis that the most appropriate and effective level of protection for our citizens is directly linked to the vigilance of the national authorities, with Community procedures, when they finally come to be drawn up, being able, of course, to play a useful complementary role."
"Savary report (A5-0113/2000)"
"Madam President, I should briefly like to pay tribute to the work done by our fellow Member, Mr Savary, who has once again shown himself to be a staunch defender of the railways and of public services."
"Next I should like to tell the people who voted in favour of this report that I, of course, agreed with saying that it is no longer possible to accept the share of rail transport increasingly losing out to road transport, and that nor is it possible to accept the technical, and even regulatory, obstacles from a bygone age that stand in the way of the much-needed freedom of movement throughout the whole of Europe?"
"All the same, for future reference, I wish to state today that making this observation and supporting this determination to make progress must not lead to untrammelled liberalisation and privatisation, as this puts our safety at risk, and we can see many examples of this today in some countries of Europe, and it is destructive as far as our public service is concerned."
"This is not the purpose of today' s report but, in view of debates we will have in future, I wished to state this publicly."
"Madam President, although we are in favour of completely harmonising European rail networks and making them compatible, since this is a necessity, and although we are in favour of developing this type of public transport, both on major international routes as well as on regional and local networks, we abstained from the vote on this report, since nowhere did it mention the need to operate rail networks as a public service, i.e. as a system designed and put into practice in order to respond to the needs of users and not to be a source of profit for private companies."
"Madam President, I voted for the measure contained within the Savary report, on the trans-European conventional rail system."
"How could I do otherwise?"
"This is a clearly a matter in which the European Union must intervene on account of the subsidiarity principle."
"Long-distance transport can only be regulated at European level."
"Nevertheless, there was room for improvement in this measure, but I hope that this will be achieved over the next few years."
"We should use this as a springboard to create, at last, a European department of transport links, but, first and foremost, we should make it easier for pensioners and the elderly to travel between the European capitals."
"Pensioners love to travel and could have the right to a free travel card for journeys between their capital city or their own town and the capital cities of the other 14 European States."
"We must give our support to the interoperability of European railways as a means of revitalising and developing the sector at international level, in order better to meet users' needs, and also as an instrument for protecting the environment."
"Nevertheless, we do not feel that adequate solutions to the problems arising for those working in the sector as a result of this process have been provided in the texts before us."
"We are also aware, and are therefore bound to express our concern about this, that the proposals currently being discussed are part of a package of measures designed to liberalise the sector, and that the experiments that have already been carried out in this area have certainly led to a deterioration in safety and social conditions for workers."
"Savary report (A5-0112/2000)"
"Madam President, I voted for the second Savary report, which differs from the previous report in that it refers to a trans-European high-speed rail system."
"My point, this time, is that there is also room for improvement in this high-speed European transport system, in that it should be designed for use by ordinary citizens as well as businessmen who want to travel from Madrid to Copenhagen or somewhere even further away in as short a time as possible: businessmen can always go by plane."
"High-speed links must, first and foremost, be designed for tourism, leisure and the enjoyment of all European citizens, especially the elderly, who would be avid travellers if conditions were more luxurious and rail travel a more pleasurable experience."
"- I voted against the report on the trans-European high-speed system (A5-0112/2000)."
"It is most enlightening to compare the two reports presented by our colleague, Mr Savary, even if these documents have different legal bases."
"The high-speed sector and the conventional rail system respond to quite different philosophies."
"The former report received unanimous support in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Only half of the Members of the very same committee voted for the latter."
"This fact is, in itself, expressive enough."
"On the high-speed rail system report the Environment Committee, astonishingly, did not deliver any opinion, even if the environmental aspects are not mentioned in it at all."
"It seems that most people in this House do not really care about the need to rebalance the different modes of transport in favour of the railways, to reach a significant rise in the volume of goods and passengers that nowadays overwhelmingly use the roads."
"- (FR) First of all I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work on the Commission' s report on the implementation and effects of Directive 96/48/EC concerning the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system."
"Creating the technical conditions for the interoperability of the European railway networks involves harmonising, between the various networks, the many different systems and components involved in rail transport."
"The objective is a threefold one: to gradually create the conditions for the uninterrupted movement of trains on the 15 national networks - the free movement objective; to eliminate current high costs and delays in order to improve the competitiveness and reliability of the railways vis-à-vis their competitors - the sustainable mobility objective; and to create the conditions for a single European market in railway rolling stock by harmonising the elements that make up the railways - the economic and technological objective."
"The objective of the directive before us today was to publish the technical specifications for interoperability (TSIs) for six sub-systems - Maintenance, Infrastructure, Energy, Rolling Stock, Operation and Control-Command - beginning the work of standardising components in collaboration with CEN, Cenelec and ETSI, and establishing in each Member State a list of notified bodies instructed to assess the conformity of the components produced by the relevant industries."
"This report, drawn up pursuant to Directive 96/48/CE, gives an initial assessment of the progress made."
"It must be noted that four years after the directive was adopted, not one single technical specification for interoperability (TSI) has been drawn up even though interoperability is deemed to be fundamental to the mobility of persons and the effectiveness of trans-European rail systems."
"The majority of Member States have not, to date, transposed the provisions of this directive into their national legislation."
"We are a long way from debating the priority to be given to rail!"
"It would, however, be unfair to say that no progress has been made."
"For one thing, a tripartite body, the EARI (European Association for Railway Interoperability), has been set up and has undertaken the work of identifying and specifying existing technologies, components and procedures, which should culminate in two TSIs in the near future."
"Moreover, the latest high-speed network investment projects, designed along the lines of Thalys, have, for the first time, made efforts to achieve convergence and technical coherence."
"Even so, these achievements are still inadequate in terms of the issues at stake."
"National disparities are a considerable obstacle to the development of rail transport in Europe, in spite of the many advantages of this means of transport in terms of sustainable development, pollution and safety."
"The figures speak for themselves: in 1970, the railways had a 21% share of the goods transport market; today they have only 8.5%."
"The trend is the same for passengers, where the market share has dropped from 10% in 1970 to 6%."
"Where freight is concerned, the railways could quite easily disappear altogether from large areas of the goods transport market."
"There is no doubt that the closure of large parts of the European network would lead to significant job losses."
"It is therefore essential to give a fresh boost to interoperability."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Adoption of single currency by Greece (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A5­0135/2000) by Mr Goebbels, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision pursuant to Article 122(2) of the EC Treaty for the adoption of the single currency by Greece on 1.1.2001."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to congratulate Greece on its extraordinary economic progress."
"The Commission has now concluded that Greece fulfils all the convergence criteria."
"I am convinced that Parliament will take the same view."
"It is quite an achievement to meet the convergence requirements and, at the same time, as Greece is doing now, to achieve increases in growth and employment."
"Europe, especially the remaining convergence countries - Sweden and Greece - are now showing that it is fully possible to fulfil the stability requirements of the convergence process and still maintain a dynamic economy with growth and falling unemployment."
"Against that background, I have no reservations about recommending that Greece join the euro zone as from 2001."
"Sweden, too, fulfils the basic economic requirements."
"The Swedish economy is now one of Europe' s strongest, with low inflation, high growth and a balance of payments surplus."
"However, Sweden still does not fulfil all of the more formal requirements."
"It has not joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) and Swedish legislation concerning the Bank of Sweden still does not completely fulfil the requirements of the Treaty."
"However, the Swedish Parliament has instituted a number of changes to the legislation concerning monetary policy in order to facilitate Sweden joining the euro."
"The remaining changes will be made when Sweden actually applies to join the euro, partly by applying to join the ERM."
"I am very well aware of the implications of the Treaty."
"But in a Euro-sceptic country like Sweden, which still feels itself to be a new Member State, there is a democratic imperative for a change as major as that of joining the euro to be preceded by a careful democratic process."
"At the Committee hearing, Commissioner Solbes declared that it is the individual country which applies to enter the ERM."
"Where Sweden' s entry is concerned, it is therefore my and, as I understand it, the Commission' s judgement that to want full status in EMU by entering the ERM is to adopt a political position."
"Commissioner Solbes said in the Committee that he respects the Swedish government' s desire to allow the people to decide the question in a referendum."
"We are therefore also grateful for the phrases in Mr Goebbels' report in which he welcomes this democratic process."
"I, who am working hard in favour of Swedish 'euro membership' , am convinced that, in a few years' time, we shall also make the same decision for Sweden as we are now making in the case of Greece, i.e. to welcome and approve Sweden as a fully-fledged member of the Economic and Monetary Union and of the single currency."
"I look forward to that day."
"Mr President, I would like to make a brief comment concerning Sweden."
"Sweden joined the European Union without an opt-out, certainly not in respect of monetary union."
"Only on points such as legislation, which is in Sweden' s remit, does the country not meet the criteria."
"There is talk of a referendum coming up."
"I would like to know when exactly that will be as I am sure there is not a date for this yet."
"How long will it be before the Commission does its duty and reminds Sweden' s Social Democratic government of its signature under a very important contract?"
"The Swedish government sets an extremely bad example for the candidate countries which are, at this moment, waiting to join."
"Mr President, I would now like to move on to Greece."
"I have a problem with that country."
"The Greeks have produced a fantastic achievement."
"I only wonder how long the effects of that achievement will last."
"But I am acutely aware that by punishing Greece for achieving something positive, we will let the actual guilty party off the hook."
"Greece probably does not meet the criteria any more or less than other countries did."
"The euro zone should be able to carry a relatively small economy such as the Greek one quite easily."
"At the moment, however, this sends out the wrong psychological message to the markets and citizens who, to use an appropriate metaphor, look upon the euro descending Mount Olympus with sadness in their eyes."
"This is why Parliament, on behalf of the citizen, has to send out a signal to the Union' s large Member States."
"But the Central Bank, for example, is not concerned with the euro' s external value."
"The true culprits are the governments of Germany, France, Belgium and especially Italy."
"These countries, however, are making a mess of their own responsibilities vis-à-vis the currency and vis-à-vis the European citizen, let alone their own citizens."
"They do not introduce the required structural reform within their own markets."
"Governments are far too accommodating when agreements are not met, under the motto: you meet the agreements today, I might meet them tomorrow."
"Why is Italy not called to task when it makes a shambles of its good intentions?"
"The large Member States and Belgium are trifling with the interests of all European citizens."
"It is said time and again that the European citizens are not adversely affected as long as they stay in Europe."
"But surely, Mr President, we should not make that decision for them?"
"In the Netherlands, many farmers are emigrating to North America."
"A weak euro lets them down badly."
"Businesses within the European Union have become 25% cheaper for the United States to buy."
"I think it is time for some changes."
"I will be abstaining from the votes today."
"Mr President, I am wholly and unequivocally in favour of Greece' s adoption of the single European currency, the euro."
"As Mr Goebbels stated in his report, the European Parliament' s task is not to assess practical adherence to the Maastricht criteria, for that has already been done, item by item, by the Commission and the bodies whose task it is to monitor these indicators and keep us informed."
"The European Parliament must express a political opinion; it must speak from the heart and not on the basis of figures; it must listen to its soul instead of numbers."
"What sort of European Union is it in which one of the 15 States, which wishes to accede to the most committed and most important level of European cohesion, is still left standing outside the door?"
"When, as the report maintains, we consider that all the Maastricht criteria are fulfilled and that, in addition, this country is called Greece - an enchanting name in itself - we cannot fail to realise that this cannot continue and be moved to remedy the situation."
"And I refer, in particular, to the Greek pensioners."
"You may wonder why, as representative of the Italian Pensioners' Party, I am interested in Greek pensioners."
"But Mr President, if we have to ask Greece to reduce its State deficit - and, unfortunately, we know that, nowadays, this is only achieved by reducing pensions - instead of avoiding wastage - which, as the previous speaker said, in socialist governments, especially, is due to poor budgetary allocations - we must not make the pensioners and elderly citizens of Greece pay the price for its accession to the European currency."
"Mr President, the euro was born two years ago."
"For me, as a Europhile, it was a great day when monetary union was brought to a successful conclusion, exactly as planned and with as many as 11 Member States."
"For me, as a Swede, it was disappointing that Swedish Social Democracy had not been able to deliver a result then and there."
"Now, two years have gone by - without any response or progress on Sweden' s part."
"We are, unfortunately, the country without an EMU strategy."
"For my part, I can only congratulate Greece as the twelfth country to adopt the euro."
"Now that our discussions are focusing upon Greece and we are carefully picking over the Greek economy, all EU countries ought to join Greece in also adopting the euro."
"Many people are to be heard explaining the fall in value of the euro with reference to the fact that the United States' s economy is stronger than Europe' s."
"That is indisputable."
"It is amazing, however, that more is not being done by Europe to reverse this trend."
"For me, the reason for this is clear."
"There is a lack of confidence in the European governments."
"It is time to implement the structural changes which are often talked about but which are still not being carried out."
"With lower taxes and a more flexible labour market, Europe can enter the new economy."
"There needs to be more rationalisation of the budget, more exposure to competition, more deregulation and a more rapid phasing-out of monopolies."
"If the governments of Europe give priority to this work, we shall immediately find confidence in the euro increasing."
"But many of the EU' s social democratic-led governments are visibly unable to take action."
"There is a lack of leadership."
"It is not the President of the ECB who can 'talk up' the euro."
"Instead, it is the Member States which can make the EU and the euro competitive."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Goebbels for his report and also the various participants in this debate."
"Today we are studying the report on convergence, which deals with the Swedish and Greek problems."
"With regard to Sweden, the situation has hardly changed since 1998."
"The economic situation is positive, but the legislative adaptation of its Central Bank is not being carried out and it is not a member of the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS."
"With regard to Greece, the situation is radically different."
"Greece did not fulfil the convergence criteria in 1998 but now it does."
"By that I mean that it fulfils them in the strictest sense, using exactly the same criteria as in 1998."
"Greece has clearly made a great effort and I therefore have nothing to add to the positive results highlighted by Mr Goebbels in his report."
"I would like to talk about some of the points which have been mentioned today, given the concern about the Greek model."
"I understand that concern because Greece offers a precedent not only for the new candidate countries but also for the current Member States who, in the future, may join the single currency."
"In this respect, it is quite clear that the way we deal with Greece will be crucial but I want to insist that Greece has been treated in the same way as all the other countries when their situation was considered back in 1998."
"There have basically been two issues of concern: debt and inflation."
"Are they sustainable?"
"Is this inflation situation sustainable, or durable, as you call it?"
"In the case of Greece, debt stands at more than 100% of GDP, practically the same as in Belgium or Italy."
"I do not think it is reasonable to compare the current situation in Greece with that prevailing in Italy or Belgium."
"We must not forget that Belgium and Italy have benefited from the fall in debt resulting from the reduction in interest rates, which is due, in particular, to the approximation of the interest rates of their Central Banks with those of the European Central Bank."
"In comparative terms, the Greek situation is similar to the Italian or Belgian situation at the time of their accession to the single currency."
"The second point of concern is inflation."
"I understand this concern on the basis of two arguments: firstly, it is true that the level of inflation necessary to comply with the criteria was achieved relatively recently; secondly, there will also be a reduction in the interest rates and this will have a positive effect on speeding up the reduction in deficit and debt, but which may generate tensions in the market."
"With regard to the first point, concerning whether Greece has achieved this inflation rate in a manner which is unsustainable, I must make a few comments."
"Greece has been complying with the inflation criteria for some months and the situation is improving considerably."
"This morning I had the opportunity to discuss the Greek figures which were issued a few days ago by the Greek national statistical service."
"The Eurostat figures were also published this morning."
"At the moment, the harmonised CPI, in the case of Greece, stands at 2.1%, a drop of 0.7% on the March figure; this is a better situation, for example, than certain countries of the monetary union, such as Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg and Finland."
"In comparative terms, therefore, Greece' s current situation is quite sound."
"If we abide by the strict criterion of the last 12 months, we will see that inflation currently stands at 2%."
"This is clearly better than the situation in Spain and Ireland, and practically the same as Italy, Luxembourg or the Netherlands."
"Therefore, in terms of figures, I believe that we should not worry about the Greek situation."
"However, the Commission also shares the concern which certain MEPs have highlighted."
"We have therefore insisted on two points in discussing both the broad guidelines for economic policies and the convergence report."
"Greece has to do two things, and the Greek Government is prepared to do them and has committed itself to doing them: Firstly, it must continue with its liberalisation policies and structural reforms which will improve the inflation situation; secondly, Greece must continue with its policy of reducing the deficit, but in a context of combining policies, a 'policy mix' , which will allow it, in the event that an increase in demand, resulting from a reduction in interest rates, may create tension in terms of inflation, to reconsider its tax policy so that it will not have negative effects on the process of integration into Monetary Union."
"I am convinced that all of that will happen, and the Greek Government has committed itself to ensuring that it does."
"I therefore believe that the entry of Greece into the euro will help rather than hinder it."
"The euro has shown that it is still an attractive currency which some countries want to join."
"I hope that the path being taken by Greece will be followed by other Member States in the next few years."
"This is the end of a process."
"We must wait for its culmination with the decisions in June, but I am convinced that, by welcoming Greece into the euro when the time is right, we will generate more confidence in the face of any other type of arguments against the future progress of the single currency."
"Mr President, I have asked the Commissioner when he will do his duty as far as Sweden is concerned and remind the Social Democratic government of a signature which was placed here by Sweden."
"When will the Commission enforce the Treaty?"
"The Commission always respects the Treaty. It is obliged to comply with it."
"Please do not forget that it is a fact that Sweden is not participating because its Central Bank has not adapted to the European requirements, a decision which falls to the Swedish authorities."
"Secondly, we should not forget either that participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS is a voluntary decision."
"You may ask whether this is contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Maastricht, but it is clearly not a point which we can debate at the moment."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Solbes Mira."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings"
"The next item is the report (A5-0109/2000) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on a proposal for a Commission directive amending Directive 80/723/EEC on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings (SEC(1999) 404 - C5-0102/2000 - 2000/2065(COS))."
"Mr President, Article 86 of the Treaty captures the very essence of the resolution."
"Paragraph 1 stipulates that in the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which Member States grant special or exclusive rights, Member States shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the rules contained in this Treaty."
"Paragraph 2 adds, in summary, that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest shall be subject to the rules contained in this Treaty."
"It is up to the Commission to monitor the observation of this Article and to provide fitting directives or decisions to the Member States."
"The amendment to the directive to which this resolution pertains must enable the Commission to carry out this task more effectively, which is certainly necessary given the ever growing liberalisation of recent years."
"Public undertakings and former public undertakings increasingly embrace the commercial world where they, partly with government funding, engage in competition with private undertakings, i.e. their own citizens."
"Let it be clear, then, that the much desired level playing field no longer exists."
"The present situation promotes money wasting, distorts international trade and, as such, forms a threat to the internal market."
"It is surely only logical and reasonable that public undertakings, at the time when they enter into the market, should abide by the same rules as private undertakings."
"As a means of guaranteeing a level playing field, the Commission has decided that undertakings with a net turnover in excess of EUR 40 million should keep separate accounts which should illustrate the different activities, the costs and profits pertaining to each of the activities, the method according to which costs and profit are accounted for and the way in which the net profits generated by each activity are used."
"These are the considerations with regard to the proposal."
"In short, what is the origin of investments in the commercial field?"
"Initially, the Commission proposal met with a great deal of resistance from EMAC and the Commission."
"In actual fact, there was only a handful of PPE-DE Members and the Liberal Group who were in favour of the planned transparency."
"This caused me concern."
"We, as MEPs, are elected to exercise democratic control over the executive, in this case the Commission."
"The Commission is, in turn, responsible for observing Article 86."
"We thus have the duty to ensure that the Commission carries out the assigned task properly but, at the same time, some of us would prevent it from doing exactly that."
"I wonder how we must come across in a situation like this."
"We make it abundantly clear that we strive for fair competition and utilisation of our internal market but, when the chips are down, we are once again looking solely after our own interests."
"In the report on the adoption of the single currency by Greece, I blame the governments for not doing what needs to be done."
"Those against this directive are thus giving the governments a helping hand."
"As Parliament, we cannot do anything else but to ensure that the markets operate clearly and transparently and that we do not give preferential treatment to certain undertakings and not others."
"This directive may seem tedious, but is, in reality, the acid test."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make three points regarding this directive, and the consultation, on which I should like to congratulate our rapporteur."
"I think she has managed to come up with a reasonable balance within our committee in what almost became, on occasions, an ideological debate."
"In your proposal, Commissioner, you quite rightly exclude a number of sectors, and we can only be pleased at this."
"Secondly, as our rapporteur pointed out, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the jurisdiction of Member States in this field must not be disregarded."
"At the present time, there is no definition of services of general economic interest at European Union level."
"We must therefore bring subsidiarity into play, and we are well aware that in such areas, national sensibilities may be expressed in diverse ways."
"I can therefore only urge you, Commissioner, to show as much drive and determination in making full use of all the terms of the Treaty, particularly those which, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, grant you new scope for action, especially with a view to defining the ability to provide services of general economic interest."
"I would urge Mrs Peijs to read again the latest version of the Treaty with regard to what she considers to be the last word on the law on competition within the European Union."
"My third observation, Commissioner, is on public broadcasting services."
"Once again, I cannot ignore what we incorporated into our Treaty when we amended it in Amsterdam."
"This sector is very clearly covered by specific conditions."
"This shows the determination of the Member States to treat this sector as a sector in its own right falling outside the rules of competition which exist in other areas."
"I therefore feel that the proposals on transparency that you are putting forward cannot be applied to that sector under the same conditions."
"I think it would be rather difficult in such a sector to implement the notion of separate accounting systems making it possible to draw a distinction between competitive activities and public service activities in the broadcasting sector, especially as, I might mention in passing, there is no single harmonised European accounting system."
"I just wanted to complain about the quality of sound reproduction."
"There is a bad echo in the Chamber, as a result of which we can hardly hear those speaking in their original languages."
"Can something be done about this?"
"We will try to resolve the problem you have raised in your speech, Mrs Maes."
"Mr President, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the Commission' s proposal, which will lead to increased public scrutiny of public undertakings and to increased competition."
"We want to thank Mrs Randzio-Plath for cooperating so well."
"State aid distorts competition and is unfair to both consumers and companies."
"In principle, the Treaty prohibits all types of state aid, including cross-subsidies."
"The Treaty does not, however, prohibit the existence of public undertakings providing services in the public interest."
"Whatever one may think about this, it is for the Member States themselves to define what is meant by services in the public interest."
"The Member States should not, however, themselves decide what kinds of aid they will be granting these undertakings."
"The Court of First Instance in Luxembourg stated as late as last week that state support for TV and radio companies may only be provided once the Commission has said that this is compatible with the Treaty."
"The rules must be applied in the same way to all parties."
"All aid which is not used to finance services in the public interest is prohibited and is to be opposed."
"State radio stations and TV companies now often provide services which are outside the scope of what we call services in the public interest."
"An example is Internet connection."
"Those resources which the State has injected into companies to finance their basic activities ought not, of course, to be used to finance the provision of Internet connections."
"In that case, competition is distorted, to the disadvantage both of consumers and of private companies."
"The Commission' s proposal requires companies to openly account for the resources provided to them as public undertakings and for how these have been used."
"Companies must also show what costs they have, where their income comes from and how this is derived from their various activities."
"These are very reasonable demands."
"Both these obligations are simple means of upholding the rules governing relations between private and public undertakings."
"This is important for the purpose of maintaining proper rules in the internal market."
"Mr President, Commissioner Monti, on the subject of the proposal before us, I should like to make four remarks or observations on behalf of my Group, but not without first congratulating our fellow Member, Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"First of all, I should like to thank Commissioner Monti for having had the courtesy to consult the European Parliament."
"A Commission directive has been referred to us, even though, I believe, it is not legally mandatory to consult Parliament, although the subject is clearly a crucial one."
"This leads me to reiterate the hope that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will propose subjecting all legislation on competition policy to the codecision procedure, thereby enabling us legally to work on a more equal footing."
"My second comment concerns the actual purpose of this proposed directive."
"It has an extremely specific aim, which is to prevent, subject to monitoring by the Commission, any legitimate public aid to services of general interest being misappropriated to the benefit of activities which are themselves open to competition."
"Having said that, the problem is by no means easy to solve, as the previous speaker made clear."
"Indeed he states - and I would be curious to know Mr Monti' s response to this - that Internet connection does not, for example, come under the heading of universal service."
"I think that this runs quite counter to the objectives of the European Council in Lisbon, and that it is necessary, on the contrary, to have a comprehensive vision of universal service."
"One might go so far as to imagine, even if this is a matter for subsidiarity, that the Community as such should at least define the minimum standards of what the universal service may be."
"Otherwise we are heading towards a relatively chaotic situation."
"Thirdly, I should like to know the Commission' s reaction to Recital No 4 of our report, in which the rapporteur and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs effectively ask the Commission to specify how important it considers services of general interest to be."
"I await the Commission' s response on the matter."
"Fourthly and finally, there is one amendment, Amendment No 3, which is explicitly intended to exclude the broadcasting sector from the scope of the proposed directive."
"I think this amendment is an improvement on the current text. Paragraph 6 is a masterpiece of diplomatic language but is relatively incomprehensible."
"I should therefore like to see the Commission expressing its support for Amendment No 3 as proposed in plenary."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I would like to join my colleagues in thanking Commissioner Monti for consulting Parliament on this matter and in congratulating our rapporteur for her great job."
"The tenor of this report relates to analysing which public undertakings can receive financial aid from the Member State governments operating within the EU."
"There are clearly opposing views in this House on this subject matter."
"There are those who would like to see undertakings which are only in direct competition with the private sector to be subject to the terms of this directive, whilst others would propose that public undertakings which are clearly of a general interest could fall within the exceptions in this directive."
"It can be said that the right reserved to Member States to determine what constitutes service of general interest is preserved, and the one area that I would like to deal with specifically is the question of broadcasting."
"I would like to remind this House that the protocol attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam of the EU recognises that the system of public broadcasting within Member States of the EU is directly related to the democratic, social and cultural needs of our society."
"We must ensure that with the advance of new technology the public service broadcast ethos is not undermined."
"I would argue that it is more essential, now that we have a strong public service broadcasting sector, to ensure the maintenance of that democratic, social and cultural sector."
"In conclusion, Mr President, this is why I believe the role of public service broadcasters must be maintained, and while I welcome the fact that the right must be reserved to Member States to determine what constitutes ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I also wish to add my congratulations to Mrs Randzio-Plath for the work on this report, which has been difficult at times."
"This directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies which distort competition."
"In order to do this, the directive proposes to require public undertakings and private undertakings that perform public tasks to carry out separate accounting procedures."
"I obviously agree with the rapporteur that competition rules must be applied rigorously in order to prevent cross-subsidies that go against the purpose of the aid."
"However, in the sphere of public broadcasting it is essential to remember that, in accordance with the Amsterdam Protocol, in the system of public broadcasting in Member States, it is up to each Member State to specify the financial and organisational structure of public service broadcasting."
"This has, as I said, been a difficult report; it has been fraught and often very tense in committee and, more specifically, at the committee votes."
"However, I believe the final outcome will work and is a practical and correct approach."
"Mr President, despite this discussion in Parliament concerning the changes which the Commission would like to make to the directive on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings, we will not have much of a say in it because it will be the Commission, and the Commission only, that will make decisions without further involving the European Parliament or the Council, much to our regret."
"In our opinion, on the basis of its autonomous powers concerning competition policy, the Commission approaches some sectors from a purely economic angle without taking into consideration other social aspects."
"For example, in the dossier on financing public broadcasting, the Commission still overlooks the cultural aspects and the aspect of media-pluralism, to our mind."
"Admittedly, an exception is made but then this exception accommodates further exceptions."
"For example, it is very difficult for public broadcasting to survive in an increasingly commercialised environment."
"I am against the commercialisation of culture."
"In my opinion, culture is above these market laws."
"The Commission has thus overstepped the mark. With this amendment to the directive, it is trying to change the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely the public broadcasting protocol which was attached to it."
"I am, therefore, of the opinion that the IGC should apply the normal legislative procedure for codecision by the Council and Parliament to general competition policy legislation."
"I can already tell you that I will be here once again when you produce a directive on film."
"Mr President, I congratulate the European Parliament on the major work accomplished during the debate on the Randzio-Plath report."
"I would particularly like to thank Parliament for the support it has shown for the Commission' s initiative and I welcome its approval of the steps to increase transparency in the use of public resources and thereby guarantee fair competition."
"You welcomed the Commission' s consultation of Parliament, despite the fact that it was not obliged to do this under its institutional statutes as Mr Jonckheer and other speakers recalled."
"Moreover, the way the debate went reassures me that it was useful for the Commission and in the best interests of the initiative for Parliament to be consulted."
"As it stands, the directive on transparency gives the Commission the authority to carry out inquiries into financial relations between Member States and their public undertakings."
"In short, the draft amendment to the directive is intended to ensure the introduction of separate accounting procedures for specific types of firms."
"The firms affected by this measure are those which, on the one hand, provide services of general economic interest in exchange for various different types of compensation, which may be special dues or payments, and, on the other, also perform normal general activities, thereby operating in competition with other firms."
"Clearly, the profits generated by the continuation of reserved activities or by compensation provided for reasons of general interest or public service are not intended to finance competitive activities, and must therefore not give rise to internal subsidies."
"However, in recent years, the Commission has had to examine a growing number of claims related precisely to such internal compensation."
"As Mrs Peijs mentioned, in the course of its inquiries, the Commission has had to examine these cases of internal compensation and it was frequently unable to obtain sufficient information regarding the costs and profits generated by the various activities."
"Therefore, the Commission now proposes to introduce a system of separate accounts for these types of companies which will allow them to perform their role as surety for competition properly."
"I would also like to stress that the obligation to keep separate accounts also benefits the Member States, in that it provides them with the necessary information in order to avoid granting state aid which does not comply with the Treaty and to notify the Commission of the aid envisaged."
"The directive requires that companies which provide general services and which, at the same time, operate outside that public service mission, keep separate accounts."
"This requirement applies to both private and public companies."
"The directive does not apply to companies which only provide general services and do not carry on any other activity, nor does it require the separation of different activities which all come under the heading of general services."
"In other words, ladies and gentlemen, the directive is intended to make the areas around the line between services of general interest and other activities transparent with the minimum of disruption."
"I would like to emphasise the fact that the directive makes no changes either, of course, to the provisions of the Treaty on the awarding of general services, or to the awarding of the management of these services to specific companies."
"The directive lays down the principles for the introduction of greater transparency, although, in observance of the subsidiarity principle, it leaves the Member States free to adopt appropriate national measures."
"I would now like to turn to some of the comments made."
"Mr Jonckheer wondered whether Internet access was to be included in the universal service."
"On this point, I can only say that the last Telecommunications Council did hold a debate on this matter."
"As regards the doubts expressed by the rapporteur, Mrs Randzio-Plath, I would briefly like to summarise them."
"On the subject of the definition of general services, I would stress once again that the directive does not make any changes, it does not reduce the current competences of the Member States - Mrs Berès and Mr Langen - regarding the definition of public interest."
"This also applies to the public broadcasting sector, in respect of which the Amsterdam Protocol confirmed the competence of the Member States in the definition of the admission of public service."
"Mrs Berès, Mr Jonckheer, Mr Crowley, Mr Skinner and Mrs Maes remarked that it might be possible to exclude broadcasting."
"I have to say that this sector could well be among the fields where the directive is most frequently applied, where this directive on transparency is of most service, for, even taking the Amsterdam Protocol into account, of course, this nevertheless leaves the Commission with the task of verifying that aid granted for the provision of public services is not excessive in respect of the costs."
"A requirement for verification therefore remains, and this directive should be useful for this purpose."
"The size of company is irrelevant, and I am now addressing Mr Langen et al: the EUR 40 million threshold excludes small- and medium-sized businesses."
"If we were to raise this threshold we would be excluding companies where, due to their size, we cannot suppose that the aid does not affect trade between Member States."
"In any case, in order to give an idea of the size, only 0.2% of all non-farming enterprises in the Community are above this threshold."
"Finally, I would like to say - and it appears that this has been perfectly well understood by the Members of Parliament - that this directive is not in the slightest an attack on public companies."
"Quite the opposite, to be honest, I see it as a great show of support for public companies."
"This is because it provides clarity and therefore does not expose public services to the attacks which would otherwise have been levelled at them."
"As Mr Olle Schmidt stressed, this transparency is essential not only for a proper application of competition policy but, indeed, if I may say so, it is also crucial for there to be a proper relationship between the authorities and the taxpayers, the citizens."
"I therefore feel that, although, as Mrs Peijs stressed, this directive may appear extremely tedious, it actually allows us to get to the heart of the issue, not only of competition but also of civil coexistence and economic democracy."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Poor countries' debt"
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Tajani, Mr van Velzen and Mr Poettering for their valuable, substantial contributions to this debate."
"I also welcome the mandate conferred on me by the European People' s Party to present such a major topic as the poor countries' debt, which is stifling the economy of the world' s poorest developing countries."
"The scale of this issue is global, and it involves all the civilised, democratic countries which are helplessly standing by, watching the constant growth of the debt of poor countries, which now have to set aside an average of 40% of their annual budget to finance it."
"Every year, the debt increases by approximately 12%, and it has risen from USD 110 billion in the 80s to its present value of USD 350 billion."
"Parliament has attempted to deal with the issue on more than one occasion, but it has never appeared to find satisfactory solutions."
"This year, on account of it being a Jubilee Year, the Holy See and other quarters are calling for the substantial reduction, if not total cancellation, of the international debt in such a way as to facilitate the integration of the most indebted countries into the world production and commercial trade circuit."
"The UN Secretary-General also fervently appealed, on 3 April last, to the donor countries and international financial institutions to cancel all the official debts of the highly indebted poor countries from their accounts as a millennium gesture."
"A similar appeal was made by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, but the time for appeals has passed."
"It is facts that are important now."
"If we analyse the situation, we realise that, on the one hand, we are talking about an almost irrecoverable debt and, on the other, that in return for cancelling that debt, we can demand greater respect for human rights, greater democracy and social actions benefiting poor communities - improving conditions for children, the elderly and the disabled."
"In addition, we would be stemming migration flows, which, quite apart from being a problem for the migrants' countries of origin, are, above all, a problem for the host countries."
"Therefore, I would ask whether the Council is aware of all the initiatives which have hitherto been adopted by each individual country of the Union to reduce or cancel the debt of highly indebted poor countries, and whether it would be possible for a résumé to be produced showing the practical actions which have been undertaken by these countries and the commitments made, to prove that these initiatives are not just mere political vote-winning manoeuvres, as they all too often appear to be."
"Finally, considering that there is a clear need for a common foreign policy displaying Europe as a coherent system capable of undertaking united initiatives, does the Commission not feel that it would be appropriate to create a structure to study this issue, which would work together with the local Churches, NGOs and civil society and act upon the conclusions reached?"
"This would, I feel, be a different way of interpreting the meaning of the millennium, this time in the name of solidarity between communities."
"Mr President, resolving the problem of the external debt of less developed countries is undoubtedly an essential factor in the stability, security and development of these countries, in eradicating poverty and in stemming the migratory flows that affect and weaken them."
"We are all aware of the situation."
"These countries' resources - and even resources that they do not have - are used up to service their debts; for some of these countries, interest and capital repayments account for 40% of their budget."
"In spite of this, the debt continues to grow exponentially, and there is consequently an ever-widening gap between these countries and the industrialised countries, which often behave like unscrupulous moneylenders."
"The imposition of unsuitable structural adjustment programmes by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and inadequate cooperation and development aid actions by the industrialised countries, which fall considerably short of the 0.7% of GDP recommended by the United Nations, both contribute to this gap."
"There is an erroneous, trade-based concept that has also made matters worse. This concept suggests that, under the auspices of the WTO, the market can regulate and resolve everything, whereas the opposite is true: economic globalisation has greatly contributed to accentuating disparities, increasing injustice and holding back development."
"It is obvious that this situation must, therefore, be resolved by adopting a worldwide project and by a new world order that puts the development of these countries at the top of its priorities. This must be based on the idea that everyone, and I mean everyone, including the rich countries, will benefit from this development."
"A project of this kind can only succeed through debt relief, which cannot be reduced to a process that is merely full of good intentions, as recommended by the G7 countries, whose contribution represents no more than 1% of Third World debt and which is today limited in practice to partial debt relief for just three or four countries."
"The European Union and its Member States can, and must, speak up on this issue, abandoning their limited outlooks, which are full of conditions, which often accompany shamefaced announcements about debt cancellation, and end the aid cuts that have been taking place and which are proposed for the future."
"Instead, they must put forward a broad and resolute plan that will make a decisive contribution to ending a situation of this kind and help to put the development of such important parts of the world into perspective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, initiatives in favour of cancelling all or part of the third world debt are proliferating in the year 2000."
"On this subject, the Cairo Summit did not, any more than other summits, come up with any even remotely clear conclusion."
"This step is, however, a matter of simple common sense, and one is tempted to ask the Council whether they intend one day to refer the matter to their common sense."
"The whole thing verges on the ridiculous."
"Not only do the countries of the south not have the financial resources to pay back their debts but, on top of that, the international economic order, which has foisted a demented concept of liberalism on the world, is preventing the majority of our partners in the south - I am thinking in particular of those in Northern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa - acceding to the conditions for development that is even remotely sustainable."
"Such conditions are continually demolished by the blind application of free trade, accompanied by the obsessive, ideological privatisation of the exploitation of most of their wealth."
"The rich countries, foolishly falling in line with the imperialist rules of the IMF and the World Bank, were nonetheless the first to realise that this cannot damage economic take-off since their own development did not fail on occasion to resort to the rules of protectionism, ensuring, moreover, a privileged place for the state and for public intervention in all its forms."
"Peace between nations can only be achieved if there is balance."
"Political and economic balance are, on the other hand, devastating to a world which is increasingly unipolar."
"As we well know, despite the head-in-the-sand policy practised by rich countries with no thought for the future which takes the world down some highly dangerous roads, and while this House gets bogged down in details and side issues, it is high time that we were able to look at the world as a whole."
"Instead of leaving our only reasonable policy, i.e. the Lomé agreements, high and dry, we ought to be forming genuine economic and, more importantly, political partnerships with the Mediterranean and African countries."
"But, for that, Europe would have to have an authority legitimate and clear-sighted enough to get out of the trap of all-out liberalism and, of course, it has no such authority worthy of the name."
"Mr President, hearing the other speakers, I note that we all agree on the facts."
"The harsh and tragic figures are there for all to see."
"The 50 poorest countries spend twice what they receive in aid in order to pay off their debt."
"An average of 40% of the budget of poor countries is dedicated to debt payments."
"Not only does that undermine their economic development, not only does that significantly reduce their ability to provide basic social services, such as health or education, but it creates a sort of slavery which benefits Western societies."
"In fact two thirds of the debt is generated by interest on earlier loans, loans taken out to pay for the things we sold them, which multinationals sold them."
"This is highly reminiscent of the exploitation of agricultural workers in some countries who are forced to buy from the boss' s shop at inflated prices and who are then forced to work for the rest of their lives for scant wages in order to pay off their debts to this shop."
"What action are we taking to prevent this?"
"The G7 countries announced amid much publicity a debt reduction programme, but conditions are such that it cannot be applied."
"This initiative remains subject to macroeconomic reform programmes under the aegis of the IMF or the World Bank, which run counter to the objectives of eradicating poverty, due to their restrictive effect on the ability to spend on social services and job creation."
"Some major countries have announced that they are going to cancel debts, but this is selective, linked to the interests of certain parties, and is achieved to the detriment of development budgets."
"The indebted countries were expecting a strong message from the Conference between the European Union and Africa held in Cairo recently."
"They were given plenty of fine words, but no practical action."
"What initiatives do the Commission and the Council propose to take at European or international level in order to further relieve or cancel the burden of debt in order to aid the poorest countries?"
"How does the Commission plan to ensure that the appropriations made available by cancelling the debt are properly invested in eradicating poverty and in sustainable development?"
"Finally, what is the Commission' s reaction to the requests presented by some civil society organisations in the countries of the south for improvements in monitoring the macroeconomic adaptation plan, by organising conferences on national development, in order to give public opinion in these countries an opportunity to define national priorities and projects?"
"The Commission's contribution to debt relief can be seen in the HIPC initiative."
"This was launched in September 1996 with the aim of helping to relieve the debt burden of the poorest countries that make adjustment efforts in a concerted way."
"It represents a coordinated effort by all donors including, in particular, multilateral creditors."
"It was the first time ever that the multilateral aspect had been addressed directly."
"In 1999, on the occasion of the G7 Cologne Summit, ministers agreed to an expanded and more flexible initiative that will provide faster, deeper and broader debt relief."
"As a result of the proposed changes, the costs of this HIPC II Initiative are expected to increase significantly to some USD 27.4 billion from a previous estimated level of some USD 13 billion of HIPC I. In fact, the original estimate of the cost of HIPC I was around USD 8 billion only."
"For the record, the Commission has already made a large contribution to HIPC I. The Council adopted, on 6 July 1998, a decision on the Community' s participation in the HIPC Initiative with regard to its claims, special loans and risk capital managed by the European Investment Bank for eligible ACP countries."
"As mentioned before, the Community, as a creditor, is only a small player in this discussion."
"Fortunately, we are mainly a provider of direct grant assistance and not loans."
"We set aside EUR 40 million of interest accumulated on EDF funds which should cover the cost for the first six country cases."
"Community assistance for Uganda and Guyana was delivered in mid-1998 and early 2000, amounting to EUR 4.59 million and EUR 6.44 million respectively."
"The Community has since decided to considerably enhance support for the HIPC II Initiative."
"At the annual meeting in Washington in September 1999, it was announced that the Community' s contribution would be in the order of EUR 1 billion."
"The Commission subsequently submitted draft proposals for decisions to the Joint EU/ACP Council and the EU Council which were adopted by the General Affairs Council on 6 December and by the Joint EU/ACP Council on 8 December."
"It has to be borne in mind that the ACP countries' agreement is required because it is EDF money that is being reallocated so their consent is needed as part of these decisions."
"At present, the Commission is in the process of finalising discussions with its Member States, the European Investment Bank, the World Bank and the African Development Bank about the main principles of the actual implementation of the Community support for the HIPC II Initiative, both as a donor and as a creditor."
"In June, it will present the relevant financing proposals."
"The Community' s global contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund in its capacity as a donor will amount to EUR 680 million for qualifying ACP countries."
"EUR 670 million will be earmarked for the African Development Bank in order to cover its financing gap in the HIPC Initiative and EUR 10 million for the only non-African HIPC ACP country, Guyana."
"The EUR 680 million Community contribution originating from the EDF will be channelled to the HIPC Trust Fund in 3 tranches taking into consideration effective financing needs as well as support from other donors."
"According to the information available, needs for the first tranche this year will be in the order of the magnitude of EUR 250 million."
"The first EC tranche will be paid in July."
"Besides these contributions to be financed from uncommitted EDF funds, a EUR 54 million contribution to the HIPC Trust Fund will also be made towards non-ACP HIPCs drawing on resources from the budgetary lines for Latin America and Asia."
"We want, in other words, to make sure that the EU participation in HIPC is global and in accordance with the figures in HIPC."
"Finally, it must be stressed that the ACP/EU Council decision to reinforce the EC Structural Adjustment Facility by EUR 250 million will partly be used to provide interim relief to eligible HIPC countries belonging to the ACP."
"It is important to stress that the Community contribution to debt relief should not be seen as a substitute for contributions from bilateral donors."
"These are still needed in order to fully finance the initiative announced at the G7 Summit in Cologne."
"The expectation created a year ago was that the G7 countries would come up with additional resources."
"As regards other contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund, it may be worth noting that the draft budget by the US administration suggests a US contribution of USD 600 million which follows on from pledges made earlier and which corresponds to the share of HIPC calculated by the World Bank for the US."
"This draft budget needs to be passed in Congress and this is definitely facing some difficulties. In fact, it seems very doubtful that the US will deliver its share as planned."
"The funds released by the Commission for the HIPC Initiative are subject to the same principles as other funds originating from the European Development Fund and the Commission is carefully involving the EDF Committee, that is Member States, at all stages."
"Article 366(b) of the Lomé Convention in its present form imposes strict conditions on the possible use of EDF money."
"Politically speaking, it would not make sense to stop EDF financed projects in Article 366(b) countries and to provide them with EC quasi direct non-earmarked budget support, for example through HIPC debt relief mechanisms."
"It is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure that EDF money does not facilitate a coup d'état or provide additional budgetary room for manoeuvre to enable dictators to oppress their people."
"It is the very purpose of Article 366(b) in its present form to make things more complicated for countries breaching elementary human rights and good governance principles."
"This view has also been clearly expressed by the European Court of Auditors when commenting on these issues."
"Our hands are somewhat tied in this discussion on how we can accomplish these things in practice."
"In the discussions, which led last year to the agreement on enhancing the HIPC Initiative, there was a strong consensus in the donor community that poverty reduction needs to be re-emphasised as a main focus of development efforts."
"The concept of the poverty reduction strategy papers was launched to provide a framework for mainstreaming poverty reduction in government and donor policies."
"It will require a country-specific approach to assessing a country' s position in development, poverty strategies and institutional capacity."
"The Commission has expressed its strong support for this radically new approach initiated by the World Bank and the IMF."
"Country ownership is paramount for the development of these ideas and governments will have responsibility for both the design process and the final product."
"The Commission attaches particular importance to an open participatory process involving civil society, parliaments and all relevant international institutions and donors."
"Policies that address issues of social justice and equity are as central as economic policy to growth and poverty reduction."
"The Community is maintaining and stepping up its commitment to support macroeconomic reforms, social sectors, regional integration and sound economic management."
"This is all needed in order to make sure that fighting poverty remains the central theme when we are actually improving the situation of these poor countries through the enhanced HIPC Initiative."
"I think that it is quite good that the Commission and the EU in general clearly stand out as the single most important contributor towards making this initiative actually work."
"Mr President, when one hears of the horrendous debt that has built up in many African states, the first reaction is one of deep sympathy."
"However, I have had the privilege of visiting many of these countries in the past year and I have to say that, in many cases, one' s sympathy turns to anger when one sees the abject poverty that people in these countries live in while their leaders and ministers revel in wealth and prosperity and one begins to question the distribution of aid and debt relief."
"Despite all the help given from Europe, individual nation states and institutions, Africa' s external debt is growing by about 12% per annum and some countries are repaying more in interest than they are receiving in aid."
"That cannot be allowed to continue, but neither can the historic reasons for causing it to happen."
"I will be criticised by some honourable Members for saying it, but conditionality must be built into not only development aid but also debt relief."
"I have always maintained that good governance was more important than pure democracy if you are going to stamp out corrupt practices, and if we cannot wipe these practices out we are only pouring good money after bad."
"We must therefore be in a position to monitor the effect of debt relief and make sure that all of it is spent on civil society to give better health, education and employment prospects to the people who are being denied it."
"There is a secondary effect of bad governance and that is the lack of external investment into these countries which denies them the chance of improved prosperity, better employment prospects and a higher standard of living."
"The fight against fraud and corruption should be made a condition for allocating debt relief and development aid - not my words, Mr President, but the words of President Obasanjo of Nigeria in Abuja at the opening of the 13th session of the ACP-EU Assembly."
"If only that could be echoed by every other president in Africa, the resistance to giving debt relief would diminish and some real progress could be made in alleviating the misery and poverty of millions of people."
"Mr President, while we are talking, in Sierra Leone the latest episode in a ten-year long tragedy is taking place. This civil war has been responsible for 50 000 deaths, 2 million refugees and the brutal mutilation of 40 000 men and women of all ages in a systematic campaign of terror."
"Most of Africa is affected by similar tragedies, including the tragedy affecting the Sahrawi people, with which we came face to face this morning just outside here."
"The other side to globalisation is poverty, the indebtedness of the poorer developing countries and the extension of those conflicts which reduce potential for development whilst exacerbating other conflicts and causing fresh poverty."
"This is why the recent EU-Africa Summit held in Cairo was so important."
"It reopened global dialogue with the countries of the African continent and, for the first time, associated the development aid policy with the upholding of democratic principles, rights and the fight against corruption."
"A long-term strategy is essential, and cancelling the debt is the starting point for such a strategy."
"As the resolution tabled by the European Socialist Party states, it is therefore important to increase the percentage of resources set aside by industrialised countries for the poorest countries, but, at the same time, the quality of our undertaking is also crucial."
"The resolution puts forward two major options: new sustainability criteria and greater flexibility for the more indebted countries, and the bilateral cancellation of the debts of the least developed ACP countries."
"These are initial, tangible recommendations, although, in future, we must avoid the repetition of the spiral of debt, with no checks on the choices made."
"Indeed, we are aware that it is not sufficient to cancel the debt if the other mechanisms determining all the policies remain unchanged."
"Cancellation of the debt must be conditional upon the use to which the resources thereby released are put. These resources must be invested in schools, hospitals and the human development of communities, not wasted, as still often occurs today, due to corruption or, what is worse, used to boost the arms trade and support ruinous wars."
"The global economy must be accompanied by a global policy; growth must go hand in hand with the upholding of human and civil rights and the consolidation of democracy."
"In order to avoid the spiral of debt, we therefore need to supplement the means for action: there must be greater cooperation, increased trade exchange, an increase in initiatives to prevent conflicts and more coherent opposition to corrupt, indebted governments which visit upon their citizens the hardship caused by crises and poor development."
"Our commitment to cancelling the debt is a precondition for the introduction of all the policies for reducing poverty."
"Resolution of the debt issue must be accompanied by actions promoting local development."
"In order to succeed, we need to harmonise national policies and supplement them with greater opening up of the markets."
"The recent EU-ACP agreements follow this rationale and provide assistance for the 31 least developed countries over a period of time which should end in 2005."
"In this context, it is essential to involve the private sector in order to boost trade exchange and, in addition to transferring resources, to create the necessary conditions for the growth of an internal market for developing countries, and provide incentives as well as laying down conditions."
"Mr President, there is no point flogging a dead horse."
"This is why the disastrous vicious circle of loans, debts and new loans must be broken."
"The immense repayment costs prevent any form of development."
"There is hardly any money left for education, health care or for building well-functioning government machinery."
"Debt relief is therefore a matter of extreme urgency."
"This should be facilitated in a joint effort involving all creditors, the Union, the States, especially the United States, international institutions and banks."
"However, a very broad strategy will not get us much further."
"The debt cancellation programmes must be tailored to the specific circumstances of each individual country."
"It is essential in this respect to tackle not just the social problems, but also to lay a firm foundation for sustainable economic development."
"If this fails to materialise, then foreign investments will not be forthcoming either."
"A prerequisite for relieving debts is sound financial housekeeping within the governments concerned."
"We should not be naïve about this."
"We can no longer write out blank cheques."
"In the past, billions never reached the intended causes."
"A great deal of money got into the hands of corrupt regimes which allowed Swiss banks to benefit from the large-scale theft of development aid."
"When will the civilised world finally realise that countries which maintain banking secrecy are accessory to huge crimes at the expense of the poorest population groups."
"The IMF and the World Bank started an initiative back in 1996 to relieve the debts of the poorest countries."
"Last summer, the conditions were amended, with good reason."
"Aid was made conditional upon tangible results."
"It would be wonderful if the European Union and the Member States were to take a generous stance if the conditions were met."
"Let us do everything possible to help the poorest countries fight poverty."
"This can work if the victim is involved in his own rescue."
"Mr President, I think we all agree how completely absurd it is that many of the world' s poorest countries sometimes pay more in interest and for debt management than they receive in aid."
"There are at least two questions which I think must be answered."
"The first is: how can the EU and the G7 nations, together with other Western countries, comply with their commitments so that these do not merely become empty promises?"
"In spite of what the Council and the Commission have said, it is, of course, a fact that, notwithstanding the praiseworthy initiative that has been taken, the G7 countries have not so far, unfortunately, taken measures to comply with that initiative."
"All that has happened so far is that the debts of a mere three developing countries have been written off to the tune of 0.25 per cent."
"That is naturally not enough."
"Even those EU countries which have said that they wish to write off the debts have not appropriated funds in their budgets for this purpose."
"On occasions, the funds concerned have been taken from the areas of cooperation and development."
"The most important question of all is: how can it be ensured that the resources are properly used in developing countries?"
"The Council responded by saying that it was not in favour of that kind of control."
"However, the EU, the IMF and the World Bank have, of course, established criteria in other contexts, so why should we not be able to establish criteria to ensure that, for the people, the result of debt cancellation really will be..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are 800 million Africans today and there will be twice as many in 25 years' time, and obviously they are not the only ones to be living in developing countries."
"Many people in Africa are sinking into poverty and increasing numbers of them are immigrating to European countries, which are in the throes of a demographic depression."
"It must be remembered that this poverty coincides with the botched decolonisation of the 1960s which plunged many of these countries into poverty and ethnic conflict, related also to the establishment of dictatorships which were corrupt and, more often than not, it must be acknowledged, Socialist."
"What we would like to say is that cancelling poor countries' debt is no doubt a laudable intention and we are in favour of staggering payments, but we would like to see the root of the trouble being tackled with the same seriousness."
"We may note, for example, that until the 1990s, the African states which were still linked to France by means of economic, monetary and military cooperation agreements represented a haven of stability and relative prosperity."
"The same is true of the states which have maintained links with western powers by means of economic agreements of this type."
"We think this is a more serious solution to the problems of the third world than the outrageous recommendation which the UN made on 4 January to the effect that, in order to offset its falling birth rate, Europe should prepare to accept 159 million immigrants from African countries over the next 25 years."
"Turning Europe into a third-world country is not, we feel, the way to help the third world achieve a genuine degree of economic development."
"The real solution is in Africa in the form of a development policy which enables Africans to live in their own countries, which raises the question of the alleged benefits of free trade."
"Our opinion is that there are no real benefits or, if there are, then only for countries at a comparable economic and social level, and that it is only when protected by secure frontiers and customs rights that these countries will gradually progress from the cottage industry phase to that of industrialisation."
"Mr President, this year is 2000 AD, a jubilee year."
"It is a year in which, based on the concept of the biblical Holy Year, we need to think seriously about relieving the debt of the poorest of the poor."
"In the Holy Year, each fiftieth year, debts were cancelled, slaves released and the land was left fallow in Israel."
"Such a year created the opportunity to start the future with a clean slate."
"In analogy with this biblical reference, the year 2000 should become a Holy Year for the world' s poorest of the poor."
"We therefore welcome national and international initiatives to reduce debts with open arms."
"However, I cannot refrain from making a number of critical remarks in respect of the proud announcements made by a number of G7 countries over the past few years."
"These rich countries boast about the fact that they no longer make a fuss about the gigantic amounts which these poor countries owe them."
"Experiences with the HIPC initiative dating back to 1996, however, have shown that debt reduction has not always had an altogether positive effect on the development of the poor."
"In the best-case scenarios, 100% debt relief only yields an actual 40% reduction in the debt."
"The reason for this is firstly that the conditions tied in with the debt relief are such that only few countries qualify."
"Moreover, room for debt relief is often found in national and international budgets for development policy."
"As such, it is not a matter of making available additional financial resources but more a matter of shifting funds."
"Poor countries may spend less on repaying their debts, but they also have to cope with a drop in foreign aid."
"If we really want to take the fight against world poverty seriously, debt reduction should be accompanied by an active policy to combat poverty."
"In this respect, it is desirable to deploy local governments and NGOs."
"These minor observations, however, do not detract from the fact that concessions made must be met and new initiatives have to be launched."
"A careful and generous stance is a welcome bonus in this respect."
"The Commission, Member States and international donors must make every effort to turn the year of Our Lord 2000 into a Holy Year in the true sense of the word."
"Mr President, fine words have been spoken about cancelling the enormous debts of a large number of developing countries to mark the millennium, as Mr Van Dam mentioned a moment ago. These speeches were given at the G7 meeting, at the European Summit in Lisbon and at the recent Euro-African Summit in Cairo."
"The question we are left with today is: what will come of this?"
"We have heard a few examples from the HIPC-I and HIPC-II programmes and I understand that 1 billion is tied up in this second programme."
"The total debt burden of all developing countries comes to 350 billion."
"This means that, in comparison, this 1 billion is really peanuts."
"Many of those countries pay 25% to 40% of their national budget on interest and repayment into banks in Western Europe, the United States and Japan."
"The harsh reality is that the billions which are paid to repay debts far exceed the development aid."
"That is a disastrous situation because we often ask ourselves why our development aid does not work."
"Well, here is one of the most important reasons."
"If a sum of money comes in and subsequently a sum has to be repaid which is three or four times the original amount, then those countries will not make any headway, of course."
"One question which remains is: should you cancel debts unconditionally?"
"I do not share the view of Mr Miranda or other MEPs who think one should."
"In my opinion, conditions should very much be part of the deal."
"The countries involved should be the poorest ones, to start with."
"They should have a democratic government and a pluriform parliament which keeps the government in check."
"The country must fight corruption actively."
"The countries concerned should not be at war or participate in wars, and an agreed proportion of the budget must really be spent on social schemes for the poorest citizens, and must be invested in education, health care and social security."
"I do not agree with Mr Da Costa who said a moment ago that this might be somewhat neo-colonial."
"It was even agreed in Copenhagen, at the Social Summit for developing countries which was held there a while ago, that a proportion was to be spent on those costs."
"Mr President, we should really call for something to be done about this."
"We should simply spend 10% of the total development budget on cancelling these debts."
"If we do nothing, the countries will remain trapped in a downward spiral."
"Mr President, I have listened with interest to both the Council and the Commission."
"The Socialist Group considers that the debt which blights the development of the world' s poorest countries cannot be dealt with in isolation, as a purely financial problem, but it must be dealt with within the framework of a broad and coherent strategy which, through the eradication of poverty, leads to development."
"To this end, firstly, the cancellation of debt must not involve the removal of other sources of finance, but cancellation must be one more measure in a coherent development policy."
"Secondly, the funds made available through the cancellation of debt must be used for human development funds, particularly for investment in health and education."
"I do not agree with the Council when it says that this may mean a new form of colonisation."
"I do not believe that to be the case."
"In order to be effective, in development terms, the cancellation of debt also requires, as we request in the resolution, a global strategy implemented in unison in and by the international financial institutions."
"The European Union, as a major contributor of development aid, must coordinate its action in this regard and make the elimination of poverty the common objective of its Member States, one aspect of this being the cancellation of debt in the poorest countries."
"This is therefore an example of the need for coherence and coordination between Community policies."
"The common foreign and security policy, which we too often treat as just a security policy, must address this issue as well as commercial and development policies."
"The highly-indebted poor countries, who are the beneficiaries of this debt cancellation strategy that has already been adopted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, must commit themselves to suitable macroeconomic policies, to social development objectives, to increase the credibility of the state, which is the only way to attract foreign investment, and to strengthen their institutional capacity."
"By uniting the actions of debtors and creditors in a global strategy aimed at the elimination of poverty, it is possible that we will achieve objective 15 of the Copenhagen Summit on social development, which is an objective which we fully identify with."
"We therefore strongly urge all Member States and the Commission to support the international financial institutions' HIPC initiative for highly indebted poor countries."
"Mr President, it is commendable that the international community is apparently serious about reducing debt."
"Unfortunately, this inspired policy comes too late, far too late."
"As early as the late eighties, UNICEF stated that the rich obtained the loans in the Third World and the poor were saddled with the debts, and UNICEF was right."
"According to Oxfam, there are 19 000 children who die daily in the developing countries as a result of the debt burden and as an indirect result, admittedly, of the IMF programmes which require certain countries to cut down their health care expenditure by one third."
"Is it not mind-boggling that countries sometimes have to spend up to 40% of their budget on paying off debts, which have often been accumulated by irresponsible and avaricious dictators, with the unspoken collaboration of the World Bank and private western banks?"
"Let us learn from past experience."
"I am in favour of debt reduction but not on a level repayment or unconditional basis."
"It should feature as part of an integrated and multi-lateral strategy."
"It must be accompanied by proper management requirements."
"These requirements must be followed by hard guarantees from the countries involved: guarantees that the funding made available by cancelling debts is used to fight poverty; guarantees that the funding will no longer be used to finance arms deals and other military activities."
"Mr Da Costa, that is not neo-colonialism in my book."
"It is making sure that the funds of the European taxpayer are not misused to fund wars - crazy wars - in Africa. Conditionality requires courage and - you will have to forgive me - more courage than the Member States and the Commission have displayed so far."
"Mr President, as others have said, many promises have been made on debt relief but in fact very few have been delivered."
"After all the headlines that we heard at Cologne last year, less than $13 billion of the $100 billion promised has actually been cancelled and as the Commission and the Council have told us, contributions to the HIPC Trust Fund are still way below target."
"As the Commissioner rightly says, the burden deserves to be shared."
"The fact is that despite a $1 trillion budget surplus over 10 years, President Clinton is not able to squeeze $210 million for HIPC out of Congress."
"That is an appalling fact for us to take on board."
"It is also the case that we are still waiting for the World Bank and the IMF to come up with something similar to the European Union."
"All G7 countries have promised some form of 100% debt cancellation, but many of them are very slow and disinclined to do it in the way that we would like."
"Also, to qualify for debt relief, each country has to complete a long and often contradictory 'HIPC' process, and only 5 countries have so far managed to go through the hoops that they are being asked to go through."
"So far, the United Kingdom is the only country that has offered 100% debt cancellation."
"France, Germany and Japan only include pre-cut-off debts and so ignore a significant portion of debt."
"Japan, incidentally, ties its debt relief to responsibility to buy Japanese exports."
"On Mozambique, for instance, it is very significant that the IMF, the World Bank and the Paris Club only postponed payments from Mozambique and then actually lent more money."
"So, what I would say, finally, is that we in this Parliament urge all the creditors to stop delaying and to start working really hard towards fulfilling full debt cancellation for the poorest countries."
"Of course, I agree with all my colleagues, the poorest countries who fulfil the criteria of delivering debt relief to those countries that show a commitment to social sector and human development support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that it has become quite clear today that the situation referred to in the question is of great concern and has attracted the Council' s attention."
"This is essentially an issue on which there is a degree of agreement, particularly within the European Union."
"The Portuguese Presidency of the European Union has furthermore taken care to include this issue in its working programme and has ensured that it was a key part of the agenda of the Cairo Euro-African summit."
"This issue must, however, be considered calmly and carefully, without any histrionics, given the serious situation that the populations of the highly indebted countries find themselves in."
"The fundamental issue of debt is not the central issue for these countries - the main issue is their development, and this is the key point behind all this."
"We must all be aware that what is currently at stake is the global debate on general development policy and, in particular, on the role of the European Union and its Member States in defining this policy at world level."
"This is the crucial issue: debt is a symptom but underdevelopment is the disease."
"There are indeed problems of inequality and of the uneven distribution of wealth in these countries, but these problems must be overcome through political solutions."
"I spoke just now about the temptation or tendency to adopt a neo-colonial approach, but I was by no means implying that some aid conditions - a subject which is in fact influenced by the current philosophy behind ACP-EU cooperation - are not perfectly legitimate and acceptable."
"What we must not forget is that there is a code of conduct for the internal management of resource allocation, and in particular for resources released for these countries as debt relief."
"We must be reasonably careful to find a way to respect the right of these countries' governments to manage these funds."
"We must understand that we have to endeavour to ensure that political conditionality and the strengthening of democracy in these countries are the key factors underpinning our action."
"Working towards good governance and working towards strengthening democratic structures and political participation are vital factors in creating free societies which provide for better management of internal resources and more appropriate management of wealth distribution and, in particular, which do not encourage corruption and the siphoning-off of funds."
"It is our opinion that these issues are fundamentally linked to development. As I said, the issue of debt is a symptom of a much more global issue, namely development."
"I think that the European Union and the Member States have demonstrated that they are mindful of the problems in this field and that they have concrete measures to propose in order to address them."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by commenting on the necessity of conditionality."
"I agree with a number of the contributions here."
"I would also say that what we are facing here is not a tighter regime of conditionality than what Member States are actually pursuing in their bilateral development cooperation, as nowadays it is necessary to ensure that the use of resources corresponds to the goals that are set."
"If we look at the substance, it is also the link to focusing better on social aspects in the HIPC countries - that is the key to what they have to do."
"There is also evidence of this being taken up by the World Bank and the IMF, with those institutions coming on board in terms of giving priority to these aspects."
"In a way, one could say that we are witnessing a move from the Washington consensus to the Copenhagen consensus."
"The good part of this is that the IMF, with the poverty reduction strategy papers, is aligning itself with the goals the World Bank set a few years ago."
"All this shows that the fight against poverty is at the centre of this effort."
"So the combination of keeping the focus on perhaps narrowly defined HIPC countries and looking at the social consequences inside those countries is quite reasonable."
"I turn to the matter of whether too few countries are part of the initiative."
"It would be wrong to think that we could simply broaden its scope and welcome all developing countries to it."
"There would be a number of adverse effects if we did so."
"Firstly, the cost of the HIPC initiative would increase dramatically because the wealthier these countries are, or the less poor, the bigger the debt they have acquired."
"So it must be borne in mind that this has to do with helping the poorest countries to determine those areas in which they can manage the remaining debt."
"The idea was never to cancel all debt from the Third World countries because that was totally impracticable."
"We are at a level of 0.22% or 0.23% for official development assistance, far from the 0.7% target that in principle everybody has agreed to and which only a limited number of countries have actually reached."
"The 350bn would not be a manageable figure, and also the value for the poorest countries would be watered down if it were shared amongst the less poor middle-income countries."
"I would say to Mrs Schörling that almost all money for HIPC is found from the existing development budgets."
"This is also the case for the billion of EDF money we are reallocating."
"The nice thing about it is that the ACP countries accepted it, and this is a reallocation that moves money from the relatively better-off to the poorest countries in the ACP group."
"So we are doing something very concrete by improving the poverty focus of our general activity in this reallocation."
"That part of it is highly welcome."
"The good thing is that we had the money so we were able to do something of real value as the only donor around, except for a few elite donors who are trying to shame the rest by moving forward and setting a good example - the usual gang."
"Otherwise, the European Union is the only one able to do something of real value."
"Finally, I welcome very much the way this debate has gone."
"Parliament's interest is an important asset for the European Union."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I have received five motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Situation in Zimbabwe"
"The next item is the statements by the Commission and the Council on the situation in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present pre-election campaign period in Zimbabwe continues to be marked by a climate of intimidation towards the opposition and a lack of respect for the law and for citizens' rights, sometimes with tragic consequences."
"The situation has been growing worse despite considerable international efforts, particularly by the European Union, to persuade President Mugabe to order the so-called 'veterans' to leave the farmers' properties that they have invaded immediately, so as to guarantee the safety of all citizens, and in particular foreign nationals resident in Zimbabwe."
"The European Union is deeply concerned at the situation in Zimbabwe and the Council has published two Presidency statements, on 13 March and on 7 May, in which it expressed its grave concern at the situation."
"All of the European Union' s candidate countries, as well as the countries of the European Economic Area, have given their backing to these statements."
"Various meetings have also been held with the government of Zimbabwe, at the Council' s initiative."
"As for the fundamental issue behind the current crisis - land - the European Union has continued to state its willingness to help Zimbabwe to implement a redistribution of farmland which is compatible with respect for property rights and, in particular, with the principles and conclusions of the Donors Conference on Land Reform and Resettlement in Zimbabwe, held in Harare in 1998."
"With regard to the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe, which have been set for 24 and 25 June, it is more vital than ever for them to be held in a free, fair and transparent way and within the deadline that has been set."
"International observers should be present at these elections so that they can observe how the elections proceed and vouch for the final result of the vote and for the legitimacy that the elections need, and guarantee that the result is accepted by the international community."
"To this end, the European Union is prepared to send a mission of election observers, but must, of course, warn the Zimbabwean authorities of the need for satisfactory guarantees that the observers will be safe and that they will have freedom of access to all relevant premises."
"The Troika of European Union Heads of Mission in Harare will personally convey this message to the Zimbabwean authorities."
"The Commission representatives will travel there on Friday 19 May to prepare for the mission of election observers in order to verify that the appropriate conditions have been met."
"Next Monday, the General Affairs Council will consider the Commission representatives' report on their visit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that Zimbabwe is a partner of the European Union under the Lomé Convention, and that Zimbabwe must respect the principles enshrined in that convention, which form the basis of the European Union's cooperation policy."
"The European Union will continue to follow developments in that country in the light of these principles and will not fail to draw the necessary conclusions in the event that these principles are not adhered to."
"The Commission is concerned about the evolving situation in Zimbabwe."
"Zimbabwe, for decades a stable country, is now going through an increasingly severe economic and political crisis."
"Parliamentary elections have now been announced by the government for 24 and 25 June."
"This is a good sign."
"The pursuance of illegal farm occupations, continued violence, death, injuring and intimidation of the opposition are being interpreted as part of the ruling party' s electoral campaign."
"Recent weeks have witnessed a series of international initiatives to facilitate the holding of free and fair elections."
"The General Affairs Council of 10 April urged the government of Zimbabwe to create the conditions to hold free and fair elections."
"The Commission continues to urge the government of Zimbabwe to hold elections, free of intimidation."
"I had a very direct conversation with President Mugabe at the EU-Africa Summit."
"I followed this up with a letter to him this week."
"Following the EU Member States' agreement in the Azores on 6 and 7 May, the Commission this week has a mission in Zimbabwe to look at necessary arrangements for an EU observer team and to coordinate with other election observation initiatives by SADC, the Commonwealth and the US."
"The Commission has already provided EUR 220 000 for the training of 1 440 Zimbabwean election observers and has made available another EUR 6 million to support initiatives from civil society, including on good governance and democratisation."
"The Commission electoral assessment mission now in Zimbabwe is discussing with Member States arrangements to deal with the logistical and operational aspects of this exercise, in particular, funding, freedom of movement and security of service."
"EU observers are not being sent to legitimise an electoral process so far marked by intimidation and violence."
"However, international observers could play an important role in deterring violence and building confidence, especially in the rural areas."
"A preliminary EU proposal currently being developed would see the deployment of 150 observers, 100 of whom would be deployed in the first week of June to observe the electoral campaign and the rest to augment the EU' s observation of the vote and the count."
"Consultations with the government, coordination with other international observer missions, such as the Commonwealth, US and Norway, and with local observation initiatives are on-going."
"Acknowledging the long experience of the European Parliament in election observation, we invite representatives to participate."
"With respect to development cooperation, the Commission is maintaining its European Development Fund poverty alleviation aid directed through the social sectors of health, education and rural development and, in particular, to combat the HIV/Aids epidemic."
"These poverty alleviation programmes facilitate the pursuance of dialogue with civil society and provide an appropriate political signal."
"The international community, while condemning certain governmental actions, still supports the people of Zimbabwe."
"Given the government' s poor macroeconomic performance, the EU, like the IMF and the World Bank, has already frozen structural adjustment support."
"On the question of the possible suspension of Zimbabwe's privileges under the Lomé Convention, there could be grounds for suspension if the Commission considers, after consulting thoroughly with Member States, that this would not be counterproductive at this stage before the elections."
"We fear it would be manipulated and interpreted as a collective reaction orchestrated by what are polemically called 'former colonial powers' against Zimbabwe and its government."
"In the worst scenario, if respect for the rule of law further deteriorates or if the elections were to be flawed, the Commission would have to consider whether Zimbabwe merits the privileges accorded under the Lomé Convention."
"Suspension of these privileges would be economically crippling for Zimbabwe and would aggravate the crisis."
"But so far I believe we have followed the right course."
"Mr President, I suppose I can start on a note of slight optimism in that President Mugabe has now named the days for the election as 24 and 25 June."
"But on the down side, he is increasing all the army and civil servants' pay as a straight bribe."
"I sincerely hope that Members of this Parliament will have the chance to act as observers, as these elections must be seen to have been free, fair and transparent in the atmosphere of fear that President Mugabe has created."
"Only last month we passed a resolution in this Chamber condemning violence, calling for the return to full democracy and for free and fair elections to be held."
"Some of these demands have now hopefully been implemented, but not before another white farmer had been murdered."
"We all accept that there must be a redistribution of the best land in Zimbabwe, but this must be done through round table negotiations, and not with the violent acts we have seen over the last few months."
"President Mugabe has now set up a committee of white farmers and Mugabe supporters, hopefully to reach a sensible agreement on land redistribution."
"President Mugabe should never forget the economic damage that will be done to Zimbabwe' s economy if land redistribution simply means the land goes back to subsistence farming in small blocks."
"There are few people in the rabble we have seen invading farms who could afford the employees, the machinery, seeds and fertilisers to farm these units to give a potential export output."
"I have seen some of the farms that were reclaimed some years ago by Mr Mugabe and most of the fertile productive land has reverted to bush and the buildings and farmhouses are now crumbling ruins."
"What a waste in a country dependent on agricultural exports!"
"Over the last few years, there has been a move to persuade political leaders in African regions to carry more responsibility for conflict prevention."
"It was, therefore, gratifying to hear Nelson Mandela criticising the policies of the Zimbabwe president who is destroying his country."
"I am sorry that President Mbeki, his successor, who is probably the most powerful leader in Africa, has not in public condemned the violence in Zimbabwe."
"We in Parliament are right to call on the Commission to review its development cooperation with Zimbabwe if transparent elections are not held or if the opposition wins and the violence continues."
"The use of Article 366 should be considered."
"The World Bank has now cut funding because of debt arrears and Zimbabwe, as a country, is in liquidation."
"We can but live and hope that a peaceful conclusion can be reached in Zimbabwe as it is the people themselves who are suffering most in this unstable situation the country finds itself in."
"I have to say at the outset that I am extremely encouraged by the fact that the Commission has worked out such a very clear strategy for dealing with these very critical weeks before the election takes place."
"I particularly welcome the fact that we are training domestic observers - I think that is very important and will offset the likelihood of Mugabe criticising us for coming in in a neo-colonialist way to interfere in his election."
"I also welcome the fact that we will be supporting civil society' s objectives in these next few weeks."
"I very much hope, Commissioner, that we will disseminate this kind of information in Zimbabwe because those people trying to mount an opposition campaign will be heartened by the kind of information that we have had from you today and I think that would be important."
"One of the things I want to talk about briefly is the role of the state-controlled media in the run-up before the election."
"The Commissioner did not mention this, but it would be sensible to do so because TV, radio and state-owned newspapers in Zimbabwe are acting now as if they were the agents of Zanu-PF."
"All reporting of opposition parties is negative, with the MDC a particular target."
"I would really like to know what we can do from the European Union to try to ensure that the opposition groups - and there are 26 parties standing in the election - have some access to the media."
"State-controlled media, Commissioner, is refusing to take paid advertising even from the main NGOs who are just working to support the electoral process and democracy in Zimbabwe, or from any opposition parties."
"Only three independent newspapers are carrying any kind of adverts from parties other than Zanu-PF so that only the claims of the government are being read or seen by the people and that has to be a contradiction if we are talking about providing democracy."
"The fact is that the independent press does not have the print capacity to deal with demand."
"People in Zimbabwe are afraid."
"The deaths and injuries in the rural areas and increasingly in the towns are deeply worrying."
"Zanu-PF has the government resources, and the MDC supporters are too afraid to donate money."
"I even read in the British press that Kabila and Qadhafi are giving money now to Mugabe' s campaign, which is a bit frightening."
"It is deeply worrying that the opposition are fighting their campaign on Zanu-PF grounds."
"They have no control over the electoral roll, they have no control over the polling stations that will be run by government civil servants."
"This is wrong because the role of these government civil servants in the last referendum was very dubious indeed."
"The people understand that and are aware of it."
"There is evidence also of this Fifth Brigade being involved in pre-election crackdowns."
"The Fifth Brigade were responsible for the brutality that Mugabe perpetuated in Matabeleland in the 80s."
"That also is something that worries me and I would like the EU to look into it."
"Finally, President, let us be sure that we work as a European Union to create the conditions which will allow the people of Zimbabwe to express their choices in this election in June and express their choices in secret and without fear."
"Mr President, why have so many African freedom fighters who we admired so much ended up as power-crazed potentates?"
"Why have so few former colonies turned into constitutional states?"
"Where anarchy and lawlessness rule, the law of the most brutal party applies."
"In Zimbabwe, this takes the form of Mr Mugabe."
"Where this country used to be a model for the Third World of how things should be done, it has now degenerated into its own opposite."
"It is ruled by a dictator who deems his own power and privileges more important than the lack of stability of his country and the suffering of his own people."
"Land reform is necessary, of course."
"The possession of land in Zimbabwe still reflects the old colonial relations and this will, needless to say, cause tension."
"But for years, Mr Mugabe himself had the opportunity to carry out this land reform, even with foreign help."
"The question is therefore: what mala fide reasons are behind Mr Mugabe' s doing nothing initially and then, just before the elections, getting his cronies to cause havoc in the farms of the white people?"
"According to the Zimbabwean election monitors, the incessant violence renders free and fair elections impossible."
"As long as this is the case, the election date has to be postponed."
"A situation whereby Mr Mugabe legitimises his position through violence and intimidation must be avoided at all costs."
"It would be a positive step if MEPs acted as observers during these elections and included Mugabe' s pre-electoral machinery in their assessment."
"If the elections are not conducted fairly, European aid will need to be postponed."
"But the cooperation according to Lomé cannot continue if Mugabe also renders elections impossible."
"A further deterioration of the situation in Zimbabwe could have far-reaching effects on the African continent in general, and on South Africa in particular."
"The Zimbabwean population deserves a far better government than it has at the moment."
"It is high time that the European Union spoke very clear language."
"Our patience with African leaders whose heroic deeds only take the form of abuse of power is running out."
"Mr President, I too would like to start by welcoming the Commission' s strategy for the run-up to the election that has just been set out by the Commissioner and, in particular, the training of the Zimbabwean election monitors."
"The black people of Zimbabwe are still suffering under the legacy of colonialism."
"Cecil Rhodes, one of Britain's most successful colonists, said the purpose of colonialism was: ""To find new lands in which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap labour that is available from the natives of the colonies"" ."
"The legacy of this barbarically successful strategy can be seen in the chaos that is happening in Zimbabwe today."
"Today, just 4 000 white farmers still own over 70% of the arable land while more than seven million black Zimbabweans scratch a living from overcrowded communal areas."
"We condemn the violence but we also see that black Zimbabweans have a compelling case."
"This makes President Mugabe' s refusal to proceed with the lawful land redistribution programme even more deplorable."
"It is a fearsomely difficult problem when Mugabe will not negotiate."
"But I call on the UK Government to do all they can to persuade Zimbabwe to set up an independent arbitration board fully representative of the landless people and, once it is set up, perhaps with the assistance of the Commonwealth, to resume financial aid as soon as possible."
"The British Government must recognise the moral debt owed for crimes of slavery and colonialism and continue to do all in its power to support a peaceful and progressive settlement to the land issues in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, the story of Zimbabwe is one of hope turning to despair - hope that in 1980 Zimbabwe could have realised its full potential and become a leading country in Africa; despair now because the father of the nation has reduced his creation from being one of the richest and most educated of African countries to being one of the poorest."
"It is a truly remarkable achievement and a case study of mismanagement in recent history."
"I am sure Mr Mugabe' s place in history books is now secured for all the wrong reasons."
"Today the country is suffering from 50% unemployment and 60% inflation; he is spending USD 1 million a day on a foreign adventure in the Congo; the foreign exchange reserves have gone and the World Bank has suspended funding on projects."
"I was astonished to hear the speech just given by my colleague from the Greens."
"Yet out of despair comes resolution, determination and hope."
"The country is one of the most educated in Africa and the European Union should be proud of its role in helping to set up that educational support structure in the past 20 years."
"It has a functioning civic institution and culture."
"Elections are due and voter rolls are being prepared but those voter rolls must be verified before the election."
"The opposition parties want more transparency."
"Twenty people have been killed and more than 1 200 farms illegally occupied."
"Mr Mugabe has lost control of the country, presiding over lawlessness and corruption."
"On 24 June elections are going to be held."
"Yesterday, the Commonwealth Secretary-General said that it is still possible to have free elections."
"The future of the country lies with the young people of Zimbabwe."
"They demand the elections."
"They must be given a chance."
"It is their future."
"One thing we must do is to change the culture that is prevalent in Africa today that the winner takes all."
"We must stop this winner-takes-all culture that every African country has, and I mean every country."
"We must be seen to have free and fair elections and to demonstrate that they have been fair and free."
"Mr President, the view shared by virtually all speakers is that the only ray of hope at the moment in Zimbabwe' s anarchy is the fact that elections will be held soon."
"I agree with all speakers who said that we need to ensure that those elections are held as fairly as possible, which will not be easy."
"I found the words of Commissioner Nielson encouraging when he said that, as early as the beginning of July, observers will be sent to Zimbabwe."
"I think that this is vital because those who are not kindly disposed towards the Mugabe regime, those in opposition, will clearly need protection."
"I would therefore like to back up the Commission in this opinion."
"Observers need to be sent to Zimbabwe at the earliest opportunity, today if possible, rather than tomorrow."
"Another worrying development is the reaction of the neighbouring countries."
"From Europe, we have fought for years to establish racial equality, equal opportunities, democracy, etc. in Southern Africa."
"At the moment, there is a deadly silence in the neighbouring countries which, in my opinion, is a very ominous development."
"I therefore hold the view that, if the elections in Zimbabwe were not fair, for whatever reason, the Commission should continue with the course it set a moment ago."
"If there are clear signs of large-scale fraud and Mugabe remains in power illegally, then, according to the provisions of the Lomé Convention, aid must be halted."
"If the Commission were not to do this, the illegal dispossessions of land could spread to the rest of Southern Africa and this would be a disaster, not only for the area concerned, but also for the rest of Africa."
"We must avoid this at all costs."
"Mr President, I want to address the President of free Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, personally, together with his government and socialist-oriented party, Zanu-PF."
"Hatred, President Mugabe, is not something upon which a society can be built."
"Threats can never create confidence and social harmony."
"Lawlessness can never create security and human solidarity."
"Violence and murder can never be reconciled with the Christian view of human beings which I know that you, President Mugabe, have grown up with and embraced."
"The churches of Zimbabwe, the Lutheran World Federation and the World Council of Churches appeal to your conscience."
"My home country of Sweden has supported Zimbabwe very persistently and in very concrete ways, both in developing its economy and in its struggle to be a free and democratic country founded upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of human life, irrespective of the colour of a person' s skin."
"Since independence in 1980, Sweden has provided a total of SEK 2 billion in aid, corresponding to USD 220 million."
"Twenty years ago, the Church of Sweden' s youth movement, which I myself was active in, embarked upon a special venture which we called 'Be a Friend of Zimbabwe' ."
"Enthusiastic young people from our two countries met."
"We believed in you, President Mugabe, and in your country' s future because you wanted to uphold the Christian view of human beings in Zimbabwe."
"We want to believe in you again, even though a lot of bad things have happened."
"Put away hatred."
"Do it for the sake of your own reputation, both now and in the future."
"Do it for the sake of Zimbabwe' s citizens, and do it for the sake of Africa."
"First in answer to Mrs Kinnock - we are indeed in close contact with civil society."
"Civil society represents a hope of achieving a civilised society."
"But there is some way to go right now."
"We are also in direct contact with the opposition."
"We make a point of getting in contact with all players in a very visible and clear way."
"We are urging the Mugabe government to accept that pluralism must be there to stay, and this is also the point of sending in the observers."
"I hope we can solve the problems of funding of the observer mission."
"I have to tell Parliament that this once again demonstrates the inadequacy of our system."
"We cannot just push a button somewhere in our system and the funds appear."
"It is highly complicated to find the money for this in time."
"This is the kind of system we have."
"Yesterday' s discussion about the external relations reform is even today relevant."
"At least we have excellent coordination on the ground in Zimbabwe with the Member States, which is very helpful."
"Let me finally explain to you what we are doing on the ground even in this situation."
"We are deciding on a EUR 19 million grant for very targeted poverty alleviation in Zimbabwe via a microproject scheme, part of which will be used to support resettlement of the poorest people on legally acquired land."
"This will demonstrate in practice how land should be redistributed - in marked contrast to what is going on in Zimbabwe right now."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0220/2000). We will examine questions to the Council."
"I would like to remind you that we are 20 minutes behind schedule."
"It is not possible to extend work beyond 7.00 p.m. because the representative of the Council has an official meeting at 7.05 p.m. with the Parliamentary contact group to discuss the statute of the MEPs."
"That is very important work, it is already scheduled and we must work as quickly as possible so that the maximum number of questions can be answered."
"The rest will be replied to in writing."
"We will begin Question Time."
"Question No 1 by (H-0350/00):"
"Subject: Undesirable persons in Turkey The Turkish newspaper 'Sabah' has published a list of 56 persons considered undesirable in Turkey."
"The list includes numerous political representatives from several European Union countries (Denmark, Italy, Greece, Sweden and Spain) and also from non-Member States, together with a large number of journalists, clergymen, members of humanitarian organisations etc. Despite the uproar caused by this list, the Turkish Government has not denied its existence."
"As maintaining a list of undesirable persons constitutes an unacceptable and undemocratic act on the part of the Turkish Government, does the Council intend to look into the issue and to intervene with the Turkish Government at once to ask for the list to be scrapped?"
"Mr President, I shall try to answer the questions as briefly as possible, although the brevity of my answers does not reflect the Council' s genuine desire to give answers to this House that are as comprehensive as possible."
"It is indeed true that information has appeared in a Turkish newspaper about a list of people considered to be undesirable in Turkey."
"This issue was specifically raised by the Presidency at the Association Council meeting between the European Union and Turkey on 11 April 2000. I would like to say that the Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr Schem, has stated officially that no such list exists, which is why, in the light of an official statement like this, we feel that we should not continue to insist on this point."
"If, by any chance, the Turkish authorities were to take any action that might suggest a contradiction of what the Turkish Foreign Minister has told us, the Council would, of course, act accordingly."
"- (EL) I should like to thank the President-in-Office, both because the question was raised and for his reply."
"I hope that this is in fact the case."
"I should like to use the opportunity which I have to ask a second supplementary question and the occasion of the presence here of the husband and son of Leila Zana, who was awarded the European Parliament' s Sakharov prize, to ask the minister the following question: does he not think that before assuming the Portuguese Presidency, he should have raised the matter of the release of a lady member of parliament honoured by our very own House with the Sakharov prize for her fight for human rights now that Turkey wishes to draw closer to, and integrate into, the European Union?"
"Should the Council and the presidency not have made a move to help Leila Zana?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the decisions of the Helsinki European Council led to Turkey being considered as a candidate for accession to the European Union."
"It was agreed that, following this decision, an accession strategy would be established, which naturally includes strict monitoring of what the European Union regards as essential reforms. This relates in particular to the area of human rights, which, in the light of the Copenhagen criteria, are essential for the accession of any country to the European Union."
"The Council will monitor all of these issues and will not fail, whenever necessary, to convey any information to this House which is relevant to progress with this accession strategy and, in particular, its views on Turkey' s compliance with requirements for the future opening of accession negotiations by the European Union."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I attend Question Time nearly every time and every time the first question or two are from our colleagues in the Greek Communists and, in particular, Mr Alavanos."
"You will notice that the date on this question is 30 March 2000, which was two weeks before the last part-session."
"Therefore, in my view, it should not have been number one on the list but should have been on the last part-session' s list of questions."
"There seems to be some system whereby Mr Alavanos and his colleagues always get the first and second questions, and they always attack Turkey."
"I should like you to investigate why this should be."
"Mr Purvis, I believe that we should not enter into any judgement of intentions."
"I would like to point out - although you already know - that the President, together with her office, decides on the order of questions."
"I do not know whether Mr Alavanos has so much influence with the Presidency of Parliament."
"What I can tell you is that it is not the Greek Communist Party but Synaspismos."
"That I do know about."
"However, we shall continue with our agenda."
"I will take good note of your question."
"Question No 2 by (H-0361/00):"
"Subject: Dispute between Armenia and Turkey On 11 December 1999 the Council accepted Turkey' s application for accession to the European Union."
"Paragraph 3 of Parliament' s resolution of 18 June 1987 'Calls on the Council to obtain from the present Turkish Government an acknowledgement of the genocide perpetrated against the Armenians in 1915-1917 and to promote the establishment of a dialogue between Turkey and the representatives of the Armenians' ."
"Turkey has not acknowledged the genocide in question and is still imposing its economic blockade on Armenia."
"What action has the Council taken to encourage the development of political relations between Armenia and Turkey?"
"Is the Council considering lifting the embargo as one of the indispensable conditions for Turkey' s accession to the European Union?"
"Mr President, I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his answer."
"I must, however, regretfully inform him that his answer was still particularly vague, as my question referred to a European Parliament resolution adopted in 1987, in which, effectively, we officially recognised events such as the genocide of the Armenians between 1915 and 1917."
"We do not, however, know today what measures have been taken by successive Councils in order to attempt to establish relations between both these countries, given that today Turkey is still imposing an economic blockade on Armenia."
"My question is therefore as follows: in the context of negotiations with a view to Turkey' s accession to the European Union, has the issue of this blockade been raised, and could lifting this blockade be counted a precondition to Turkey' s accession?"
"The honourable Member has asked two questions."
"The first concerns the 1987 resolution on acknowledging the genocide in 1915-1917 and the second question basically concerns political relations between Armenia and Turkey."
"With regard to the first question, these issues are obviously open to political interpretation, although they are based on a historical assumption which we all acknowledge and which is extremely important, but which is not a precondition for reopening dialogue with Turkey."
"With regard to relations between Armenia and Turkey, which we hope will be positive in future, all that the European Union has done is to try to ensure that Turkey complies with the European Union' s normal framework of external relations. This framework includes good relations with Armenia, especially on trade matters."
"These good relations and the whole framework for cooperation on which they are based are part of the acquis communautaire that Turkey must accept."
"Nevertheless, at international level, we cannot force countries to maintain good relations with one another, as these cannot be imposed by decree. They must result from a political decision."
"Turkey must practically demonstrate that no matter how it views the situation in Armenia, if it wishes to open negotiations with the European Union and if it wishes to join the European Union, it will, of course, have to respect the whole framework of good relations that the European Union enjoys with Armenia."
"This has, until now, been a purely bilateral issue and the European Union cannot, therefore, intervene in it."
"Question No 3 by (H-0365/00):"
"Subject: EU-Jordan Association Agreement Would the Council please list those Member States which have still to ratify the EU-Jordan Association Agreement and advise what level of priority it is giving to encouraging them to speed up the process?"
"Mr President, in reply to this question, I think that in terms of day-to-day relations between the Council and the European Parliament, it would be useful if we could make full use of the facilities that the transparency process for Council information provides for all citizens, including Members of the European Parliament."
"That is why I would like to suggest that those honourable Members who are interested in issues such as this should use the Council web page, which is updated daily, to ascertain the dates of signing and the position on ratification, adoption and entry into force of all agreements, and specifically the Mediterranean agreements such as the agreement with Jordan to which the honourable Member' s question refers."
"On this point, the latest information I have is that eight countries have still not ratified the EU-Jordan Association Agreement."
"As you will be aware, this is a matter for national parliaments, and they have the final say, as these are mixed agreements, in which there is a Community dimension and a national dimension."
"It is obvious that we cannot interfere in the decisions of national parliaments."
"Nevertheless, we can and we must make representations to the governments of these countries, and I must say that the Portuguese Presidency intends, at the next informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on the Euro-Mediterranean process, to highlight the importance of making the parliaments of these countries aware of the need to ratify this agreement in particular, as well as other agreements which still remain to be ratified."
"I would, however, like to mention an issue that is often overlooked."
"This is that given that there is a Community dimension to these agreements, and that this dimension concerns trade, the entry into force of these agreements would normally be preceded by a Commission decision. And the Commission has, in fact, as it has done with regard to other Euro-Mediterranean agreements, already brought into force unilateral measures for dismantling customs tariffs, which will provide products from Jordan with easy and swift access to the Community market."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying how delighted I am that the presidency is prepared to put some pressure on the governments which, in turn, I hope will put pressure on their parliaments to proceed with ratification."
"It is quite shaming that after well over six months there are eight Member States still to ratify."
"The Jordanians are particularly sensitive to the slow pace of progress."
"Commissioner Patten is determined to reinvigorate the whole Barcelona process and the European-Mediterranean relationship."
"I hope that the Council will follow that lead and ensure that this is transmitted down through the governments to the Member State parliaments."
"Could he give me some assurance that the Council gives Mr Patten its full support in what he is trying to do in the Mediterranean area?"
"Mr President, with regard to the latter part of Mr Purvis' s question, actions in the Mediterranean area have been one of the Portuguese Presidency' s priorities."
"The Portuguese Presidency also intends to continue the very thorough work that has been done to establish the joint strategy for the Mediterranean, and it has developed various initiatives in this area."
"Specifically, with regard to the agreement with Jordan, even though we acknowledge and regret the fact that the agreement is not yet in force, previous experience has shown that these agreements take around three years to be ratified."
"The most rapidly ratified agreement was the agreement with Tunisia, which was signed in July 1995, and which came into force in March 1998; it therefore took just under three years."
"Our experience with all the other agreements is that they took around three years and I think that the pace of the agreement with Jordan is more or less standard."
"This depends to a large extent on national parliaments. Nevertheless, the Portuguese Presidency will certainly make the various governments aware of this issue."
"As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses."
"Question No 5 by (H-0370/00):"
"Subject: Culture and the WTO The Portuguese Presidency has emphasised the role of culture in the European project and has linked it, in particular, to the need to clarify the European strategy for the future WTO Round."
"Will the Council now make a statement on the issue?"
"Mr President, I gather that this question refers to the issue of culture within the WTO."
"As you will be aware, when the Council' s mandate for the Seattle Summit was being prepared, many Member States were particularly careful to stress cultural aspects and, above all, the European Union' s need to adopt a very firm position in these negotiations on protecting the specific nature of culture."
"I would therefore remind you that in the conclusions of the Council meeting on 26 October on the preparation of the Seattle Ministerial Conference, the idea was expressed that during the forthcoming WTO negotiations, the Union would try to ensure, as it did in the Uruguay Round, that the Member States which comprise the Community would be able to preserve their cultural diversity by maintaining their own cultural and audiovisual policies."
"Honourable Members will be as aware as I am of the fate that befell the launch of the new round of WTO negotiations in Seattle, which has, of course, led to delays in addressing issues of this kind."
"Nevertheless, it is worth noting that within the specific framework of the GATT agreement, that is, of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, it was specified that negotiations on the so-called built-in agenda would have to begin on 1 January 2000."
"These negotiations have begun, but there has been no substantial change of position so far - which is something of an understatement - with regard to progress on these issues, given that this whole process is obviously linked to the start of the overall negotiating process."
"I can also tell you that the Council believes that there is no way that a satisfactory start can be made to the process this year."
"I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his response."
"The reason for asking the question is that we have in our own ideologies many different models at a European Union level which are unique to the European Union as a whole: many times we speak of the European model of agriculture or the European social model, and so on."
"In particular, with regard to things like audiovisual, we had a discussion today in Parliament on the Randzio-Plath report on transparency and financial dealings between undertakings and state aid."
"There is a huge threat now to cultural diversity within the European Union because of the import of programmes from America and globalisation even of food chains like McDonalds."
"That is constantly undermining what is unique not only about Europe as a continent but also about the individual Member States."
"I hope that you and your colleagues will be vigilant in ensuring that we have the opportunity to maintain that diversity, as it adds to what essentially the core of Europe is all about."
"We will continue to address the issue of preserving national identity and the need to maintain a set of instruments which, without in any way distorting the competition rules, can, in some way, ensure that the core values of European identity will be preserved. This applies both to the overall position adopted by the Council, which will, of course, remain the focal point of the negotiations conducted by the Commission on behalf of the Union during the next round, and also at national level."
"The position I have described reflects Portugal' s view of this matter, and I believe that my country is not alone in its approach to this issue."
"Mr President, the WTO deals primarily with issues pertaining to the opening up of markets. For example, there is a discussion on-going at the moment about China, and whether our European manufacturers are to have access to the textile market as well."
"It is a market worth billions and could create many new jobs here in Europe, particularly when one considers that the only possession many Chinese have to their name is a pair of trousers."
"The cultural question I would most like to hear answered though, is this: how are we proposing to handle the language issue in future?"
"France pursues a very independent policy where the French language is concerned."
"Do you see any evidence of similar tendencies on the part of the Germans, Spanish or Portuguese?"
"Are we going to take an even-handed approach in this respect or will we form an assessment on a country-by-country basis, taking into account the respective size of population?"
"I would be very happy to answer the honourable Member if I had any idea at the moment of how the debate on this issue will proceed."
"I nevertheless believe that the Council intends to highlight these different national approaches, which reflect the very diverse nature of the European Union."
"And as regards my own country at least, there is considerable concern that these cultural issues, and specifically the language dimension, should be the very top priority in the discussions that the European Union will be holding with its WTO partners."
"As the authors are not present, Question Nos 6 and 7 lapse."
"Question No 8 by (H-0376/00):"
"Subject: EU agriculture budget paying for the UN mission in Kosovo Will the EU use appropriations from the agriculture budget to pay for the UN mission to Kosovo?"
"Mr President, with regard to the previous questions, I think that when it comes to agriculture, the actions of the Portuguese Presidency are sufficiently eloquent to have answered the honourable Member' s question - even in his absence."
"Turning to the question about financing our policy in Kosovo through the agricultural budget, I must make it absolutely clear that the United Nations mission in Kosovo cannot possibly be financed from agricultural budget headings, since there is no appropriate legal basis for this."
"The current financial regulations do not allow for appropriations to be transferred between two headings in the financial perspectives."
"This does not necessarily mean that there is no intention, as specifically announced by the Commission, to propose an amendment to the 2000-2006 financial perspectives which, in the Commission' s view, would not fundamentally affect CAP appropriations."
"The Council is currently studying this issue, which is highly controversial."
"We know that in this House, too, a majority is against a review of the financial perspectives which would lead to a reduction in the amount available for the common agricultural policy."
"Nevertheless, I repeat that the Commission has stated that there is absolutely no danger of direct aid to farmers being reduced and that this is simply a question of taking advantage of savings essentially flowing from changes in the euro/dollar exchange rate. These savings will be extrapolated over the next two years."
"Furthermore, the Commission considers that the post-2002 review of the CAP, which was, as you know, agreed in the Berlin European Council conclusions, will provide a basis for further savings."
"But as I have said, the Council' s position on this issue is, in political terms, to oppose a review of the financial perspectives."
"The Council considers that a very thorough assessment must be carried out of the requirements of the Balkans and of the real ability of the people there to absorb these funds, particularly bearing in mind and focusing very closely on the role of the European Union as one of the international funding agencies in this area. This request has already been made to the Commission and to the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"We have therefore asked the Commission to provide a schedule showing the indicative distribution of all the contributions that have been pledged, divided into those components which are donations and those which are loans."
"The Council feels that it is only on the basis of this kind of information that an accurate assessment of the Commission' s proposals can be made."
"It is precisely for this reason that the idea of a review of the financial perspectives is not being considered at present."
"What the President-in-Office of the Council has just said completely contradicts what the Commissioner said yesterday, the day before yesterday and on previous occasions in this House."
"The Council' s view is correct: payments to farmers are at stake."
"It is truly outrageous that aid is not paid for nuts - which means they cannot continue to be grown - or that farmers are not being given what they are asking for: a reduction in diesel oil prices."
"Nevertheless, what the Commission does is take funds intended for agriculture, and which have already been approved under Agenda 2000, at the Berlin Summit, as if there were a surplus, and divert them to foreign policy."
"Although I am in favour of aid to Kosovo, I am not in favour - in fact I consider it an outrage - of taking money intended for agriculture, approved under Agenda 2000 - since if we do this it shows that it has been nothing but a smokescreen - and dedicating it to foreign policy."
"My question is as follows: what do we do when the Council says something diametrically opposed to what the Commission says?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what do we do in this event?"
"If Parliament feels that there is a contradiction, it can address this contradiction by comparing it with reality, and the reality is that, contrary to what the honourable Member has just said, nowhere in my speech did I say that direct aid would suffer as a result of this redeployment of appropriations."
"I must make it clear that the Commission has simply said that it would use available funds and that savings would be made in the common agricultural policy."
"That is all."
"This does not mean that the Commission may not present proposals for the redeployment of appropriations, but rather that - as the Commission itself has continued to say - this will not affect direct aid to farmers either."
"- (EL) Mr President, frankly the President-in-Office leaves me speechless."
"First he assures us that no part of the CAP budget will be used for Kosovo or for exercising the European Union' s foreign policy and then he says that, in any case, the Commission has said - and rightly so - that any sums not taken up will be shared out."
"In other words, part of the CAP budget will be redistributed."
"We insist on knowing if the Council really believes that part of the agricultural budget, which has undergone swathing cutbacks for 2000, can be used for purposes which have absolutely nothing to do with the purposes for which the budget was approved."
"Apart from our opposition to the entire policy being exercised by the European Union in Kosovo, the issue at stake is this: we want a commitment from the Council that not one single euro from the agricultural budget will be channelled elsewhere."
"Our farmers are already being squeezed dry, their needs are tremendous, as we see on a daily basis, and it would be unacceptable to take money away from their already reduced budget."
"Mr Korakas, I should like to begin by explaining that most of the appropriations allocated under the ACP framework have been granted through the European Development Fund and are extra-Community budget contributions. They come from the specific EDF budget, which is why I say that it would be rather difficult to transfer EDF appropriations to aid for Kosovo, because they are not part of the Community budget."
"Furthermore, I would like to make one point quite clear: I explained that, at the moment, appropriations allocated to aid for Kosovo are unused CAP appropriations."
"I repeat: they are unused CAP appropriations."
"I would also like to say that, with regard to the Commission' s proposal, I stated quite clearly that currently there is not a universally positive attitude to changing the 2000-2006 financial perspectives in the Council."
"The Council has taken the view that the internal balance of the financial perspectives should not be changed during this phase."
"It is, however, also obvious that the Berlin European Council conclusions are relevant here, as they show that the financial perspectives for the period 2000-2006 provide for a mid-term review, specifically with regard to the common agricultural policy."
"Perhaps it would be worthwhile for honourable Members to consider whether the common agricultural policy will ultimately be compatible with the outcome of the next WTO round."
"The 2000-2006 financial perspectives also provide for a review, which will, for the first time in fact, be dealt with by a qualified majority, and I would also ask the House to bear this point in mind."
"As the author is not present, Question No 9 lapses."
"Question No 10 by (H-0381/00):"
"Subject: Financial assistance to European-level parties Replying to my oral question H-0268/00 in Parliament on 12 April 2000, the Commission took the view that:"
"'The present Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the EC does not constitute a legal basis for funding European political parties."
"The article refers to the importance of political parties at European level."
"It does not, however, empower any of the institutions to enter into expenditure commitments to support European political parties, nor does it provide for a procedure for approving any measure to facilitate the giving of such an expenditure commitment."
"The Commission therefore considers that in the interests of legal certainty it would be best to incorporate an appropriate legal basis for such expenditure in the Treaty establishing the EC."
"This matter should be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference.'"
"Does the Council take the same view with regard to the legal basis for this?"
"Will the matter be placed on the agenda for the IGC?"
"Mr President, as the honourable Member' s question states, it is true that Article 191 of the Treaty does not constitute a legal basis for the funding of European political parties."
"This issue was studied at the Intergovernmental Conference that established the Treaty of Amsterdam, and it was considered at the time - and I say this as someone who was there representing the Portuguese Government - that there was not a majority, let alone unanimity, among the Member States in favour of creating a specific legal basis in this area."
"As regards the Intergovernmental Conference, and particularly bearing in mind the speech made by the President of the European Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, at the IGC ministerial meeting on 10 April, this is an issue that the IGC will consider again."
"I myself, as Chair of the preparatory group, intend to have this issue put on the IGC agenda once again by the end of the Portuguese Presidency."
"In any event, I think that, at the moment, as there is no legal basis, all we can do is try to discover, through the various Member States participating in the IGC, whether or not there is a will to work towards funding for European political parties."
"Mr President, I agree with Mr Seppänen on the legal basis being a primary concern, i.e. it must be in place before expenditure for this kind of support is entered into."
"After this, the amount, type and form of support will surely be for Parliament and the Council to decide."
"In this context, I would like to ask what kind of plans, if any, the Council has regarding these practical arrangements."
"The report on Parliament' s financial administration, in which all political groups were criticised for having channelled parliamentary appropriations into European political parties also, did not take into account the fact, for example, that the office of the Party of European Socialists is situated within the European Parliament buildings, whereas my own group, the PPE, received a great deal of criticism despite the fact that our Party office is situated away from the European Parliament' s services."
"I would therefore like to know whether any plans are afoot as to what might be incorporated in this support, which was jointly decided upon by Parliament and the Council, and what issues will be taken into consideration."
"I would like to tell the President-in-Office of the Council and the honourable Members that we are discussing these issues within Parliament."
"The question concerns the legal basis and the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is one of Parliament' s duties."
"As the author is not present, Question No 11 lapses."
"As the author is unwell, Question No 12 by Mr Bowis will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 13 by (H-0389/00):"
"Subject: Turkish incursion into Iraq What view does the Council take of the new large-scale incursion into Iraq by a heavily armed section of the Turkish army?"
", Council. (PT) We all know that the current situation in northern Iraq and, in particular, the fact that Baghdad is not sufficiently in control of the northern part of the country, are causing a political and even a military vacuum, which have led to Turkey taking direct action."
"This results, de facto, from the fundamentally ambiguous situation in that area."
"It is obvious that the European Union must oppose any actions that could involve the violation of other states' borders."
"But I cannot comment on this issue, except to say that we will remain concerned about the territorial integrity of Iraq and that we believe that anything that could cause this territorial integrity to be violated is undesirable."
"- (EL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, thank you for your reply."
"It was most interesting. You say that the situation is unclear and that there is a political and military vacuum."
"In other words, that Iraq does not control its northern area. Now, forgive me Mr President-in-Office, but Iraq does not control its northern area because we do not let it and perhaps we are right not to."
"But even if we do not let Iraq control its northern area, that does not mean that we have to put up with its being controlled by someone else."
"What I am hearing is quite absurd."
"I imagine that you are unable to defend whoever it is who takes the decisions there."
"Except that, of course, they include members of the European Union."
"Perhaps they could inform you of what is happening in the area and tell you, for example, why they are allowing other people to go into and take control of the northern area of Iraq, which they do not allow Iraq to control, i.e. let us not beat about the bush - why are they allowing military invasion?"
"I think that this situation is scandalous in every sense of the word from an international and political point of view and I wonder how you tolerate it."
"I would just like to say that nothing I have said implies that the European Union is at all complacent about actions that Turkish troops may be involved in beyond Turkey' s borders."
"Question No 14 by (H-0390/00):"
"Subject: European Charter for small companies In the context of creating a business environment conducive to entrepreneurship and innovation, the European Council has called for the drawing up of a European Charter for small companies."
"Can the Council say that, in such a charter, it would support due recognition being given to the very specific nature of the fisheries sector, where such factors as seasonality need to be considered?"
"Mr President, I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply and I am pleased that work is under way and in fact, near finalisation."
"Hopefully, it will not be too long before we have details of the proposals."
"I am also pleased that the President-in-Office has recognised that the engine of growth in the economy are the SMEs providing 70% of the jobs."
"Therefore, it is blindingly obvious that SMEs will play an important role if we are to resolve the very high unemployment problems that we have generally in the Union and specifically in various regions of the Union."
"I did ask a specific question about fisheries."
"Of course, fisheries by their very nature create much-needed jobs in coastal regions of the Union."
"Fisheries, unlike any other industry, depend so much on seasonality and weather factors."
"Could the President confirm that the study which has been carried out would, even at this late stage, look at fisheries in isolation rather than look at fisheries in the global sense?"
"Mr Gallagher, I am sorry that I did not specifically mention your point about fisheries in my answer."
"Nevertheless, in line with the understanding that there has been about addressing this issue on the part of both the Commission and the Council - and this issue will, for example, be considered by the Industry Council tomorrow - we acknowledge the very specific nature of the fisheries sector and we share your concern about the importance of small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in this sector."
"This Charter is, however, a broad policy document and is generically aimed at all small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is not a document that lists measures to be adopted in each sector and assigns priorities to them."
"The Charter is designed to create a universal regulatory framework for small- and medium-sized enterprises as defined at European level, and also to establish stages for implementing these measures."
"There is no provision for defining sectoral measures that could be implemented at EU level once the Charter is approved, and this could only be done in a more technical document relating to the actual implementation of the Charter."
"When I speak to small- and medium-sized enterprises, they are certainly pleased about the mood music that is coming out of the Council, but frankly they are a little sceptical as to whether the Charter will do anything constructive for them."
"They think it is just another piece of paper saying how wonderful they are."
"Can the President-in-Office tell us if this Charter will envisage new Community instruments being created to help small- and medium-sized enterprises. For example, funds to help them with training, education, adaptation of premises or the use of new technology."
"If so, can he also indicate that they will be as free as possible from bureaucracy because the other complaint one gets from small- and medium-sized enterprises is that the funds which already exist at European level are almost unobtainable because of the hoops that they have to jump through in order to obtain them."
"I recognise that small- and medium-sized enterprises probably lost patience a long time ago with the lack of concrete measures aimed specifically at them."
"Nevertheless, although we are aware of the situation, we would ask them to be patient for another three weeks, until they actually see the draft Charter which will be presented at the European Council."
"In fact, the draft version of this Charter will be considered by the Industry Council tomorrow and the Charter will be published in three weeks."
"Furthermore, I think that, like the Lisbon Special Summit conclusions, which Mr Gallagher will surely acknowledge go somewhat beyond traditional, merely speculative rhetoric, the Charter must provide concrete and timetabled measures, with firm objectives."
"With regard to the Charter' s real potential, let us wait for it to be published and then we will, of course, be willing to listen to criticism from small- and medium-sized enterprises and in particular from the European organisations that coordinate and represent them."
"We will be willing to consider all the opinions of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"As they deal with the same subject, Question Nos 15 and 16 will be taken together."
"Question No 15 by (H-0391/00):"
"Subject: Specific directive to combat discrimination against the disabled Pursuant to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provides for action to combat discrimination, the Commission has recently presented a package of measures which include three directives."
"However, although disability is included as one of the forms of discrimination which Article 13 is intended to combat, the package of measures does not include a specific directive designed to counter discrimination based on disability."
"What view does the Council take regarding the possibility of drawing up a specific directive to combat discrimination on the grounds of disability?"
"Should it take a favourable view, when would it expect to present an appropriate initiative?"
"Question No 16 by (H-0396/00):"
"Subject: Combating discrimination At the start of the twenty-first century, which signals a new departure by European society in the direction of greater democracy, cohesion and recognition of the contributions of all citizens, the unacceptable phenomena of racism and social exclusion can be observed."
"In Greece, the exclusion of physically disabled and paraplegic citizens from two competitions is causing a social and political problem. One competition is for the employment of officials in state banks and the other is for the employment of school teachers (primary and secondary) in state education, and the exclusion is because the new Code for Public Employees includes the term 'able-bodied' ."
"The Greek Parliament adopted the Code for Public Employees in 1999, almost at the same time as the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which protects citizens of the Member States from all types of discrimination against them (Article 13)."
"In these circumstances, how is the Council intervening to restore the credibility of the European Union' s policies and the dignity of its citizens?"
"Mr President, under Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Commission has duly presented three proposals which are currently being discussed in the Working Group on Social Issues. These are a proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment at work and in professional activities, a proposal for a directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons, irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, and also a proposal for a Council decision establishing a programme of Community action for fighting discrimination between 2000 and 2006."
"The Commission' s three proposals enshrine different approaches to combating discrimination."
"The first proposal prohibits discrimination in the field of employment based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or beliefs, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"The second proposal for a directive prohibits discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin in the areas of employment, education, access to goods and services and in the area of social protection."
"The proposal for a decision establishing a programme of action for fighting discrimination, which is designed to support and complement the implementation of the directives through exchanges of information and experience, will be implemented by promoting good practice in legislative and other fields."
"Furthermore, the fight against discrimination on the grounds of disability is covered by the first proposal for a directive, which seeks to implement the principle of equal treatment in the field of employment and in carrying out professional activities."
"This proposal covers an area which is crucial to our citizens' ability to exercise their rights, given that this is an area in which discrimination is more obvious and has a more negative effect on integrating people into society."
"As Parliament is aware, it is the Commission that has the power of legislative initiative, not the Council, and therefore the proposals that the Council adopts will be based on what the Commission proposes to us."
"Firstly, I would like to express my satisfaction, both at the existence of Article 13 which has been mentioned, and for the action plan which the President-in-Office of the Council has referred to and which has been developed for the issue that we are considering today."
"However, since not everything in the garden can be rosy, I am not completely satisfied at the moment."
"It is true that Article 13 covers practically all possible - at the moment at least - forms of discrimination."
"However, subsequent regulatory development and the initiatives being proposed are incomplete and unbalanced."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned three examples and I would like to refer to them specifically."
"There are certain cases in Article 13 which are susceptible to discrimination, such as the one we are dealing with today, the case of disabled people, which I believe have been implemented in an irregular way."
"It is true that there are others which are still much less developed, such as discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."
"However, returning to disability, I believe that the European Union requires more complete legislation which covers every possible type, including cases of double disability."
"I would like to know the Council' s opinion - as well as that of the Commission - and I would like to know whether it is considering any initiative for cases such as, for example, women and disability, discrimination on the basis of gender and for the kind of disability involved in the case I have referred to."
"Mr President, Mrs Cerdeira Morterero, as I said, these proposals for legislation have been presented by means of Commission initiatives. The Commission, by using the information provided by its various committees, can, of course, take into account the opinions expressed by various interest groups, and in particular those which legitimately oppose discrimination."
"Regardless of your real reason for asking a question of this nature, we must recognise that, in recent years, and particularly since the Treaty of Amsterdam, very specific measures have been adopted in the European Union to ensure that these issues are addressed in a far more appropriate way, taking into consideration the interests of the various parts of society that are affected."
"In the last few years and over the last decade, the European Union has dedicated a whole approach to this issue and a raft of policies which, although far from ideal, represent a huge qualitative leap forwards."
"At world level, we can be truly proud of the steps that we have taken in this area."
"But I do acknowledge, of course, that we still have a great deal to do and that probably this accumulation of legislative proposals on discrimination may even lead to and require a different legal procedure."
"It is important that we continue to make the Commission aware of this issue and the Council will follow this matter closely and actively."
"- (EL) Mr President and Mr President-in-Office, thank you for the replies which you have given us."
"I should like to remind the House that the European Council in Lisbon highlighted the promotion of social inclusion and called on the Commission, and the Council, to take priority actions for specific target groups."
"One of these groups is the disabled."
"Member States choose amongst these actions according to their particular situations and subsequently report on their implementation."
"What is happening in Greece, as described in my question, is causing me a great deal of concern because the procedure described by the Lisbon Council gives national legislation and practices the opportunity to practice indirect discrimination."
"Perhaps a European observatory should be created so that the specific practices of the Member States and the application of European policy can be better monitored?"
"Also, does the Council intend to work with candidate countries on the recognition of the rights of minority groups, given that we know they are not properly respected in many of these countries?"
"Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, I cannot add much more to what I have already said."
"You are concerned at the shortcomings in the way these principles are being implemented and I would say that such shortcomings will have to be rectified."
"I feel that it is extremely important today for all forms of discrimination to be addressed and monitored at political level, either by establishing a specific monitoring centre or by using existing mechanisms, which are more appropriate for monitoring and managing the experience of individual countries."
"In any event, I must say that the Council follows this type of issue with great interest and I believe that the attention paid by Parliament to such issues is crucial to keeping them on the Community agenda, and in ensuring that the various Member States do not feel tempted to make any exceptions - within their own borders - to what the Union decides as a whole."
"As the author is not present, Question No 17 lapses."
"Question No 18 by (H-0392/00):"
"Subject: Burma What further measures will the Council consider taking if existing measures appear to be inadequate and if the second EU Troika mission meets with no greater success than the first, when the common position on Burma comes up for another renewal in October?"
"Mr President, the European Union has been closely following the situation in Myanmar for several years."
"More recently, at its meeting in April, the Council adopted three additional sanctions against the Burmese regime."
"At that Council meeting - and against the background of the concern that has been felt for many years - the Union' s concern at the situation in Burma-Myanmar was expressed, specifically with regard to the repeated and active repression of civil and political rights, and the harsh conditions that prevent the people from exercising their economic, social and cultural rights."
"Once again, the Council urged the government of Burma-Myanmar to respect human rights, to restore democracy and to establish dialogue with the opposition, which would lead to national reconciliation in a unified and democratic State."
"For this reason, the Council decided to renew the common position adopted in relation to Burma-Myanmar for a further six months and, at the same time, to ban exports of equipment that may be used for internal repression or intimidation, and to improve the current visa system, by identifying those people who are covered by this system and those who support it."
"Furthermore, the Council wishes, with the agreement of all Member States, to refuse to grant an entry visa for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a decision which could be reversed if it is in the interest of the European Union, to freeze assets held abroad by the persons I have just mentioned, who are associated with these acts of repression, and to make greater efforts to explain and promote the objectives of European Union policy on Burma-Myanmar by establishing meaningful political dialogue."
"To this end, the European Union plans to send a second EU Troika mission to Rangoon."
"The Council has furthermore decided to ask the Commission to study the possibilities of increasing humanitarian aid for Burma-Myanmar, with the aim of directly helping the people, and in particular of distinguishing development aid from direct aid to the people, in particular through non-governmental organisations."
"I think that the European Union' s concern about the situation in Burma-Myanmar has been made sufficiently clear and I believe that it matches the concerns that have been expressed by Parliament."
"President-in-Office, thank you for the answer."
"I am, of course, very happy that the new common position has been established by the Council and that it has strengthened the position as compared with the past."
"I prefer to use the name Burma rather than Myanmar since the people of Burma and now Aung San Suu Kyi, the legitimate leader in Burma, do not refer to it as Myanmar."
"I should prefer it if Parliament avoided the term Myanmar also."
"I have to say to the President-in-Office that the net impact of the various measures the European Union has imposed since 1996 has been very limited: the Burmese have not entered into dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and the democratic forces in Burma remain as outside the whole process as ever."
"Whilst I express my support, one thing still puzzles me. Whilst we take these measures, there is no progress on the pressure that some of us in Parliament have been trying to exert on the Council in relation to the need for sanctions - sanctions, of course, which Aung San Suu Kyi has consistently called for."
"Related to that, we continue to oppose the Massachusetts Federal laws which impose very effective sanctions on Burma."
"We are waiting for the US to decide against these Federal laws."
"Will that remain the case?"
"If the US decides in favour of Massachusetts, will the European Union then reintroduce our opposition in the World Trade Organisation to these measures taken in Massachusetts?"
"Mrs Kinnock, I am pleased that we agree on the importance of renewing the common position."
"I admit that the action the European Union has taken in this area may not have changed the situation in any concrete way."
"I would remind you that in this area, my country spent years, sometimes in relative isolation from the rest of the Community, trying to draw attention to the situation in Indonesia, and the success of that pressure was only measurable against the internal reaction and above all against action by the people of East Timor."
"It is obvious, however, that EU action in such a far-off place cannot always have an immediate impact on changing the political conditions that mark the current regime, specifically human rights violations and the lack of respect for these countries' most basic democratic rights."
"I would nevertheless like to refer to something that I did not mention just now. The resolution on the human rights situation in Burma adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission in April of this year is also important."
"I would also like to say - and this is an important point that also concerns the overall framework of relations between the European Union and countries in South-East Asia, and acts as an element of cumulative pressure - that relations between the European Union and ASEAN have, since 1998, been through a rather strained period, precisely because of the problems resulting from Burma' s membership of that organisation."
"Because of the common position on Burma, it was impossible to invite the Burmese delegation to the EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Berlin, which led to that meeting being cancelled."
"I cannot predict what the European Union' s attitude to this situation may be in the future."
"As the author is not present, Question No 19 lapses."
"Question No 20 by (H-0395/00):"
"Subject: Decision-making powers of the Euro 11 The media quite frequently make reference to the 'Euro 11' as if it were a formal decision-making body within the EU's institutional structure."
"Infeuro No 13, however, defines the Euro 11 as follows: 'This is not a Council in any legal sense but an informal gathering of the Economic Affairs and Finance Ministers of the 11 Member States participating in the euro area ..."
"However, Ecofin remains the decision-making body."
"In the light of this statement, will the Council say what exactly takes place at Euro 11 meetings and what implications it may have for the EU's regulated decision-making procedure?"
"Can the Council confirm that no decisions whatever are taken at Euro 11 meetings?"
"Can the Council refute media reports that references have been made at Ecofin meetings to decisions already having been taken by the Euro 11?"
"Once again, I am sorry that the honourable Member who asked a question, this time question number 19, is not present, as this would have given me the opportunity to provide an answer with regard to my own country. In any event, I am more than happy to answer question number 20."
"As stated in the European Council Resolution of 13 December 1997, the meetings of the 'Euro 11' group are informal and their aim is to enable Member States to coordinate, through discussion, issues which relate to the responsibilities that they share with regard to the single currency."
"Formal decisions cannot be taken at these meetings and are, in all cases, as is in fact stated in the Resolution, taken by the Ecofin Council in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty."
"I think that this is quite clear and that this dual framework works in accordance with its own rationale. By that I mean that Euro 11 is an informal setting, and Ecofin is the formal setting."
"The function of the first category of meetings is purely to coordinate the countries that have joined Economic and Monetary Union and which are part of the single currency."
"Thank you for your answer, which I think was important and valuable."
"In the debate in those countries which are not participating in the third phase of EMU and which are not therefore becoming a part of the euro zone, the point has been made that ministers from these countries are losing influence, not only on issues directly affecting the euro, but also on other issues dealt with by Ecofin."
"A real shift in power seems, in fact, to be taking place, from the meetings of Ecofin to those of the Euro 11, despite the fact that the latter are of an informal nature."
"I should therefore like the Council' s representative to confirm that there is no real shift in power whatsoever from the formal, regular Ecofin meetings to those of the Euro 11."
"I should like the Council' s representative genuinely to confirm that it is not the case that ministers from, for example, Denmark or Great Britain, are losing the power to influence other issues dealt with by Ecofin because these countries are not members of the Euro 11."
"Mr Gahrton, the cause of your concern will vanish on the day that these countries attend this Council, which will then no longer be Euro 11, but Euro 15."
"In any event, I must tell you that until then, nothing within the European Union prevents countries meeting in smaller groups than in the normal Community context."
"We are all aware, from newspapers or from conversations in corridors, that various countries in Europe, particularly the Nordic countries, regularly coordinate their positions in a framework that predates the Community decision-making process."
"This coordination does not, of course, mean that there is any transfer of power to the specific framework in which these discussions are held."
"This is purely and simply a coordination of joint positions, and it is perfectly natural that countries that joined the third phase of Economic and Monetary Union and which are members of the single currency should need to find specific measures to express their action and that they should collectively bring these issues to Ecofin."
"I do not think, however, that the position of the other countries is any more restricted in Ecofin than it was at the beginning."
"But, let us be frank here: minorities are minorities."
"This means that the democratic process is at work in Ecofin and there is nothing we can do about that."
"That is how the EU works."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the Portuguese President for his answer, and I would also ask him to confirm that there is no question of an issue being taken off the agenda for any meeting of Ecofin because it has already been discussed in a Euro 11 meeting."
"If that were to happen, would it not be possible for any minister at all to be able to insist that it be put back on the agenda for the Ecofin meeting?"
"Mrs Sandbæk, let us be quite clear about this."
"The Euro 11 arrangement forms part of the framework for coordinating relations between certain countries that have a different level of integration or, to use more modern parlance, closer cooperation as predetermined in the Treaty, and this involves certain coordination mechanisms."
"The Euro 11 Council can obviously discuss whatever it likes, and may even agree that a certain issue is not discussed in Ecofin. This does not mean that the countries that are not members of Euro 11, but which are, of course, members of Ecofin, cannot raise that issue under the Ecofin Council agenda."
"What must not happen is that a country that is not part of Euro 11 is asked to set the agenda for those that are."
"I must say one more very simple thing, Mrs Sandbæk."
"The other countries are not in Euro 11 or Euro 15 only because they do not want to be, not because anyone has banned them from joining."
"Thank you very much, Mr Seixas da Costa."
"We hope that you have success with your contact with the Parliamentary group on the important issue of the Statute of Members."
"Since the time allocated to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 21 to 31 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Telecommunications/radio spectrum policy"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0094/2000 by Mr Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Fifth Report on the implementation of the Telecommunications Regulatory package (COM(1999) 537 - C5-0112/2000 - 2000/2072(COS));"
"A5-0122/2000 by Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Next Steps in Radio Spectrum Policy - Results of the Public Consultation on the Green Paper (COM(1999) 538 - C5-0113/2000 - 2000/2073(COS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, deregulation in the telecommunications sector has continued for a decade and it has been a great success."
"The traditional telephone as we knew it is now a fading memory."
"In the past, people acquired a telephone in order to keep in touch with each other, but now they have become shareholders in a company, which could, for example, be acting as an intermediary in sexual services."
"I am sure this has come as a surprise to many."
"The instrument itself is so tiny that it could, for instance, be inadvertently placed in the mouth, being mistaken for false teeth; in this respect, too, things have changed a lot."
"Deregulation created fears of a fall in standards of public services and an increase in telephone charges."
"This has not happened, however, and instead services have become diversified and prices have fallen."
"Money to finance all this has, of course, been generated by new data terminal equipment, networks and services."
"The 1988 regulatory package was well timed and - due to its efficient implementation - worked well in several Member States."
"In some countries, however, implementation has been slow and even formal."
"We would support action by the Commission to improve cross-border services and honest competition."
"We are concerned at the fact that the limited supply of user access has prevented many user groups - in particular those with lower resources - from taking full advantage of, for instance, reasonably affordable Internet access."
"Therefore, we need new alternative loop systems, we must facilitate the development of wireless local loop systems and also, for instance, the use of a cable TV network, without having to resort to specific legislation on this issue, however."
"Parliament notes that due to the variations in its implementations, the current regime has led to legal uncertainty in different Member States."
"Sufficient transparency on the specific conditions for operating licences is required, so that undue delays in the approval process can be prevented."
"The most important reform strategy of the European Union is a reform initiative called eEurope, the framework of which was recently approved in Lisbon."
"The Commission must be congratulated on the fact that the structure and strategy of the European information society differ in a positive way from others in that it has not only taken account of competitiveness, but also of elements such as cohesion, social equality and employment."
"The objective is to prevent social discrimination and to increase consumer confidence and social cohesion."
"This initiative is impressively entitled: ""An Information Society For All"" ."
"The radio spectrum is a scarce natural resource which has now started to come up for auction."
"We take a negative view of this with the exception of certain special instances."
"We were aware, as early as two years ago, that the GSM auction in the USA had resulted in a state of chaos, i.e. bankruptcies."
"Experiences from India are equally bad."
"Those in favour of auctioning believe it to be a good means of controlling resources."
"We think it will lead to increases in user tariffs and delays in the spreading and development of communications services."
"Prices at auction have now become incredibly high, and these will be passed on to the consumers, resulting in a new telecommunications tax. This would be an unfair tax, in that it would be the same for both rich and poor."
"Now that the eEurope initiative - with all its worthy objectives - has just been approved, it is being obstructed by the imposition of a new 'digital divide' , a greedy fee-charging principle. In practice, this means that our priority project, the development of an information society, is now being obstructed through taxation."
"This is cause for concern, which, in my opinion, should be looked into in greater detail. I therefore request that the Commission investigate, without delay, the impact of this, the auctioning principle, in different countries, in order that we should have more information on which to base our opinion."
"Furthermore, this principle will privilege big operators, who will start dividing up the market. In the end, there will be the fear that as we reduce regulations, i.e. deregulate, these big operators will make mutual agreements and 'reregulate' , creating new regulations."
". (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the idea of using the radio spectrum to transmit signals revolutionised telecommunications and new applications for the radio spectrum have been developed continuously ever since."
"Thus, we have progressed from the simple wireless telegraph to the digital transmission of sound and image, satellite navigation and the third generation of mobile telephones."
"I should like at this point to stress that the radio spectrum is not used solely for telecommunications."
"Apart from applications based on the transmission and reception of radio signals, there are also 'passive' applications which just receive signals emitted by natural phenomena."
"The main applications here are radio-astronomy, which studies natural phenomena beyond our planet on the basis of the radio waves which they emit, and Earth observation, both of which use the radio spectrum."
"The constant increase in the demand for radio frequencies for new applications is such that we need to review the principles on which they are distributed and the policy which the European Union needs to apply in this sector."
"The European Commission responded to this need by publishing a Green Paper on Radio Spectrum Policy for public consultation at the end of 1998."
"It subsequently issued the communication which we are examining today on the basis of the aforementioned public consultation."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, having expressed its satisfaction with the work of the European Commission, has come to a number of conclusions and has formulated a number of principles."
"Starting from the premise that the spectrum is a valuable but scarce natural resource and that the demand for it is rising constantly, it stresses that it must be used efficiently in order to best serve the public interest and help develop new high-quality services."
"In this respect, the Committee on Industry considers that spectrum policy cannot be solely market-driven, that the economic and social value of the radio spectrum should not be assessed on the basis of profit opportunity and that we need a balanced combination of commercial and social interests."
"The Committee on Industry also stresses that specific measures need to be taken in order to guarantee a satisfactory number of frequencies for public and private radio and television broadcasts, for amateur radio operators, for navigation systems and for passive applications, such as radio-astronomy and Earth observation."
"The Committee on Industry accepts the proposal of the European Commission to create a Spectrum Policy Expert Group having a purely advisory role and transparent internal structure and modus operandi."
"However, although it acknowledges that it would be advisable to further harmonise Community radio spectrum policy to an extent, as far as pan-European services and applications are concerned, it does not accept the European Commission' s proposal for a new regulatory framework at pan-European level, considering this to be both premature and hurried."
"I should like to draw your attention to one issue which seriously worried the Committee on Industry and which Mr Paasilinna mentioned just now. I refer to the degree to which the principle of spectrum pricing, auctioning and the introduction of a secondary market should be adopted."
"Your rapporteur takes the view that radio frequencies per se should not be bought and sold, because this would result in frequencies' being diverted from their intended purpose."
"Other practices, such as auctions and a secondary market, would result, with mathematical accuracy, in the prevalence of stronger economic interests, which would then monopolise the market."
"Your rapporteur is in favour of an overall payment for each commercial service which uses the spectrum."
"The Committee on Industry did not adopt my view and, although not in favour of auctions in all cases, considers that they could be applied for commercial uses."
"I should like to point out to members that the results of the recent auction of radio frequencies for third generation mobile telephones in the United Kingdom have given rise to second thoughts on the subject."
"The huge sums paid will not come out of the companies' profits; they will be paid for by users."
"I have heard that in the United Kingdom, in order to find the money paid at auction, every man, woman and child will need to spend 400 pounds a year on telephone calls."
"We must not lose sight of the consequences which such practices will have on the final user."
"I therefore call upon the House to vote in favour of Amendments Nos 4, 12, 5 and 6, so that our final resolution includes a clear position against auctions."
"Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I wish to congratulate Mr Paasilinna on his report, which we very much welcome."
"He has drawn up not only a very concise but also a very hard-hitting report."
"It is entirely appropriate as a response to the telecommunications communication from the Commission and exactly what we needed to give us a basis on which to move into our further consideration of the whole electronic communications package, which we shall be debating again in a month's time."
"I want to focus on some of the key points highlighted in the report."
"I am going to leave issues on radio spectrum policy to my colleague, Mrs Niebler, who will be responding on behalf of our Group to Mr Alyssandrakis' report."
"Just to move forward on some of the issues related to opening up the market."
"The first and most encouraging thing from our point of view is that we now see the wisdom of opening the telecommunications market."
"To have an open competitive regime has now become the accepted wisdom."
"It is something that is fully accepted and we now need to translate that and move that forward as quickly as possible, towards further deregulation and even quicker opening of those markets that still work imperfectly."
"There is a tremendous amount of detailed analysis in this report and it clearly shows the consumer benefits in price reductions, choice and increased services that have flowed from deregulation."
"However, it also clearly shows that there are far too many barriers, and the Commission has our full support in tackling them."
"For consumers to benefit from this choice, they have to be encouraged to shop around, to compare in many cases what can be quite complex offers of prices and contract terms and service packages."
"We would like to encourage independent regulators to work together to provide simple, impartial price comparisons for consumers and use the sort of new tools they have available, like the Internet, to give consumers the ability to calculate the real cost of their calls."
"We encourage the regulators to share best practice with each other to provide a unified price and contract comparison system."
"We will not have a developed market unless we have investment."
"The other issue we have to address is the ability of investors to make satisfactory returns on their investment."
"Therefore, in looking at the market-opening regulations, we have to look at methods of competition and encourage competition between the different parts and elements of the platforms."
"That is something we shall address in the next communication."
"We welcome this report, which is really going to encourage market-opening to the benefit of consumers and the European economy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, previous speakers have mentioned the broad consensus that exists concerning the profits arising from the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector."
"There was no such consensus previously."
"To my great delight, I note that it is liberals who have been in the vanguard of this change: Commissioner Bangemann, together with Finland' s former Minister for Transport, Mr Norrback, who was among the first ministers to liberalise this sector."
"I would point out, for example, that, last year, we in Finland noted that GSM prices were, on average, seven per cent lower."
"Even foreign calls were ten per cent lower than previously."
"We are therefore still making quite large strides in this area."
"I also hope that, in the future, we shall be able to conduct a similar open dialogue with the Commission regarding development within this sector."
"The Commission is undertaking many investigations and inquiries."
"We need impartial information to be able to keep track of developments and, as public decision makers, to be able to take the necessary decisions."
"These two reports deal with issues both large and small."
"In common with previous speakers, I would express my appreciation of the constructive cooperation that has taken place with the rapporteurs."
"The major issues are about the ways in which broadband services can be made available to everyone and about the auctions we have touched upon."
"Clearly, it is up to each Member State to decide upon its strategy for obtaining networks with high transmission speeds for everyone."
"However, we wish today to offer vigorous support to the Commission' s recommendation that dominant network operators should be responsible for permitting combined services all the way to the subscribers."
"In certain Member States, that is already the case, for example in my own country, Finland."
"Even there, consideration might be given to going further by introducing a situation in which dominant operators become responsible for hiring out the telecommunications companies' premises for the purpose of housing equipment."
"I think we need to see to it that we utilise existing capacity as far as possible and obtain better service and, in that way, lower prices."
"The auctions issue has provoked discussion and does so every day."
"One might well wonder if it is a question here of being penny wise and pound foolish."
"Apart from the risk of the auction prices for third generation mobile telephones putting the brakes on development, there are two other matters I should like to emphasise."
"There is a risk of roaming for third generation mobile telephony being put in jeopardy."
"There may also be a risk of barriers arising between the Member States."
"I would therefore hope that the Commission is alert to this question and that we can engage in a creative discussion on the subject."
"Mr President, Commissioner, twenty years have passed since the philosopher and essayist, Alvin Toffler, identified the new information technologies as the third of humanity' s great revolutions."
"Nevertheless, in Europe, we once again failed to take much notice of our thinkers and, in the meantime, over the last decade, the United States has increased its GDP and income per capita to above European Union levels, where, in the last year, these indicators represented barely 75% of US levels."
"While half of the world' s internet users are American and 44% of US homes have direct access to the networks, in Europe that proportion is barely 15%."
"We are now rapidly turning to the information society, information technology, the Internet, the Galileo network for monitoring and intercommunication by satellite, the liberalisation and convergence of telecommunications and technological advances in general."
"For all these reasons I would like to call for the prompt transposition in all Member States of all the directives relating to radio-broadcasting and voice telephony, the interconnection and maintenance of digitisation, general authorisations and licences, leased lines, open networks, mobile telephones and data protection."
"In this regard, we should condemn the fact that the national regulatory authorities of certain countries - such as Spain, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom - are not playing their part to the full, which has led to complaints from new companies, who have found that the telecommunications monopolies that already exist are placing obstacles in their way and delaying the consolidation of free competition to the detriment of users."
"Furthermore, we ask that, as soon as possible, flat rates be established for access to the Internet, to the network of networks, and we even argue that they should be free, since they should be offered, like health and education, as an essential public service to the citizens."
"Mr President, there has been a change over to electronic capitalism, both in Europe and worldwide."
"On the stock markets, there is a 'gold rush' for the shares of IT companies - IT shares are a present-day Klondyke."
"The reports by Mr Paasilinna and Mr Alyssandrakis emphasise the necessity of rules even for gold prospecting: if the common and public interest is not secured, the richest, largest and fastest players will take all, and they will reap all the fruits of the new technological developments."
"A rapid concentration of the information industry is in progress - at the consumers' expense."
"The battle over market shares for next generation mobile phone frequencies, for example, will raise consumer prices sky high."
"As we know, the profit from these shares will ultimately always be generated through the prices of telephone calls."
"We must now ensure that public interest is secured - as proposed by Mr Alyssandrakis - and ensure the availability of sufficient frequency bands for use by public broadcasting."
"This will not be possible if such a restricted natural resource as the radio spectrum is auctioned off for the monopolised use of the highest bidding major companies."
"Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, in 1993 the European Union undertook to open up the telecommunications market."
"Since then, this decision has led to the adoption of a series of directives, and we have constantly been reminded that there is a political objective underlying these regulations, namely growth, employment, competitiveness and the provision of access to the information society for all citizens, with the necessary legal protection."
"In this context, the Commission has performed its monitoring role and produced a raft of reports, and the communication we are discussing today is part of this undertaking."
"I must say that the assessment presented to us is, at least, detailed."
"Although, during the two years since the market was completely opened up, the telecommunications market has been characterised by growth, newcomers to the market and some price reductions, nonetheless, gaps have also appeared which are serious to say the very least, including what is known as the digital divide between regions and between citizens caused by the cost of accessing these new services and, along with this divide, the exclusion of some citizens or regions from the new technology society."
"It is therefore imperative that we do not lose sight of the objective of providing a high-quality service for all citizens if we want to avoid creating a fresh division within our society."
"Moreover, today we are debating reducing the cost of Internet access within the framework of local loop competition."
"The objective is admirable, but we must avoid certain errors and must, therefore, discuss the matter very thoroughly with the national authorities."
"Once again, I would stress the need to simplify the rules, as well as consumer protection, the role of the national regulatory authorities and the licensing system which has been discussed at great length."
"Finally, opening up the market is not an end in itself: it is a means of ensuring that the transition to an information society is made by and for all citizens through the creation of permanent jobs, and this is certainly not always the case in this field."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Reino Paasilinna for his thorough and excellent work in preparing this report, but I would also like to thank the Commission, which has done so much in support of this eEurope initiative and the expansion of the Internet."
"As the Commission has stated, there has been a lot of progress in the past few years in the EU telecommunications sector, but there is still a lot to be learnt where the mobile phone market is concerned."
"For instance, the availability of carrier pre-selection should be considered, and this facility made available to consumers, if studies confirm that they are going to benefit from this pre-selection."
"In future, it is incumbent on the Commission to ensure more vigorously than ever that the 'roaming' fees charged to users by operators are brought down in all EU countries to a sensible level based on actual costs."
"At the same time, the Commission must ensure that the fees collected from the operators remain under control."
"The EU' s operating logic thus falls into two stages."
"The operators are not allowed to collect fees from the users, but neither must the public authority collect from the operators."
"The costs to the operator might become unreasonably high, should the new generation mobile spectrum be auctioned."
"Auctioning may also distort competition, if operators start making 'tactical' bids for the spectrum in order to harm the position of their competitors at auction."
"Therefore 'beauty contests' between the various operators are clearly more consumer-friendly alternatives."
"The latest UMTS auction in Great Britain, where prices soared sky high, will, in any case, set the alarm bells ringing."
"After the hammer has gone down, it is always the consumer who foots the bill - and that is exactly what we do not want, all of us being consumers ourselves."
"If we also want to introduce the Internet into schools and libraries and make it available for everybody on a very large scale in future, and if we also want to utilise its future potential in competition with the USA, the Internet will have to be affordable to all."
"President, Commissioner, colleagues, can I add my congratulations to the Commission and to my two colleagues, the rapporteurs, on the speed and thoroughness of their reports."
"I want to comment on both reports in a very few, but I hope, significant respects."
"On Mr Paasilinna' s report, I want to comment, and perhaps ask the Commission to comment on the whole question of the balance between regulation and liberalisation."
"Mr Caudron touched on this in his remarks to the effect that the benefits of liberalisation have been felt disproportionately in the business community and those who make long distance and national calls while domestic consumers have benefited much less, particularly those who make very few calls, or people who live on their own."
"I want to ask the Commissioner about the speed of regulation and the purpose of regulation."
"It was good to see the Commission taking very urgent action, for example, in respect of leased line and the charges for leased lines where the existing legislation had not been properly implemented."
"The differences in attitude, ethos, resources and the degree of independence among the national regulators are still a cause for concern."
"On the report on spectrum, others have mentioned the question of to what extent it matters that different systems for deciding on third generation mobile licences have been sorted out."
"It significant and I would like the Commission to comment on this in respect of third generation mobiles, and digital television, which are the two areas where the European Union has a lead."
"I also want to ask the Commissioner whether he thinks the application of the subsidiarity principle in respect of the allocation of licences might do something to narrow that lead."
"If he thinks so, if he thinks the differences in methods are going to distort competition, is he able to tell this House what steps he will take to monitor and address that question?"
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mr Paasilinna and Mr Alyssandrakis on their very timely and invaluable work."
"As part of an on-going exercise of monitoring by the Commission, the Fifth Report sets the scene for many of the conclusions and recommendations made in the communication' s review, which was issued at the same time, and on which we, and the European Parliament, are working right now."
"Mr Paasilinna' s report inevitably touches on some of the issues to be addressed by the final proposals, which we will discuss here again next month."
"The Commission shares many of the concerns expressed in Mr Paasilinna' s report on the current regulatory situation."
"They are vitally important for the uptake of the information society, for the development of the Internet, e-commerce and m-commerce - mobile commerce."
"They offer unbundled access to the local loop, facilitating developments in licensing, co-location, carrier pre-selection and the independence and the powers of national regulatory authorities."
"The Commission is addressing many of these problems which you identify at the moment."
"It has the very recent recommendation on the local loop and on bundling."
"The Commission will also use its powers in regard to competition to monitor carefully dominant positions."
"We have also made a revised recommendation on interconnection pricing and now we have on-going enforcement measures and infringement proceedings, for example, against a number of Member States on carrier pre-selection and local tariff structures."
"Pending the adoption of the new framework, which will be presented in June, the Commission will continue to press for effective implementation of the current rules."
"This is called for by market players, national regulators and national administrations and has now also been unanimously mandated by the Lisbon Summit."
"At the moment, the Commission is preparing the sixth framework report to be adopted during 2000."
"Parliament' s report will provide important input."
"I am sure that the report will be an important benchmark as we follow the development of the information society."
"Cable systems will be examined more closely by the Commission."
"We already have a policy of pushing for divestment of cable TV networks to ensure greater local competition and to stimulate investments and services, as Parliament is calling for in these reports."
"As to the radio spectrum issue and the report of Mr Alyssandrakis, I agree that radio spectrum is an increasingly scarce and valuable resource."
"It is used in many policy areas of concern for the EU, such as telecoms, broadcasting, transport, research and development, which are all very important for the European economy."
"For that reason, the Commission proposes a harmonised approach."
"Mobile and wireless communications develop at a rapid pace and the unexpectedly high results of spectrum licence auctioning in the UK show the growing importance of the sector."
"Furthermore, the messages of the spectrum Green Paper demonstrate the need to address certain radio spectrum issues at Community level and to reach a balance between various user sectors."
"Second, Community action on the radio spectrum is beneficial if taken within a clear regulatory framework."
"In addition, political support is required to facilitate the achievement of Community objectives at international level."
"We have the on-going radio conference in Istanbul where issues like Galileo or third generation spectrum will be discussed."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the report from Mr Alyssandrakis."
"As this report calls for a radio spectrum policy, which fulfils Community policies, further harmonisation of radio spectrum is necessary."
"We have to see development of information and communications technologies and a balance between all spectrum needs including private and public interest."
"The competitiveness of European industry at global level must be developed in the interest of the European citizen."
"At the same time, the Commission would like to stress that it is urgent and not premature to have an appropriate framework at the Community level to implement the spectrum policy options agreed in the Spectrum policy group and to ensure that results of harmonisation mandates are implemented in the Union."
"We should be able to promote without delay harmonisation measures which respond to technological and market developments."
"The Commission will report annually to the Council and the European Parliament on the measures adopted."
"As far as further actions are concerned, the Commission will present by the end of June - after Parliament' s discussions and the votes on the radio reports - the appropriate framework for radio spectrum policy in the EC."
"This will also take into account the results of the overall discussion which is now taking place in the 1999 review."
"We well understand the debate on auction prices which have received a lot of attention here."
"According to the present new rules, the Commission must recognise the authority of Member States to choose their preferred spectrum licensing method, whether it is the administrative or auction method, but the Commission will closely monitor developments to avoid distortion of competition and ensure the implementation of the licensing directive and also technological and service developments in the interest of EU citizens."
"Mrs Read put a question about the balance between competition and regulation."
"I would say that we need regulation to push for competition because otherwise bottlenecks can actually prevent competition which can help citizens because it will be the incentive for lower prices and higher quality services."
"But there are areas where we also have a major public policy interest, especially in regard to universal service and data privacy."
"In those areas the Commission will make proposals in the context of the new legislation on electronic communications which will be presented at the end of June."
"At the same time, the Commission also intends defining this balance between the markets and public policy in the context of the Europe Action Plan, which should be presented next week."
"Finally, as far as the coherence of the licensing arrangements is concerned, we must ensure there will be no distortion of competition and guarantee the implementation of the licensing directive."
"This whole discussion is very important for defining the content of the new electronic communications legislation, and I am sure these issues will not be the concern of only a few passionate expert parliamentarians as is the case today - electronic communications will be a major political issue in the years to come."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Coherent European approach for space"
"The next item is the report (A5-0119/2000) by Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission working document: Towards a coherent European Approach for space (SEC(1999) 789 - C5-0336/1999 - 1999/2213(COS))."
". (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the launch of the first artificial satellite by the Soviet Union in 1957 marked the start of space exploration and the beginning of a new era for mankind."
"Man' s ability to launch space vehicles has extended our frontiers well beyond the Earth' s atmosphere and has afforded us a wealth of new knowledge on the solar system and the universe as a whole."
"At the same time, it has brought practical applications which have changed our lives."
"The use of artificial satellites in telecommunications, weather forecasting, Earth observation and navigation is so widespread that it is hard to imagine these activities continuing without the use of space."
"Moreover, the high technical standards required of space equipment have led to enormous technological breakthroughs, which have gradually filtered into our everyday lives."
"Finally, space has always had a strategic importance, since whoever controls space also controls the Earth."
"Space is the one sector in which international cooperation is particularly important."
"In Europe, the European Space Agency (ESA), an independent body comprising 14 European countries, 12 of which are members of the European Union, has played a critical role in fostering cooperation in space exploration, space applications and the development of research in space."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament have all addressed the issue of space policy on a number of occasions in the past."
"The main political issue in the entire discussion concerned the development of a coherent approach to space and the promotion of collaboration between the European Union and the ESA on the basis of specific targets and within a clear framework."
"The Commission' s working document being examined today comes as a response to the Council' s resolution of 22 June 1998 calling on the Commission to take practical measures to promote cooperation between the European Union and the ESA."
"The text discusses aspects of the European Union' s space policy concerning practical applications, mainly in the fields of telecommunications, navigation and Earth observation, but makes no mention of space exploration or the use of space for scientific research."
"From this point of view, the document is somewhat limited in scope, since an overall policy for space cannot restrict itself merely to practical applications."
"The Commission has made it clear that a coherent approach is indispensable for the European Union."
"It has therefore set up a consultative structure for space and related matters with the active participation of the ESA."
"This structure comprises the Space Advisory Group and other high-level groups."
"The Commission' s document concludes that the European Union must find new means of implementing a space policy and proposes specific lines of approach."
"The resolution by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy expresses a strong desire to see space used for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind as a whole."
"At the same time, it takes the view that space policy must not be wholly dominated by the market and that account must be taken of long-term assessments of the benefits and risks of exploiting space, not only from the point of view of the interests of industry, but also in terms of the welfare of mankind as a whole."
"It stresses the importance of international cooperation, the need for all Member States to participate in space activities and the importance of collaboration with third countries, and points out that the ESA has functioned efficiently and has played a leading role in space research and space applications in both Europe and worldwide."
"The Committee on Industry welcomes the European Commission' s intention of establishing a policy framework for future programmes and stresses that this framework must be developed after extensive and in-depth consultations between all the parties involved."
"It is in favour of the further development of launching systems, the development of new telecommunications systems and further European participation in the Alpha station programme and reiterates the European Parliament' s support for the development of the global satellite navigation system known as Galileo."
"It calls on the Commission, in collaboration with the Member States, to take all measures needed for effective use of space-based systems for monitoring the environment and for security, in order to protect citizens' lives and natural resources, identify at an early stage, or even avert natural or man-made disasters and help combat fraud."
"I am convinced, fellow members, that today' s debate will help to develop space policy further."
"Mr Alyssandrakis, ladies and gentlemen, everyone is in favour of mankind' s direct or indirect access to space for, in the first place, it is a dream, a fantastic adventure and a way of expanding our knowledge."
"But, in addition to this, it has, above all, generated incredible change in our everyday lives."
"Satellites and telecommunications have been mentioned, and we could add the weather forecast."
"However, we must also acknowledge that space is a strategic issue: we have mentioned the terrible war between the United States and the USSR."
"Today, although the United States and Russia still dominate this sector, the countries of Europe play a major and increasingly significant role."
"It is of paramount importance that we establish a European strategy if we want to lend more weight to the Union and this strategy must maintain a balance between the various uses made of space."
"The European Space Agency has played a role which has been crucial for the cooperation between European countries in the field of the exploitation of space and research development."
"However, as the rapporteur suggests, it would appear necessary to extend its activities to projects launched within the Community framework."
"We must also make up for the absence of a genuine European policy and a European strategy ensuring the effective use of space systems to monitor the environment and to provide security, protect natural resources, detect or forecast natural and man-made disasters and combat fraud."
"A large chunk of the practical applications involving space is already controlled by the market, and I feel that this is dangerous."
"The Commission must put forward measures to control what are genuine abuses."
"Lastly, together with many of my fellow Members, I am extremely pleased that the Galileo project met with such approval. It will ensure that Europe makes a substantial contribution to the establishment of a worldwide satellite navigation system."
"To sum up, the new approach to space policy must be based on a close partnership between the Member States, the European Union and the European Space Agency."
"This is the only way to achieve the consensus such a policy requires."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, the European market for space applications is fragmented."
"There are many smaller companies active which do not work together very well."
"In order to be able to compete on the global market, it is necessary to restructure the space industry, that is to say integrate various companies into one company or group of companies."
"There is, as such, plenty of work for the space advice group."
"Cooperation at Community and international level in space activities is imperative."
"My second point concerns the position of the European satellite industry."
"Since the end of the cold war, the strategic importance of having our own satellite industry has been of commercial importance."
"The sector is growing by 10% annually and thus helping create employment."
"If the European Union does not want to miss the boat, the Commission and Member States need to promote the development of the industry."
"Satellite systems are the means to further develop information and communications technology."
"Unfortunately, the European satellite industry is very much dominated by governments."
"This is why it works too much in isolation, without a great deal of interaction with the computer, network, software and peripheral equipment industry."
"As a result, the industry is increasingly losing its market share to the US."
"More cooperation and company mergers are needed, as well as more support in technology development, through the framework programme, among other things."
"My Group is waiting with bated breath for the document the Commission has promised on a European space satellite in which, needless to say, the input of the European Space Agency is vital."
"All this noise is making things very difficult: the sound quality is dreadful."
"I would appreciate it if the technicians could do something about it."
"Thank you, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel."
"The Bureau has also noted that there is a problem with the sound, but this problem can, of course, only be fixed when we are not working."
"Let us hope that the sound quality will be better tomorrow."
"Mr President, although I do want to congratulate Mr Konstantinos Alyssandrakis on his extremely comprehensive report, I have to say that, on this occasion, the Commission, in particular, and this final report have not been bold enough as regards the European space research initiative."
"As has already been said, there is no longer any competition between America and the Soviet bloc, and yet, for all its scientists and technical expertise, Europe is unable to launch itself into space and space research."
"We need to increase funding and create a specific budget heading for space research."
"The European Union should manage national space research budgets, for space research is, by nature, one of the main activities of the European Union and would clearly not yield satisfactory results if carried out merely at individual State level."
"We need to create a European Union space body which is separate from the ESA: the ESA is something different."
"We need to organise the launching of low cost European Union satellites to serve European industries."
"Finally, I would like to point out that pensioners should somehow be included in this space research."
"How can this be?"
"Well, in the United States, a famous pensioner, the astronaut John Glenn, went into space at the age of 69."
"I am 55 years old and in 15 years' time I will be 69."
"I am already a politician: I could become an astronaut, the first pensioner astronaut of the European Union."
"I am booking my seat today!"
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Busquin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"European research area"
"The next item is the report (A5-0131/2000) by Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: Towards a European research area (COM(2000) 6 - C5-0115/2000 - 2000/2075(COS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would first of all like to thank Commissioner Busquin for launching a broad debate on a European research area."
"It comes at exactly the right time, between two framework programmes."
"At present, there is no European research area as such."
"The research policy of the Member States and that of the Union are running parallel without forming a coherent unit."
"In addition, we invest far less in research than the United States and Japan."
"These two factors have caused the chasm between us and the United States to widen even more over the past few years."
"If the European Union wants to invest in more competitiveness, and thus more employment, we will need an approach which is broader and more innovative than the one we have pursued so far."
"The forthcoming enlargement of the Union makes this all the more pressing."
"The European Member States need to leave behind their technological nationalism and strive more towards a European Union for research and technology too."
"This means that European researchers need access to each other' s national programmes."
"The European framework programme for research and technological development is a useful instrument for stimulating international cooperation, but this programme on its own is not enough to boost the joint European research efforts."
"Although it only makes up 6% of total European research expenditure, the framework programme fulfils an important multiplier function, a kind of flywheel function."
"Industry pays 60% of total investments in research in Europe, 90% of which is spent on research to improve existing production processes and, in this way, to retain the competitive edge."
"Only 10% is spent on new innovative research."
"As such, the framework programme certainly makes a considerable contribution to this 10%."
"Europe has no problem converting euros into research, but has far greater difficulty converting research into euros."
"It appears that commercialisation, i.e. injecting expertise into a product, seems to be much more successful in the United States than it is in Europe."
"A better link is required between the development of new technology and application in the market."
"In this respect, increasing expertise is not a goal in itself, but translating expertise into innovation and industrial success, however, is."
"It creates employment and prosperity."
"Universities and companies therefore need to work more closely together."
"As is the case in the United States, the work of scientists should alternate between academia and industry."
"Commissioner Busquin has now indicated how a European research area could be brought about."
"However, he mainly focuses on optimising the infrastructure by, among other things, incorporating centres of excellence into a network and by setting up Virtual Centres."
"But I believe that in order to bring about a European research area, we will need more than measures in the sphere of infrastructure."
"Infrastructures do not innovate, neither do electronic networks, although they are a prerequisite."
"But a European research area can only be created if, in addition to an advanced infrastructure, we also have a European identity and European creativity."
"In my view, the potential of women has been neglected for too long in this respect."
"My final point concerns the lack of a Community patent."
"The existing European patent system causes fragmentation and leads to considerable extra costs."
"A patent application in Europe is ten times more expensive than it is in the US and far more involved."
"Not only do we not have a Community patent; the mechanisms to help small companies protect their patents are also lacking."
"Will the Commissioner consult Mr Bolkestein to do something about this?"
"After all, small- and medium-sized companies do not have the means to pay for expensive legal procedures."
"Finally, I would like to state that Europe needs a joint research policy which accommodates both applied and fundamental research in various technical specialist fields and which takes into account the fact that innovations often emerge at the interface of different scientific disciplines."
"In future, new employment could mainly be created within the specialist areas of bio-technology and ICT, but also research into human and social sciences will remain necessary in the European Union, with its large diversity of cultures."
"I would like to thank my colleagues for their kind cooperation."
"Mr President, I have to say with great regret that I disagree with my colleague, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, on one point, namely this: if there is any end worth pursuing in human life it is knowledge for knowledge' s own sake."
"If there is any impulse which contributes to good research it is the impulse of pure curiosity."
"It has been work done out of pure curiosity for the sake of knowledge as an end in itself which has, in the end, produced the big spin-offs that make a real difference."
"I agree with her, however, that it is not enough to justify spending public money on the ground that somebody suffers from acute curiosity."
"Therefore, it is the promise of long-term applicability and long-term economic contribution that justifies the expenditure of public funds."
"But we must remember that public funds will not be well spent unless they are spent on people who have the drive of curiosity and the commitment to knowledge for its own sake."
"That is something which we in Europe forget at our peril."
"It is mentioned in clauses 'n' and 'o' of the preamble."
"I am very grateful for that."
"Indeed I am very grateful to Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for the way in which she has worked into the report of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy practically all the points that were contained in the draft opinion from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for which I was responsible and which is the reason for my addressing you tonight."
"The whole is better than the sum of its two parts."
"It was very good of her to work it in so effectively."
"The amendments by Mr Pietrasanta and Mrs Maes, which add the points about sustainability, environmental goods and health, to the other economic points that we have been making, are important and should be adopted."
"There is indeed a European crisis in research funding."
"We must increase it."
"It must go up to 3% from the current pathetic 1.8% - about half of what our Japanese and American friends and competitors put in."
"Legal devices are important."
"We should improve the European patent."
"Subsidiarity is all-important; subsidiarity, as the Commissioner has said, in its broadest sense - regions contributing to research as well as Member States and the Commission, right down to the research team."
"They are the people at the sharp end."
"We must make sure that we never have systems of research support that are so over-burdened with bureaucracy, with application mechanisms so difficult to penetrate that we use resources in applying for research funds that should be spent doing the research itself."
"Simplicity is all and subsidiarity means, in this context, simplicity and an appropriate period of research review."
"We also need other things."
"We need due and proper attention to mobility and all that goes with it, proper research careers throughout Europe, the chance for people to gain employment in research and to move freely."
"The omens are not entirely good."
"We have seen, in the case of the foreign language lecturers in Italy, that 12 years have passed with immobility enshrined in European law because the right to free movement without regard to nationality has been denied and has not yet been effectively enforced by the Commission."
"We really must insist that improvement is achieved here and is carried through from the teaching community into the closely allied research community."
"In short, we must do at Community and Union level the things that can only be done at those levels and push the rest down."
"All that is stated in paragraph 40 of the report."
"We must also be better at developing and applying the knowledge we achieve."
"My colleague in Edinburgh, Professor Salter, has developed a device for destroying mines safely."
"It has never been taken up industrially."
"Many good ideas that are developed do not get taken up."
"That is also vital."
"Mr President, I have great pleasure in responding on behalf of the EPP and ED Group, and on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, who was the shadow rapporteur in the Industry Committee but who unfortunately cannot be here tonight."
"I have the pleasure of shadowing Mr MacCormick in the Legal Affairs Committee."
"You have already heard that this is indeed a formidable combination and an extremely comprehensive and thorough report from Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, but Mr MacCormick added his own distinctive touches to the report, the flavour of which you have just heard."
"Clearly, the thrust of the Commission' s thinking that has gone into this report and indeed our response has focused on two aspects: competitiveness and coordination, because research capability combined with the ability to translate that research into products and services of real commercial value is going to be the key to the competitiveness of the European Union and the enlarged Union into this new century."
"We really need to make better use of all the intellectual capabilities that we have across the European Union by improving ways of working together, particularly by better focusing our efforts, by not duplicating that work, by bringing together the original thinkers that Mr MacCormick was talking about."
"Anyone who has worked in research will know that if you get people together you spark new and creative ideas all the time."
"That activity cannot really be achieved by a lot of centralisation."
"The Commission has a job to do as a catalyst for the process."
"As Mr MacCormick says, we have to get people across the Union together talking region to region, university to university."
"We have to have better information networks, we have to have this exchange of information horizontally, not coming into the centre and going out again."
"We have now fantastic new tools to be able to do that."
"After all, the Internet was a tool intended to facilitate research networking."
"That is what it was originally designed to do and we now have the ability to use it and to think about how we are going to develop the telecommunications capability, the ways of using it, the structure that we talked about in our early debate on telecommunications, the idea of virtual centres of excellence."
"That, I think, is a factor of very great importance in trying to achieve this focus and this synthesis of ideas."
"If anything should be brought forward very quickly in a pilot stage by Mr Busquin and his team, it is the idea of moving into the virtual centres of excellence and achieving progress in certain key areas."
"The second point I want to make links in with our competitiveness."
"I echo very much the closing phrases of Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel to us just now: we have to encourage research and development of skills on taking products to market."
"We have to improve the ways that we do that."
"The processes of original design are prototyping, testing and making."
"We have to reduce the time to market, to take these ideas and move them out to consumers as soon as possible, to make products simply, quickly, more effectively, more flexibly."
"Those are very important skills that we need to develop and research has a very important part to play in that."
"In welcoming Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s report, we are anticipating the next stage, Mr Busquin, in meeting these challenges that we have thrown down."
"We look to you to turn these proposals into tangible ideas to achieve the objectives that we all share."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the communication under discussion forms an important introduction to closer cooperation in the field of research."
"As things are now, resources are wasted due to overlapping and lack of coordination."
"On behalf of the ELDR Group, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, for a good report and for her extremely enthusiastic work for this cause: your views have the full support of my Group."
"The statistics indicated in the communication regarding the poor level of investment by EU countries in research are cause for concern."
"Even worse is the fact that the gap with respect to the USA is widening."
"However, some Member States have made considerable investments in research, and this appears to have paid dividends, particularly in the area of information technology."
"While I have the floor, I would like to bring up a few additional points."
"I would prefer to talk about cooperation or strategy, rather than research policy."
"The word policy has a connotation of activities being closely controlled by Brussels."
"In research, however, objectives for activities should not be defined at too detailed a level."
"Each research community is best aware of its own needs for investment and development - these should not be too tightly controlled by policy."
"The participation of women in scientific research within the EU continues to be too fragmented."
"More tangible action must be incorporated in the programmes in order to promote this participation."
"Researcher exchange programmes and interaction between research teams are matters which deserve our full support."
"They are a means of disseminating information and skills; these activities will create true European cooperation - networks which will also bear fruit later on."
"The COST secretariat has already produced some commendable work."
"Its position as research coordinator should be further strengthened."
"Mr President, it is, of course, essential to develop a European research area, but this must not operate simply in areas neglected by the Member States."
"It must be built openly, sharing competences and resources at as early a stage as possible, in order to ensure optimum synergy."
"I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her very dynamic work on this report."
"We must naturally consider the economic impact and job creation, as our fellow Member, Mr Desama, said. In the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we do not give priority to the pursuit of competition and competitiveness at any price, or to the commercialisation of research."
"Both fundamental and applied research must, above all, retain public support and a public dimension."
"We are opposed to the areas of biotechnology focused on genetic manipulation or patenting the living organism. On the other hand, we are in favour of research focusing on sustainable technologies, particularly in the areas of the environment and health."
"As the Committee of the Regions advocated in Mrs Blandin' s report, we wish to emphasise support for decentralised research, the formation of networks, collaboration with the regions."
"For example, the cooperation which has developed through the ecosites, in the field of ecotechnologies, according to the criteria of sustainable development, is appropriate to local development and to supporting SMBs and SMIs."
"Europe may be a significant driving force in this field."
"I should also like to stress the aid which we wish to provide for new information and communications technologies by developing virtual laboratories for data collection, analysis and diagnosis, and prevention in the area of major risks."
"There is here a potential which can only be realised fully at European level, in collaboration with universities, centres of excellence and the authorities."
"Finally, I should like to flag the interest we have in the Joint Research Centre, a subject that is well worth thinking carefully about."
"Its nuclear bias, which was topical when it was set up because of the involvement of Euratom, must now be reconsidered."
"It is not a matter of duplicating the installations or the research carried out in some European Union Member States but instead of developing, as Mrs McNally suggests, a shared system of technical and scientific references for political applications."
"In this respect, there is also a need for serious thinking about the STOA."
"In conclusion, I wish to thank our Commissioner, Mr Philippe Busquin, for undertaking, as soon as he arrived, this investigation into a European research area which we support."
"He did not neglect the areas of schemes on behalf of young people and the participation of women in research and, in continuing liaison with the Member States and with Parliament, he is working towards developing a knowledge-based Europe in the latest fields, without neglecting social and human aspects."
"Mr President, Commissioner, considerable research is indeed essential to be able to make sense of the 27 recitals and 60 paragraphs of a report which has reached oversized proportions due to the studies of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and which contains absolutely everything, albeit in occasionally vague and often inexact terms."
"Let us begin, however, in a spirit of constructive criticism, by welcoming the fact that this contribution towards achieving better integration of the European scientific community seeks to safeguard the balance between fundamental and applied research in order to combat the brain drain, to prioritise the problem of unemployment among young researchers within a European policy which is aware of the reality of the situation, and to recognise the leading role played by businesses in research and development."
"We might then, also, reiterate what the report said, by emphasising the risk that concentrating research infrastructures, with a view to establishing a cost-effective critical mass, would represent for the peripheral regions, which are, in general, increasingly being disregarded by European programmes."
"Attention should also be drawn to the need to adhere strictly to the principle of subsidiarity, in order to leave the Member States and, through them, the regions with genuine local driving forces for research centres in direct contact with the worlds of business and academia, the ability to define their own priorities and methodologies under their own responsibility."
"Finally, let us dare to hope that your laudable concern to develop communications and translation services in order to eliminate the language barrier to the desirable synergy between the work of our respective researchers is not a cover for a further attempt to promote one of the Union' s languages above all the others, a language whose imperialism would be no less neutral here than elsewhere."
"Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group is going to vote in favour of your report, but I would ask you, in practical terms, will it be effective enough for us to achieve our shared goal, which is high-level scientific knowledge generating improved performance in every field?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s excellent report, which we have before us, on the European Commission communication, ""Towards a European research area"" , has aroused genuine interest in the House judging by the fact that almost 150 amendments have been tabled."
"Clearly, the development of research within the European Union is one of the keys to the future."
"The twenty-first century will be the century of knowledge and grey matter."
"Progress in communications effectively increases the rate of dissemination of knowledge, as the development of the Internet demonstrates, and is a powerful factor in promoting economic growth."
"In the broadest sense, then, research will, more than ever, be a fundamental element of future development."
"According to the figures made available by the Commission, Europe is definitely lagging behind the United States."
"Here are some examples of this: the average investment in research for the European Union as a whole is no more than 1.8% of GDP, as opposed to 2.8% in the United States; the number of European graduate students studying in the United States is twice that of American students in Europe."
"On this subject, the proposals of both the Commission and the Plooij-Van Gorsel report lead me to make a few observations."
"The first is that European investment in research is at least as important as the European research area."
"In the United States, there is rather less concern for semantics and more for practical action."
"The second observation is that approximately two thirds of research is undertaken by private companies and that the European Union must take this situation into consideration when focusing its resources."
"My third observation is that we must absolutely avoid anything which, from a distance or close up, looks like what has just been referred to as a master plan for European research."
"Research is, first and foremost, a matter for freedom and not for planning."
"This is all included in the Commission communication and the report by our fellow Member."
"There is, however, no prioritisation in the proposals, and this is something I would like to suggest."
"This prioritisation should focus primarily on researchers and businesses."
"As far as researchers are concerned, their standard of living throughout Europe must be enhanced."
"As far as businesses are concerned, research work must be encouraged."
"My conclusion is as follows: that we should first back the people involved, then business and, finally, that we should ensure that the European Union does not hinder the activities or the development of either party."
"This is what our approach must be."
"So the area ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for her usual very good report."
"I thank the Commissioner, whose timing is very good and so is his idea of launching this debate."
"There is indeed a growing feeling of unease at the lack of coordination in European science and research."
"The response has been positive, as the Commissioner knows from his contacts throughout Europe, including a recent visit to Cambridge."
"We are looking forward to seeing his analysis of the results of the consultation."
"There is a growing awareness in Europe of the dimensions of the threat from the very well-resourced, very well-targeted United States of America."
"Frankly, the EU is not punching its weight in research, although some Member States are very good."
"I would name Finland, Sweden and countries like the Republic of Ireland, which have made good progress."
"Apart from industrial competitiveness, of course, as Mr Desama says, we have serious environmental and social problems which need research to put them right."
"A target of 3% of GDP on research is realistic and essential, as is the recruitment of far more scientists, including women."
"Please do not underestimate the potential of the Joint Research Centre, which is itself a scientific centre for policy - a reference centre for policy - and is ideally suited to the role of networking the centres of excellence."
"It is itself a centre of excellence in many areas."
"I strongly support paragraphs 16 and 17, which call for informing the European public about scientific achievements and looking at ethical questions."
"We look forward to regular reports from the Commissioner about the implementation and realisation of this very exciting and essential project."
"Mr President, it is impossible to say something meaningful in two minutes about such a challenging report as the one written by Mrs Plooij without getting very frustrated, because one could say so much more and, more to the point, would want to say so much more."
"I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his ambition, which is considerable."
"Trying to create a European research area is an ambitious plan, because this research space is currently lacking and we only have ourselves to blame. We make insufficient resources available, although we all - and Mrs McNally underlined this a moment ago - acknowledge the link between progress, development, and creating prosperity and jobs."
"This is evident to all of us, yet our governments fail to set aside sufficient funds."
"This is true for the Member States and regions, some of whose percentage levels are shamefully low."
"We should, as it were, sound the praises of certain Member States and regions, but should not work on averages."
"This is why it is good to emphasise cooperation."
"Pyramids and hierarchies are not really of much use here, because we know that talent bubbles up from below and from all those regions and all those milieus where talent breeds, both male and female, although female talent - and this has been pointed out many times before here - can only ascend to the very pinnacle of academia very slowly."
"Cooperation, however, requires organisation."
"And really, the absence of this is something we only have ourselves to blame for."
"If our organisation of the scientific environment lags behind, we will not achieve a European research area."
"After all, it is exactly this area, where people can communicate a lot more freely with each other than before, which has to ensure that scientists feel at home in Europe."
"I really have to ask the Members to exercise some self-discipline. I am sorry to interrupt you, but time goes on and, at this rate, we will be here until gone midnight, and surely that is not what we want."
"We cannot do this to the Commissioner either."
"Mr President, as a scientist on loan to politics, as I like to describe myself, who has worked in the most advanced laboratories in Italy and elsewhere and who has worked with highly advanced countries such as the United States and Japan, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her extreme sensitivity, her competence and her enthusiasm."
"I would, of course, also like to thank all the members of the committee, irrespective of their political party, and, in particular, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the academic world to Commissioner Philippe Busquin for the extreme sensitivity he has shown in creating, at last, a European common research area."
"The creation of a common research area in Europe will, at last, make it possible to fully exploit networks of high quality centres and achieve that critical mass which is essential both for the progress of knowledge per se and to provide practical answers to the man in the street: answers which cover a range of issues, from the control of terrible illnesses such as AIDS or cancer to neurodegenerative diseases or injuries caused by environmental pollution and so forth."
"This is why we support the Commissioner!"
"Dear Commissioner, what a challenge! We will keep fighting in order to overcome that red tape which tends to delay the achievement of these goals."
"The adoption of the amendments I tabled will greatly promote recognition of the common research area and boost its efficiency."
"Thus, the first amendment, which calls for at least 3% of the gross domestic product of all the countries of the European Union to be allocated to research, represents a great victory and will allow us to compete with the United States and Japan."
"The second amendment I tabled on behalf of the poor, vulnerable and abandoned regions, the Objective 1 regions of the South, i.e. to invest 5% of the unused regional funds - which would otherwise be taken back - to benefit those regions, will, at last, make it possible to exploit the excellent human resources available to us and close the gap in infrastructures and technology between these regions and the regions of Europe."
"The third amendment, which was also approved by our friend Mr Novelli - whom I would like to thank - will apply tax exemption and, thereby, at last make it possible to further increase the level of research carried out in all sectors."
"Commissioner, I would therefore like to finish by paying tribute to the new scientific research structure which you have introduced. On 20 June, two Nobel prize-winners, Rita Levi Montalcini, holder of the Nobel Prize for neuroscience, and Renato Dulbecco, will pay tribute to this initiative, in recognition of the fact that, at long last, in establishing the research area, you have conferred great honour on all research scientists."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cooperation in terms of research is difficult in Europe, far more difficult than it is in the United States and this is why Commissioner Busquin' s communication is so significant."
"Investment in research and in cooperation must lead to more economic growth and more employment."
"This effort deserves all our support, and this is why I can give my full backing to the report by Mrs Plooij, to whom, by the way, I would like to convey my sincerest compliments."
"But I would prefer it if we were a little more precise in our debate."
"We have to ascertain that not all research leads to more economic growth or more employment."
"The demand for research is huge where supporting policy choices, risk analyses, environmental effect reports, monitors and comparative research is concerned."
"It is all part of the preparation or assessment of political decisions in the environmental sector in the area of food or public health."
"In these particular areas, European cooperation is meaningful."
"The Joint Research Centres, the JRCs, have many examples of sound cooperation projects."
"In many research areas, the JRC researchers find themselves in a situation much like a spider in a web."
"Where research in support of policy is concerned, initiatives from the Commission are therefore vital in order to prevent work from being duplicated, to avoid fragmentation and to ensure that the best measuring methods and the best techniques become the benchmark."
"But in this type of work, no major spin-offs in the employment sphere can be expected outside the research centres."
"There is also great demand for applied research, which can be expected to have a far greater impact on employment."
"But European policy could restrict itself to creating appropriate conditions, and practical obstacles should be cleared away."
"I would like to finish off by saying a few words on basic research."
"Research situated between applied and basic research now has a lower profile but remains significant."
"Many fundamental questions in the fields of natural and life sciences remain unanswered."
"It is precisely in these spheres that coordination of national research efforts is of major importance."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her invaluable work."
"On account of the amendments tabled in committee, this report ended up being more wide-ranging; when dealing with issues related to research areas, we must not focus solely on scientific communities."
"The role of the SME sector as a locomotive force for innovation and research work must also be clearly borne in mind."
"The Commission' s communication provides an unnecessarily one-sided view of the challenges of European research."
"It is obvious that, in the preparation of this communication, there has been no horizontal utilisation of the expertise of the various directorates."
"Since the discussion on the research area touches, for example, on the enlargement process of the Union and on the vitality of the SME sector, one would have wished that the Commission' s communication had presented more visions and concrete content."
"It is not enough to talk in broad terms about the competitiveness of the Union."
"Keywords in research policy are flexibility, global thinking, and the more effective use of resources than at present."
"The self-directed nature of science and the Member States' own research policy priorities must be accorded sufficient space."
"It is therefore necessary to give careful thought to what will be required in the future of the joint research centres highlighted in the Commission' s proposal."
"On no account is it appropriate to enlarge the role of the Union' s research centres in such a way that the operations of national research centres are made more difficult in the context of resource reallocation."
"Most of the added value of the internal market approach in research will be acquired specifically through the more even distribution of the research and know-how which is funded by non-public resources."
"Practical experience has shown that by working within framework programmes it is not possible to react sufficiently flexibly to problems which demand rapid action, such as the BSE crisis."
"Increasing, for instance, the mobility of researchers according to need and enhancing the cooperation between the scientific communities of the EU and Eastern Europe will create a reliable and credible basis for research projects."
"In this discussion, particular attention must also be paid to the position of women in European research policy; the body of technical experts in particular - which actually suffers from a labour shortage - is alarmingly male-dominated."
"The EU must accept that one of the most important challenges for its training and research policy is to awaken women' s interest in this sector."
"Mr President, Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, ladies and gentlemen, I am personally delighted to have this opportunity to express an opinion on the Commissioner' s communication and to be able to tell him that it is a document of extremely high quality which, as we have seen again this evening, has provided the basis for a relevant debate on revitalising research in Europe."
"We have effectively entered the knowledge society, which has led us to put research back at the heart of our society."
"In Europe, however, as many people have said, the position of research looks worrying if one looks at the figures."
"It is therefore necessary, as a matter of urgency, to adopt an overall strategy at European level in order to make up for lost time."
"It is not a matter of casting doubt on the efficiency of the FRDPs. Their results are plain to see."
"It must be noted, however, that new initiatives need to be adopted in order to decompartmentalise Member States' national systems which today represent nothing more than a duplication of efforts."
"Among the many measures which must be implemented, this evening I shall mention, in particular, the training and the mobility of researchers, to go back to a previous debate which involved the Commissioner and researchers from my own region."
"I am speaking, therefore, to voice their concerns, for we are not training enough scientific researchers and even fewer European researchers."
"The training of researchers should therefore include a European dimension, which would offer them greater mobility."
"Schemes do exist, but, in the real world, before and during implementation, there are administrative obstacles to mobility, such as welfare cover, which discourage many researchers."
"I shall end by saying that we must also devote ourselves to informing the citizens, in whom scientific progress raises as much hope as concern."
"I therefore hope that, in June, our ministers will be able to approve the rapid establishment of a whole series of building sites in Europe, on the basis of the Commissioner' s proposals."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Busquin for deciding and having the courage to create a European research area, bearing in mind that, in the field of knowledge, we have always fought hard for the principle of solidarity."
"I am a member of the Committee on Culture and in fact Parliament has not taken up the opinion of this committee."
"I am the only person from that committee who is speaking in this debate."
"I very much regret the fact that the contribution of the Committee on Culture has not been allowed to enrich the debate."
"In this respect I would like to offer some constructive criticism."
"Firstly, I would like to say that this is a laudable and courageous piece of work, because subsidiarity is a straitjacket which is holding Europeans back despite the brilliance of their desires and their minds. Nevertheless, it lacks a parallel project, which is concerned with human resources."
"Much is said about money and companies, but we never take into account - or at least we only do so in the small print and indirectly - the fact that it is a question of human resources and that therefore research requires training, training and more training."
"In Europe there are no training programmes for researchers."
"FEDER and the FEDER projects do not cover grant holders."
"Furthermore, the fifth research plan only includes one person per project, although it is impossible to carry out a far-reaching project with grant holders alone."
"The personnel available to us include very few post-doctoral teachers and we do not have sufficient staff."
"How can we talk about mobility if we do not have researchers?"
"This is the great challenge we have to face and, in this case, I would support Mr Rübig and others who have proposed specific training programmes."
"We must support the universities and researchers because, in Europe, working in research means sacrifices and a career full of risks and very few rewards and, of course, no economic reward."
"I repeat that we must recycle our teachers."
"Only by means of a strategic European resources plan can we do so."
"Lastly, I would like to express my fear that only centres of excellence will be recognised."
"Mr President, I will confine myself to stressing three points tackled by Commissioner Busquin which are also referred to in the report under debate."
"The first concerns the close relationship between research, economic growth and employment."
"In order to respond to the challenge represented by the United States, the Union as a whole and certain countries in particular must allocate a higher proportion of their resources to research and facilitate investment by private companies."
"I subscribe to the view that we need to propose tax relief, harmonised at European level, as a guideline for the Member States."
"Point two: research and development have generated an extremely well integrated system."
"In some areas, it is not easy to distinguish between basic and applied research."
"However, public financing and the European programmes need to target chiefly medium- and long-term economic and non-economic objectives, whereas competence for market-related research should lie chiefly with the firms."
"Thirdly, the tertiarisation of research policies and the consolidation of the role of the regions: The territorial aspect of research policies is important chiefly in terms of the transfer of scientific and technological knowledge towards the small- and medium-sized enterprises which characterise many industrial districts."
"Small- and medium-sized enterprises are one of European industry' s strong points, in certain countries in particular, but they are still poorly integrated into the research system."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to add my thanks to those that have been expressed already."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for the excellent report she has drawn up within a very short time limit."
"I should like to thank Mr MacCormick of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and all of you for your contributions, as well as for your contributions to the debate this evening."
"As I have already said, I believe that this debate requires collective action and that you, as Members of Parliament, can play a decisive role in relations with the scientific community and industry."
"Rest assured that I and the other members of the Commission will be ready to pursue this dialogue and this debate tomorrow."
"In this respect, I think that this Parliament resolution is going to provide strong democratic support for the text ratified by the Lisbon Council which, moreover, set practical goals and deadlines."
"We should realise the extent to which the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lisbon served to highlight - what I believe is very important - the key role of research policy, as we have again pointed out this evening, and to acknowledge the importance of this role in the advent of a knowledge-based economy and society."
"We are at a juncture which gives us hope that greater and more crucial progress may be made in this area."
"In addition, I should like to stress the importance of consulting the scientific community, with its awareness of developments, but also the industrial world, which can gauge the importance of the issues at stake."
"Let me now outline a few points in the resolution, not in order to reopen the debate, Mr President, given the late hour, but in order to put a few brief comments to you."
"I consider that the concept of centres of excellence is one worth developing further and, in this connection, there is one essential principle, and that is that excellence is the condition sine qua non for scientific and technological progress."
"Such excellence does exist in Europe, in all the Member States, but at an inadequate level of critical mass, and this is a situation which could be improved."
"This is the significance of all these networks of centres of excellence that must be created without necessarily specifying the exact infrastructures involved."
"It is a matter of human resources, but it is something that must be set up in order to have the ability to raise levels in Europe."
"And, as Mr Harbour pointed out, this excellence may also come in a virtual form in the modern technologies and high-speed networks we wish to see set up."
"As regards fundamental and applied research, I think this is a matter of balance."
"These two aspects are closely linked."
"Everyone accepts this, both the world of industry and the world of research, of course, in the same way as they accept multidisciplinarity, which is one of the results of scientific developments."
"In order to create the necessary dynamic, it is therefore essential to develop the concept of benchmarking."
"I think this is an instrument which will make it possible, at European level, to create this dynamic, and also to instigate proactive and open coordination."
"I think establishing a patent is a condition sine qua non, as has been adequately pointed out."
"Mr Bolkestein, who is responsible for the internal market, is well aware of this."
"Indeed, I should like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament for having, with a view to the Intergovernmental Conference, insisted on initiating a discussion on a European legal body, since this is an essential condition for bringing about this Community patent."
"Finally, as far as small- and medium-sized businesses are concerned, the matter of the patent is a crucial factor, quite apart from more specific elements."
"The aspect of regional development has been stressed, and I attach great importance to this, as successful experiments have been conducted in some regions and these should be exhibited as an example throughout Europe."
"I also attach great importance to the link between research and the Structural Funds, not forgetting the role of the European Investment Bank."
"In connection with this, discussions have been held with the European Investment Bank and schemes are underway to ensure that the EIB has a still more dynamic role in matters related to innovation and transposition and, since this was mentioned, that includes with candidate countries."
"The Joint Research Centre and its specialist role have been stressed, and the goal of 3% of GDP is, I believe, an ambitious but necessary goal in all Member States."
"So, to be brief, I should simply like to inform Parliament of the forthcoming stages."
"The first stage is clear."
"I would first of all like to emphasise just how important it was that Parliament expressed its opinion today."
"This is why I wished to thank Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel for drawing up her report so quickly, and also all the Members of Parliament for debating the matter in such detail within such a short time period."
"The next stage, then, is the Council of Ministers responsible for Research, which will take place on 15 June."
"This report will provide practical examples to support the determination that we must display."
"For I have clearly understood that practical action is needed."
"So, regarding the practical action, let me quickly list a few points, starting with benchmarking."
"With national research policies, the methodology exists."
"I think that the Member States accept this methodology, with the establishment of a high level group of representatives."
"Initial results will be available by the end of the year."
"A map of areas of excellence in Europe is being drawn up, with the cooperation of the national specialist institutes."
"That is no surprise to anyone, I think."
"I am hopeful that this map will also be ready by the end of the year."
"The mobility of researchers presupposes the mobility of workers in general."
"The ambition of Mrs Diamantopoulou and myself is to set up a group made up of representatives from each Member State in order to identify where the obstacles lie."
"Regarding Women and Science, in fact, on the initiative of Parliament, a sizeable group of five hundred women has been set up."
"You are familiar with the very interesting report that this group produced, which triggered policy in each of the Member States. I shall be able to give you the results of this in the near future."
"Finally, as regards electronic networks, Mr Liikanen and I wish to increase these to several gigabytes very soon."
"That, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is what I wanted to tell you briefly, given the time constraints and that I do not want to detain you further."
"I do, however, wish to express my heartfelt thanks for the interest you have shown in this debate."
"I believe we have to set up a dynamic, one that must be enhanced, and I promise that I shall give you progress reports on a regular basis."
"I hope that, together, we shall be able to open up the European research area that I believe in so strongly."
"Thank you very much for your contribution, Commissioner."
"Given the time, we should not hold lengthy discussions."
"I am not a spokesperson for this debate but I would nevertheless like to congratulate Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel at this stage on this important report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Peking action platform"
"The next item is the report (A5-0125/2000) by Mrs Smet and Mrs Gröner, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the follow-up to the Beijing Action Platform [2000/2020(INI)]."
"Mr President, this initiative report is the European Parliament' s contribution to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly which will be held in New York in three weeks' time and where the actions of the past five years will be assessed as a follow-up to the World Conference on Women in Beijing and where, at the same time, a declaration will be issued to re-establish the commitments made and to see what needs to be done in the next five years."
"As such, it is an important report, because it will be the only report from the European Parliament."
"I hope that we will be given the opportunity - and this is also a request to the Commission - to do some preparatory work with the Commission before we leave for New York to ensure that we are singing from the same hymn sheet."
"I think it is useful to be on the same wavelength because, as regards women' s liberation, we could expect Europe to play some sort of a pioneering role."
"Europe has done this in the past and we must be able to continue to do this."
"But before I talk about this pioneering role, I would like to say a few words about the assessment itself."
"Commissioner, it is particularly difficult to carry out an assessment if there is no data available to check on the precise extent of progress made by the different European countries over the past few years."
"No statistical data exists."
"There are reports on the twelve topics which we need to discuss in New York for each country, which show exactly how much progress has been made with the assessment."
"I am therefore delighted that you announced in the discussion on the fifth action programme that you would like to set up a kind of observatory where an effort will be made to collate all possible gender-related data."
"After all, there is an enormous gap in this field."
"I would like to direct my second point to Parliament itself."
"The efforts we needed to make in order to finish this report suggest that the Secretariat of the Women' s Committee is heavily understaffed."
"There was very little in the way of cooperation, and had it not been for the fact that Mrs Gröner and myself had hard-working collaborators, then there would probably not have been a report now."
"It is a disgrace for Parliament that other committees can apparently acquire excellent secretariats and well-equipped secretariats with many staff, but that this is not possible for the Women' s Committee."
"It may be useful that we, together with the women involved, should take an initiative."
"That is all I have to say as regards assessment and I will not touch on it any further."
"For the next five years, I believe that the action programme, the five-year programme which the Commission is presenting for discussion at the moment, is of huge importance."
"It obviously comprises the traditional themes, which is quite normal because, although the world moves on, these themes are still on the agenda. Admittedly, there are new emphases but, at the end of the day, they are the same recurring themes."
"The first theme I would like to mention is the world of employment and the new emphases which should, in my view, be applied."
"These include the new technologies and the fact that there are too few women in this sector, if any."
"This was also said a moment ago."
"Other matters to be emphasised are the division between work and family, as is provided for in the employment guidelines, and equal pay for equal work, something which I find the Commission is not emphasising enough and which is receiving insufficient attention."
"There is still a chasm between men and women in terms of wages."
"Another theme is decision making."
"The Commission has made efforts, as has Europe, but mainly in the political sphere."
"I think that efforts should also be made with regard to both sides of industry."
"Far more attention should be paid to them since they manage and control a large part of social life."
"On the theme of violence, too little attention is being paid to violence within the family, in my opinion."
"Attention is being paid to violence in the work sphere, and so forth, but not so much within the family."
"In my view, more attention should be paid to the media, which is such a determining factor in social life."
"Women are very much absent in the media."
"As for women' s rights and human rights, I hope that some progress can be made at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Finally, I already said that Europe is expected to play a pioneering role."
"I would mention two areas, in particular."
"Firstly, if we grant development aid or if we have contacts with third countries, we should not just prescribe conditions with regard to the economic position of women."
"We are now familiar with this."
"We know that in many developing countries, the economy is carried by women, and we support this."
"This much we now know."
"What we do not emphasise enough in our contacts with third countries is that human rights should be respected with regard to women, too."
"What is happening in Afghanistan is unjustifiable."
"It is unjustifiable that, in a number of countries, female circumcision is still practised and that we maintain the best relations with these countries as a matter of course."
"Secondly, with regard to the Union' s enlargement to include the former Eastern Bloc countries, it will be vital that the screening report to be compiled by the Commission should give a sound account of what is happening there, because there are signs of regress instead of progress in this regard."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the special session of the United Nations General Assembly, which will be held at the beginning of June under the banner 'Women 2000: Gender equality, development and peace for the 21st Century' , will be of enormous importance to the situation of women."
"The monitoring of the application of the Beijing Action Platform reveals that the greatest concerns, in relation to the proposed objectives, are still education and training, power and decision making, health, poverty and violence."
"The social changes of recent years have affected women in a special way."
"The increase in the elderly population has had a great effect on the lives of women who, in general, when they are no longer looking after their children, have to look after their parents."
"Despite considerable progress in terms of the situation of women, there are still considerable differences, especially discrimination at work and different wages for the same job."
"The majority and, in many cases, all of the responsibility for domestic tasks falls to women."
"The situation of women with family responsibilities, combined with the difficulties in the labour market, have led to a term which is explicit as well as unfair: the feminisation of poverty."
"We still require initiatives which help to give women access to the labour market and allow them full professional development, to which end we will need to facilitate women' s 'other' work through nurseries and financial aid."
"Men will have to take more family responsibilities and adapt to a society which is constantly changing and which has modified their traditional roles."
"The information society requires increasing numbers of people with technological training, which women must get involved in, since this is an area for which they are particularly well-equipped."
"If the number of women involved in decision making were to increase, it would become easier to resolve the problems facing them."
"A lot of progress has been made, but there are still political and economic areas in which women are under-represented."
"Amongst the problems which women are unfortunately facing at the moment, we must mention the violence directed at them: domestic violence, armed conflict and trafficking in women, which has been increasing in recent years."
"This is a form of violence against their person, their fundamental rights and their dignity."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the integration of the objectives of equality into Community policies and, especially in Article 141, positive actions in the field of employment."
"Employment is usually also a solution to other problems of marginalisation, economic dependence, lack of personal freedom, etc. The fifth Community Action Plan will have to deal with the problems still existing through a budgetary provision which will allow programmes to be implemented in the most urgent areas."
"The cooperation of the media is essential to achieving these objectives."
"Mr President, 'Half the sky is borne on the shoulders of women' , a successful man once said."
"But the heavens are not enough."
"Women account for more than half the earth' s population and yet remain unheard and under-represented within most political, economic and social spheres."
"That is unacceptable."
"In the course of the centuries, women have demanded their rights as full citizens."
"They have ranged from, in the northern hemisphere, female campaigners for the right to vote to, in the southern hemisphere, groups opposing genital mutilation."
"In the course of the Beijing Conference in 1995, a common action plan was decided upon for these different groups of women. This was a milestone in the recognition of women' s rights as being integral to human rights in general."
"Just about all the governments of the world endorsed the Beijing Conference' s action plan."
"The Beijing Declaration distinguishes twelve critical areas and defines views and long-term objectives which should be adopted by governments, the United Nations, national movements and private industry in order to improve the conditions under which women live."
"Five years later, discrimination against women is still widespread, and violence against women is still a global phenomenon."
"A glass ceiling bars women from advancement in the professions, administration and politics."
"Women constitute the overwhelming majority of the one billion people who are illiterate and who live in the most extreme poverty, and decisions affecting women are still made by men."
"It is high time that, in the course of the Beijing + 5 Conference in June, concrete decisions are taken which will actually result in the objectives of the Beijing Action Platform being realised."
"The report we are voting on tomorrow emphasises that progress within all twelve areas is necessary if women are fully to be able to obtain their share of human rights."
"A threefold strategy is needed if the Conference is not just to be another exercise in rhetoric."
"First of all, the world' s governments must adopt a concrete action plan and again undertake to fulfil the Beijing objectives."
"Secondly, they must pledge financial resources with a view to implementing the decisions and, thirdly, supervisory tools must be created for the purpose of monitoring implementation."
"These three tools have so far been missing in implementing the Beijing Action Platform."
"The fact that the world' s governments refuse to acknowledge that, from the cradle to the grave, girls and women are exploited and persecuted has, throughout the ages, been the most flagrant and far-reaching violation of human rights."
"This is something which the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities wants to change."
"Women should not just bear half the sky on their shoulders, but also have the right to take responsibility for decisions affecting our entire earth."
"Is that not so, Commissioner?"
"Mr President, we are going to New York first and foremost to discuss the position of women globally."
"Naturally, there is a need in the European Union, too, to improve the position of women in all walks of life, but we are now talking more about a worldwide conference."
"In my opinion, a worthwhile contribution to this event would be the concept that the empowerment of women can be regarded as a strategy for the development of society as a whole."
"By investing in women, we will be helping whole communities and societies on the road to development."
"The evidence in support of this is very convincing; many problems can be overcome by investing, for example, in the primary health care of women."
"In the eradication of poverty, supporting women, for example by 'micro loans' (negligible amounts from our point of view) has proved a very sound strategy for promoting economic activity."
"Education and training are, of course, the means for women to become members of full standing in society."
"I believe that if there is anything we in the European Union can contribute to this conference, it would relate to the fact that we have launched this 'gender mainstreaming' process, which entails trying to involve the gender viewpoint in all decision making."
"As all those present are well aware, this is not easy - we have a tremendous amount of work to do in this respect ourselves - but we can raise the issue that the role of women needs to be reassessed when it comes to questions of war and peace, for example."
"Women are, to a very great extent, the victims and those who suffer in wars now."
"Would it not be a good idea to debate what could be done by women to prevent or resolve these kind of present-day conflicts?"
"Five years ago, at the Beijing Conference, it was stated that women' s rights are human rights."
"We quite agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Smet. We cannot accept what is happening to women in Afghanistan and we must promote the human rights of women at the New York Conference."
"Mr President, we support the foundation work carried out by the co-rapporteurs, we support their approach and we support the fact that sound proposals continue to be produced, but when it comes to evaluating what has been achieved over the last five years - as has been said - we have no information, in either objective or more general terms, to provide a basis for planning new actions or finding means of rectifying failed past actions."
"The European Commission will once again, therefore, be conspicuous for its grand proposals and the failure to follow them up with tangible actions."
"In our opinion, on this occasion, it might be appropriate for the Union to adopt an initiative, a practical initiative which is a priority objective with set time frames."
"We feel that, out of the vast amount of issues to be considered, female circumcision warrants particular attention."
"We would like Mrs Diamantopoulou to inform us whether the clause on relations with third countries which deals with female circumcision is seen as particularly important and, in the interests of bringing the matter to a swift conclusion, we suggest that no further Union aid should be granted to any of those countries which permit or tolerate female circumcision."
"This is a major issue, a practice so common and widespread that it is featuring increasingly, even in the European daily media."
"- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I should like, as we are discussing the action platform on equality decided in Beijing in 1995, to take this opportunity to extol the role played, and the efforts made, by the UN on this issue and to remind the House of the important role played and the contribution made by the Union in adopting a common accepted action platform at worldwide level."
"In view of the forthcoming UN conference in New York, I think it is opportune that we claim a more active and effective European and worldwide policy in all sectors, a policy which will reach as far as Afghanistan and the Gulf states, where women are still in a most unfortunate position and are denied fundamental human rights."
"This does not, of course, mean that we underestimate the progress achieved and the European Union' s contribution to the dynamic presence of women in all professional and scientific circles, the performance of women at all levels of education and their successes wherever equal opportunity policies and the principle of meritocracy are applied."
"However, despite the undisputed progress being made, serious problems of inequality and discrimination persist and have serious repercussions on the functioning of democracy and the failure to make full use of the valuable human resource which women represent comes at a huge economic and social cost."
"This is why we need to move forward with a specific vision and specific plan, with strategies and mechanisms, with a precise timetable and indicators, with quantifiable targets so that we can appraise the preceding decade and accurately evaluate the progress made at the new UN Conference in 2005."
"Today we need to extend our action to eradicate discrimination on the labour market, involve women in social dialogue and deal with violence against women."
"We need to guarantee a fair redistribution of responsibilities and obligations between the two sexes, both in public and private life."
"In short, we need to create a new institutional and social framework which reflects the changes which have taken place and which solves the problems and contradictions which arise from the new contract with the two sexes."
"The European Union and the Member States must be on the front line of this fight."
"- (EL) Mr President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Gröner and Mrs Smet on their exceptional and remarkable report."
"Apart from the 28 specific recommendations, which are particularly helpful, both for Beijing and the Commission' s fifth programme - and I should like to assure you that complete account will be taken of them - I must also highlight the fact that they are accompanied by a particularly interesting political analysis containing information and views which is an excellent tool and which I think the Member States would be well advised to reproduce."
"Five years on from Beijing, we shall be assessing the past five years."
"As the speakers have said, a great deal has been done and a great deal remains to be done."
"And, of course, Afghanistan will have to be discussed and reported and voted on in New York because it is one of the worst disgraces of our century, one of the worst disgraces of mankind in the year 2000."
"We made commitments in 1995; these commitments have been honoured up to a point and we shall be analysing them in full at the Beijing Conference."
"One question which arises is whether or not we have the information needed at European Union level."
"I should like to inform you that the Commission has been endeavouring for a long time now to collate information on all the Member States, to obtain answers to questionnaires sent out more than once, to obtain answers to individual issues of legislation, infrastructures, action and statistics."
"We have managed, after a great deal of trouble, I must admit, to collate a set of data and we shall be publishing a paper as quickly as possible - within a fortnight I hope - containing the data for 1999."
"That was the reason for the delay."
"As far as the report is concerned, I should like to refer to three points which, according to the questionnaires sent in from the countries of Europe, take priority there."
"The first is new changes in the information society."
"The new changes, which are changing the economy, society and the work model, are throwing up both huge challenges and huge problems, especially for the weaker groups, and huge problems for women, who are less involved in the new world of technologies and who, of course, have higher unemployment rates."
"We therefore need here to highlight the new objective of education, lifelong learning, retraining and special programmes to ensure that women participate in the new information society and, hence, in the labour market."
"The second point concerns democracy and is linked to the information society, which is creating a new type of communication between citizens and politicians and opening up a new route, which you need to be aware of and for which you need the right vehicle."
"And, of course, there is the traditional problem of the representation of women, which all the speakers have already touched on."
"The third point, which also proved to be the issue to which the Member States attach importance, is the issue of violence against women, the most important problem being trafficking in women, i.e. the modern version of the slave trade."
"Unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, we must assume that the new era is bringing with it not only electronic commerce, as defined in the economy, but also electronic commerce in women and children."
"These are issues which call, of course, for innovative solutions and new approaches and cannot simply be seen as the price paid for the new era."
"I think that these are the basic points which need to be assessed and, more importantly, where we need to renew our commitments."
"I should like to stress that Beijing will obviously give rise to negotiating problems."
"I agree that there will be centres of power and organised powers which will try to reverse all this progress and review the agenda which we have agreed on."
"How we organise ourselves at all levels and how our lobby operates at all levels are extremely important, because we want to prevent any review of the agenda or a return to the past, renew our commitments and create new momentum so that our commitments are implemented in the new era."
"I think that, since all negotiations depend on preparation and on being fully aware of one' s own situation and the situation of those sitting on the opposite side of the table, we at the Commission and the European Parliament need to cooperate very closely with the Portuguese Presidency."
"It is, I think, superfluous, to assure you that the Commission - and I personally - am at the disposal of the Portuguese Presidency so that we can prepare for these negotiations in the best possible way."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"I would, by the way, like to congratulate all Members who are still present on their perseverance and I would also like to extend warm thanks to the staff who are still present for their prolonged efforts."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.53 p.m.)"
"Address by Mr Kuçan, President of the Republic of Slovenia"
"In my capacity as President of the European Parliament, it is my honour and my very great pleasure to welcome Mr Milan Kuçan, President of the Republic of Slovenia."
"This is the first time that we have had the opportunity to welcome you here, Mr President, and I am very pleased to do so."
"Just ten years ago, on 8 April 1990, the first free, democratic elections were held in Slovenia, a high point in the Slovene spring."
"This spring contained the seeds of the confrontations and tensions of the summer of 1991, during which Slovenia won its independence."
"We are all, of course, still mindful of the images of those ten dramatic days in the summer of 1991."
"At that time, the courage, love of freedom and determination of the Slovene people and their President eventually prevailed over the threats of violence."
"And a free and democratic Slovenia was born."
"This event at the same time marked a return to the shared European values of peace and freedom, democracy and respect for human rights."
"These essential values of our European civilisation form the inalienable foundation for our joint actions, present and future."
"The European Union is first and foremost a Community based on values."
"I am pleased to see that after several decades of Communist dictatorship, Slovenia has enshrined these values as the foundations of the State."
"And now Slovenia belongs to the greater European family which we hope to bring together in the near future."
"In 1996, the Association Agreement enabled us to set up a joint European Parliament/Slovene Parliament parliamentary committee."
"On 10 June 1996, your country submitted its formal application for membership of the European Union."
"Negotiations began in March 1998, and I am aware that they are actively continuing under the leadership of the President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi, and Commissioner Verheugen."
"We are aware that over the last ten years, in your capacity as President of Slovenia, you have played a key role in achieving positive development in your country."
"I am therefore particularly pleased to welcome you here today."
"You are most welcome, Mr President, and without further ado I shall give you the floor."
"- Madam President, honourable Members, I am honoured to be able to speak in this august House."
"I am especially pleased that this has been made possible for me on the 50th anniversary of Robert Schuman' s appeal to France, Germany and other countries to enter into a common economic policy on steel and coal."
"That was the day when the process of European integration began."
"It is your and our common European day of celebration, and I offer you my sincere congratulations."
"I congratulate you with trust and faith in the European idea of association."
"I am confirmed in this faith by the recent very successful visit by the distinguished President of the European Parliament, Mrs Fontaine, to Slovenia."
"In her address to the Slovene Parliament, Mrs Fontaine expressed her clear commitment to furthering the project of a united Europe, saying: ""It is important that we support the will to strengthen the special features of each of our countries."
"We must therefore deepen the foundations of the European Union and prepare it for enlargement in such a way that it will be able tomorrow to maintain all its ability to function in response to challenges both internal and external."
"This will be possible only on condition that we maintain the existing balance between the small and large countries, and continue on the path towards a Europe of citizens"" ."
"This idea seems to me particularly important, for it emphasises coexistence."
"Coexistence is the only real alternative for the future of humankind; including that of Europe."
"Yet the question is: what will coexistence be founded upon?"
"My own firm conviction is that it should be founded, first and foremost, upon the experience we have brought with us and which has engendered the values that we have articulated as the quintessence of European democracy and declared as the principles binding together the very fabric of the new Europe."
"The experience we carry into the third millennium is an experience of the rise and fall of colonial powers and ideological, political and social totalitarianism."
"Set in counterpart to this, yet an integral part of our experience, is the ultimate establishment of the rule of law and human rights, the freedom of individuals and nations, democracy as the criterion of political power, social justice and stability as the goals to which we must constantly aspire."
"Alongside experience, our coexistence should be founded upon a set of laws that will determine human life on the threshold of the third millennium and in which these values will be implemented and confirmed."
"These are the laws of the global community."
"For the moment, the global community seems limited to markets, economies and information and communication technology."
"Politics is lagging behind this trend."
"Yet the solid foundations of coexistence in the world demand globalised politics, which will be capable of establishing social coherence which will balance the effects of capital which has already been globalised."
"Globalised politics presupposes that national politics and interests founded on the sovereignty of the nation state should be bound to the global politics of common responsibility."
"This would be a kind of world 'domestic politics' , to which all countries would be bound."
"It would be founded in part on the following elements: on the global spread of political and economic democracy, on binding standards of individual and collective human rights, on dialogue between different cultures, religions and civilisations, on opposition to nationalism and xenophobia, on a new balance between the economically developed and developing parts of the world, on the globalisation of learning, knowledge, research and information, on developing international and inter-regional cooperation, on constructing a social order based on the model of social justice and solidarity, on common security and defence and on the fight against organised crime."
"With such politics we might seek a way of ensuring that the former ideological, political and military confrontations of the Cold War are not replaced by clashes of culture, religion and civilisation."
"If we are to move towards worldwide political responsibility, we should be moving all the sooner to a policy of common responsibility in Europe; in the very Europe that right now is consolidating the foundations of coexistence for the future."
"This is being heralded by common European policies - not only monetary, but also foreign, defence and security policies - the European human rights charter, and perhaps a future European constitution."
"It is also heralded by the efforts to set up crisis management, which would prevent external or internal crises of countries in the region spilling over into armed conflict and aggression that might threaten the common peace, security and prosperity."
"A global policy of common responsibility requires not only that we prevent the actions of others that harm the community, but also, and most importantly, that we refrain from such actions."
"In the open, multipolar world where Eurocentrism is no more, Europe can be one of the standard-bearers of civilised development only if it is internally globalised, only if all of its parts are integrated within it, and if no one is excluded from the common future or marginalised."
"In the ruins of the Berlin Wall, however, traces of new divisions are appearing in Europe."
"In real life, several Europes exist. Here we have the countries of the European Union and members of Nato, which are developing on the basis of the long European democratic tradition, on respect for human rights and the prospects of a new economic upswing, complete with a common European currency."
"This grouping also includes some small countries that have experienced major developments within the EU and have preserved their special features."
"The second Europe is one of countries that are negotiating with the European Union: countries, therefore, that are in the first or second-class waiting rooms for the European train."
"The third Europe is made up of the countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania, Macedonia and Moldova), which have not yet reached the station, although they wish to do so."
"Some of them will not get there without help."
"There also exists a group of countries that, for the moment, do not wish to join the EU."
"They would prefer to toy with the project of a new ideological division of Europe."
"We may call this the fourth Europe."
"Serbia, poised to tip the scales of stability in South-Eastern Europe, has been thrust into that fourth Europe by its aggressive national political elite, which has, from time to time, been supported by the nationalist ambitions of political elites from other Balkan nations."
"As it decides on the lasting foundations of peace and also, following the horrors of war in the Balkans, on the future of Kosovo and Montenegro, European unity again faces a great test."
"The possibility of bloody military clashes is still real."
"This unity will be all the more vital when Serbia needs to be helped in the process of democratic change, when it will be faced with the truth and with its own responsibility."
"This change will open up the field of democratic, plural politics and efforts to bring the European value system back into the consciousness of the Serbian people."
"It will then be necessary for Serbia - and for other Balkan countries, too - to be presented with the challenging but realistic prospect of entry into European integration; and presented to each country on the same conditions, without special favours, but for this reason requiring all the more assistance."
"None of these 'Europes' is immune from political or cultural diversions, which might distort their democratic image, not even the first Europe."
"I have in mind the crude forms of xenophobia and hatred of foreigners, resistance to free movement of labour, and anti-Semitism, all of which are part of today' s political populism."
"This puts pressure on fundamental values, and threatens coexistence and our common future."
"Insensitivity to these phenomena would create new barriers between us."
"We are reminded of this by the experience we carry with us."
"I believe that the reservations of certain European countries towards the position of the Austrian Freedom Party are motivated by this experience and that this response will be consistent, irrespective of who might be affected by it."
"Alongside all the old divisions, new ones are emerging, and they are even more radically afflicting Europe, for the information society of today' s world is presenting challenges to every facet of our lives."
"There are ever increasing signs of the emergence of two classes in society."
"The world is beginning to divide in a new way."
"On the one hand, there are the unemployed and those who, through inadequate knowledge, have no access to modern information technology."
"They are threatened with social exclusion, stagnation and marginalisation."
"On the other hand, there are those who have the necessary education and are therefore guaranteed a future."
"This is a new phenomenon, which was identified recently at the EU Conference in Lisbon on social cohesion."
"It is clear that, today, everyone in Europe is faced with the same problems, and we are all responding to them."
"Of course, we are not responding in entirely the same way."
"Nevertheless, it is essential that in seeking answers we all proceed from the same value system."
"The common cornerstones of values for coexistence have been established."
"Now everyone must be afforded the chance to live in accordance with those values."
"Decisive importance in this may probably be ascribed to the new feeling of commitment to Europe, which I understand as a Europe-wide system of human ties, cooperation, solidarity, respect and other values."
"This does not simply involve the free flow of ideas, labour, goods and capital, but also values such as respect for diversity, tolerance, equality before the law of the 'citizens of Europe' , irrespective of their national, ethnic and cultural affiliation or outlook."
"This will enable a high level of identification with the same values across Europe, which, in turn, may represent the basic connective tissue of Europe."
"This frame of mind would be the best guarantee that intolerance and enmity remain a marginal phenomenon."
"At the same time, it would mean that in no European country could those in power dare, in the name of sovereignty or the principle of non-interference in internal affairs, to systematically stifle or limit either individual or collective human rights."
"Such an event would demand common action, without wavering or compromise."
"The NATO intervention in Kosovo is perhaps the first step in this direction."
"The value of fundamental human rights was placed above the value of classic state sovereignty."
"The systematic mass violation of human rights should henceforth not simply be the internal affair of an individual country."
"It is becoming a subject of responsibility for the international community."
"Whether this marks the beginning of a new chapter in international relations and international law, only time will tell."
"Europe, and in particular the EU, should not be in two minds about this."
"The real path of globalisation for Europe is the enlargement of the European Union to cover all European countries."
"This is a challenging enterprise, for a period of enlargement of the European Union is now beginning to include countries that have a different political 'pedigree' from the current members."
"Now it is the turn of countries that, in the great division of the world, belonged to the former ideological East of Europe."
"It is the turn of countries that, because of this, have lagged behind in their economic development."
"Yet the fact is that only this enlargement will mean the actual integration and globalisation of Europe, and will mean for the European East and West an end to the past and for both the beginning of a global European future."
"For those countries, like Slovenia, that were forcibly removed by the bloc system to a different culture, inclusion in European integration would also represent proof that they had finally returned to their western civilisation."
"In any case, we should not forget that these countries, including Slovenia, have shown that in a relatively short time they have been able to adopt the rules that have taken a relatively long time to become established in the EU and in the European West."
"The great efforts invested in reforms may serve as a guarantee that EU enlargement will be beneficial, both for the current members and for those that wish to become members."
"Holding back this enlargement would indicate that Europe has still not buried the past, that it has not learned sufficiently from history, and that globalisation is not yet its internal requirement."
"It would also indicate that Europe is abandoning its influence and presence in the world."
"Alongside this new qualitative step forward, doubts are emerging among the members of the EU."
"They are moving from the entirely known to the not entirely known."
"The decision on enlargement carries with it entirely new risks; and there must be a degree of understanding for the dilemma facing the EU."
"I am thinking primarily of the implementation of serious internal, institutional and substantive reforms in the EU, of its readiness to accept new members and of postponement of the date of enlargement."
"Could it be perhaps that once again the special interests of individual Member States are rising to the surface?"
"Does changing the view on successive acceptance of new countries, as soon as they are ready to be accepted, into a view on group acceptance of candidates in a first and second round, not mean a renewed shifting of enlargement towards the end of this first decade?"
"Dilemmas, doubts and uncertainties are also emerging among the candidate countries."
"The impression is growing of a 'moving target' , which is shifting and dampening the enthusiasm of the better prepared candidates with the feeling that they will have to wait for the less-prepared candidates."
"Clarity and transparency of these views would, of course, have an encouraging effect, and it would be especially useful if everyone could stop trying to offer each other excuses."
"The EU should not use the problems among the candidate countries as an excuse to delay its own reforms, while the candidate countries should not use the difficulties of EU internal reforms as an excuse for putting off the reforms they need for full membership."
"Such excuses would slow down the prospects of the rise of the future Europe, and making enlargement conditional upon bilateral demands and the interests of individual countries would have no less an effect."
"This includes conditions that go far back into history and attempt to revise it, particularly the history of the Second World War."
"Such demands are appearing from the position of power held by those that are in the European Union, against the powerlessness of those that are only just exercising the right to acceptance into the European Union."
"At this point I would like to recall my address of November 1995 to the Committee on Foreign Policy, Security and Defence of your Parliament in its previous composition."
"At that time, I argued against the discriminatory treatment of Slovenia, for the then Italian Government was preventing us, through its power of veto, from signing the association agreement, and was setting as a condition the resolving of what were for Italy issues in dispute deriving from the border treaties between Italy and the former Yugoslavia."
"With its back to the wall, Slovenia signed the so-called 'Spanish compromise' ."
"I do not mention this episode to resurrect memories, but rather because in the current negotiations there have also appeared tendencies to raise purportedly justified interests in relation to Slovenia to the level of an EU demand."
"I am thinking of the demand for restitution of property to those from whom it was appropriated following the Second World War as part of the punishing of collaboration with the Nazi and Fascist occupation regime."
"In the then Yugoslavia, Slovenia did nothing that was not done in the spirit of the Potsdam resolutions by the Allies, with whom the Slovenes fought together against Fascism and Nazism."
"This time, Slovenia does not wish to accept this kind of imposition of conditions, and expects understanding and sympathy from the European Union."
"I believe that individual bilateral issues should not, in any event, be allowed to become a reason for placing conditions on acceptance as a full member of the EU; nor should they be allowed to gain the pragmatic support of EU members, for the sake of clear and open foundations in European integration and in its future."
"Slovenia is a small nation."
"For many centuries we lived in a multinational political community, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and in two Yugoslavias."
"We felt all the anguish of non-respect for national identity, of pressures towards our national identity being wiped out and of the fatal consequences of inequality in society and before the law."
"The worst thing of all was the aggression during the time of the Nazi and Fascist occupation."
"Our right to existence as a nation was taken away."
"For this reason we value highly the efforts of those carrying forward the project of a common European home, founded on the concept of open autonomy of national and other entities of society."
"Life in diversity is the key to success for European association, and Slovenia has tied its future to this."
"Our historical experiences and the future of our citizens dictate that we cannot reconcile ourselves either to voluntary or forced isolation from Euro-Atlantic institutions."
"Slovenia wishes to be a part of them, and is prepared to contribute what it can to the common life of European nations, but is not prepared to pay an inequitable price for it."
"Slovenia will be ready for accession by the end of 2002, and believes that it will then be welcome in the club of EU Member States."
"We are also pleased that, in Helsinki, the Member States of the EU committed themselves to enlargement by the same date for those candidate countries best prepared."
"In order for the current goals to be achieved, negotiations should be concluded next year."
"We are convinced that the current progress in negotiations should make this possible."
"I would like finally to stress that I do not see globalisation and European integration as unification."
"The positive effects of these processes are interdependent on the simultaneously establishing freedom of individuation and fragmentation."
"This is not just the freedom and autonomy of the individual, but also the freedom of social groups to express ethnic, cultural, religious, political and spiritual affiliations and convictions."
"These freedoms have a special meaning in people' s lives, and through them people express their bond with specific values."
"Only respect for such freedoms can be the foundation of European coexistence."
"This involves establishing the principle of 'unity in diversity' ."
"The alternative is clear."
"If we do not succeed in finding in this new millennium the foundations of coexistence, which cannot simply be a negation of the past, but also an active acceptance of the future, including the formulation of a universal European policy of common responsibility in an open European Union, Europe will direct its destiny back into the past instead of into the future."
"In the first decade of the new century and millennium, democratic Europe is also facing new trials."
"My firm conviction is that united Europeans could be more than a match for these trials."
"Madam President, I wholeheartedly support Mr Buttiglione' s speech and, on behalf of the Forza Italia delegation of which I am head in the European People' s Party, I cannot forget the suffering of the Italian people in the former Yugoslavia at the end and during the immediate aftermath of the Second World War."
"A genuine ethnic cleansing operation took place and disputes still remain which have not been resolved."
"Some Italian citizens are still waiting for their rights to be respected."
"We are on extremely good terms with Slovenia, but we cannot forget past events or allow them to be forgotten."
"The Europe which is just emerging, our common home which we are building together, cannot disregard the past."
"We cannot create a Europe which does not condemn the atrocities perpetrated by Communism and Nazism."
"Therefore, Madam President, in addition to calling upon you to make authoritative representations to the Slovenian Government, I also invite all the Members of Parliament to sign the declaration calling for the institution of a day dedicated to the Shoah, to the holocaust, to be observed throughout the European Union."
"Madam President, we know President Kuçan and we are aware of his regard for Europe and the good relations which have been established between Italy and Slovenia."
"We do not feel there is cause for concern but we would certainly like the matter to be clarified, and I would like to say that we regard the Spanish compromise managed by Mr Solana as non-negotiable."
"Clearly, there is no question mark over any of this, and, therefore, I also consider that it would be appropriate for you to obtain clarification of the issue."
"We entrust the matter to your wisdom and authority."
"Thank you, Mrs Napoletano."
"I propose to the three speakers that I write to Mr Kuçan to inform him very respectfully of your remarks. I should probably also give him a very precise account of your interventions."
"I believe that these reflect the feelings of a large part of this House. Thank you for trusting me to inform Mr Kuçan of this situation as precisely and clearly as possible."
"Statements by the President"
"I have two statements to make."
"You should already have received the first one by e-mail. This concerns the practical problems encountered on some of Parliament' s premises."
"The Quaestors acted quickly to resolve this situation in the best way possible."
"They commissioned air analyses from the German company, Dekra, which identified certain failures which we have remedied as quickly as possible."
"I thank the Quaestors, and particularly the President of the College, Mr Poos, for their prompt action."
"I myself immediately wrote to the Strasbourg authorities and the social services so that all the relevant authorities were informed."
"You should therefore have received this statement by e-mail."
"Madam President, it is totally unacceptable that a building that cost millions of pounds, and which was officially opened less than six months ago, has thousands of faults and is now found to be a potential threat to the people who work in it."
"I trust that this problem will be raised in the negotiations for the final price of the building, which should strengthen Parliament' s hand in reducing the cost for the taxpayers of Europe."
"My second statement concerns the information sent to me by the French Government regarding the receipt of a decree withdrawing the mandate of Mr Le Pen."
"You will remember that I informed the House at the time that I would ask the Legal Affairs Committee, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, to give an opinion on this issue."
"This committee has, on several occasions, examined all the aspects, particularly the legal ones, of this issue."
"I thank Mrs Palacio, the committee' s chairperson, and the committee members for their efforts."
"The discussions were extremely thorough and it was only yesterday, at 8 p.m., that I received Mrs Palacio' s letter informing me of the committee' s opinion on this issue."
"So that there is no room for error or misinterpretation, I would prefer to read you the letter."
"'Madam President, during its meeting of 16 May 2000, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market re-examined the situation of Mr Le Pen."
"The committee is aware that the decree of the Prime Minister of the French Republic, of which Mr Le Pen was notified on 5 April 2000, and which was published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 22 April 2000, has become enforceable."
"However, the committee has also noted, as mentioned in the letter notifying Mr Le Pen of the decree, that the latter has the option of appealing to the French Council of State."
"This appeal may be accompanied by a request to suspend the enforcement of the decree."
"In view of the decision taken the day before not to recommend at present that Parliament officially take note of the decree regarding Mr Le Pen, the committee has examined the possible responses."
"The case of Mr Tapie was mentioned as a precedent to be followed in support of this decision. The result is that the European Parliament should officially take note of the decree withdrawing Mr Le Pen' s mandate only after expiry of the deadline for appealing to the French Council of State or, if applicable, after a decision by the latter' ."
"These are the contents of the letter sent to me yesterday evening by Mrs Palacio on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Once again, I thank her."
"I intend to abide by the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Madam President, I am taking the floor to request that Parliament express its opinion in accordance with Rule 7(4) of the Rules of Procedure."
"If you will allow me, I will justify my proposal."
"Go ahead, Mr Barón Crespo."
"Madam President, Rule 7(4) of the Rules of Procedure lays down that the President may ask the competent committee for its opinion and that Parliament may express its opinion on the basis of that proposal."
"I would ask Parliament to express its view, and I do so with all due respect for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal Market, which has held a full debate on this issue, because I believe that there are two basic elements here."
"One of them is respect for parliamentary rules and the Treaties."
"Monday' s letter from the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee - which is the one I know, because I have just been made aware of it - cited Article 12(2) of the 1976 Act concerning the election of representatives of the European Parliament, which reads as follows: ""Where a seat falls vacant pursuant to national provisions in force in a Member State, the latter shall inform the European Parliament, which shall take note of the fact"" ."
"This means, firstly, that a Member State, which is a constitutional state, like France, has taken decisions in accordance with a legal judgement and the executive..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I am going to suspend the sitting for a few moments as it seems that one of our colleagues is feeling ill."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.20 a.m. and resumed at 10.40 a.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Staes has just been taken ill."
"Apparently it does not seem to be a heart problem and is therefore hopefully not too serious but an ECG is going to be carried out straightaway."
"I can therefore reassure you, relatively speaking, about his state of health."
"I thank the two Members who are doctors for taking immediate action and for giving me this information."
"I must also say that this unfortunate incident has regrettably shown the length of time which it takes for the medical services to arrive."
"This sort of thing could happen to any of us so we definitely need to do something."
"I am going to give the floor to Mrs Banotti who wishes to speak straightaway so that the Quaestors can take steps to ensure that the facilities are exactly as they should be."
"Madam President, we have all been deeply distressed by the illness of our colleague."
"I am immensely relieved that he appears not to be as ill as he appeared at the beginning."
"I am a nurse which is why I went up to see if I could give assistance."
"We have to recognise that, particularly when the weather gets as hot as it did this week, colleagues' health is under a great deal of stress."
"It is unfortunate that it took a considerable time to get the stretcher to take Mr Staes out of the Chamber."
"I would propose on behalf of colleagues that we have immediate resuscitation equipment here in the Chamber in case such a distressing event occurs again."
"I am very glad that he is not as ill as he looked, but we must have resuscitative equipment in the House, given not only the conditions but some of our ages and I include myself in that."
"Many colleagues are finding it particularly difficult this week in the heat."
"Thank you, Mrs Banotti."
"I believe there are no age limits for this type of illness."
"Madam President, together with the other MEPs who were present during the moments after our colleague fell ill, I must say in all fairness that the time that passed between the incident occurring and the arrival of the doctor would be classed as admirable for any of the world' s institutions."
"And when the official doctor, who came equipped with all the appropriate resuscitation equipment - and in this respect I agree with my colleague - ordered the stretcher, the stretcher arrived."
"I am very satisfied with the time that was taken and the action of Parliament' s medical services."
"Madam President, maybe at long last we will decide that the Medical Services should not be placed in the basement."
"They would prefer to be on the same floor as the plenary session and maybe we could actually look into that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we trust that the Quaestors will look into the matter."
"Madam President, I very much hope that Mr Staes will get well soon, but I believe that we should also remind and ask the media to inform our co-citizens that our life is not a bed of roses, and that coming and going like nomads is not the best thing for our health."
"However, we have all made a free choice."
"I will return to the issue we were discussing: my Group' s request for this House to express its opinion in accordance with the regulations."
"I was reading Article 12(2) of the Act of 1976, which is the legal basis cited by the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee in her letter of Monday."
"This paragraph says: ""Where a seat falls vacant pursuant to national provisions in force in a Member State, the latter shall inform the European Parliament, which shall take note of the fact"" ."
"France is a constitutional state."
"There has been a legal judgement, a government decree, which has been communicated to us and I believe it falls to the European Parliament to take note of it in accordance with the Treaties and with parliamentary law."
"I have heard - because I do not have first-hand knowledge of the letter - that precedents are cited."
"There certainly are precedents and my Group believes they should be respected."
"However, in this case, we should not cite the precedent of Mr Tapie for two reasons: firstly, he was ineligible for reasons of bankruptcy, and, secondly - and this is important - he had used his right to appeal."
"Here we have a case of ineligibility for one year and the right to appeal, recognised in the French decree, has not been used."
"I do not wish to enter into a debate on French law, since I have no knowledge of it."
"I believe that, in accordance with the Treaties and our Rules, Parliament must take note of the decision of the French State."
"This is the correct procedure and I think that, although I was not present in the Committee on Legal Affairs, the proposal does not reflect it."
"In any event, I believe that this proposal should not be ratified by the European Parliament, I am going to request that it be put to the vote and I would like to say that my Group will vote against it."
"Madam President, I am speaking as coordinator for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I was very surprised by the letter which you have just read from the chairperson of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Yesterday, I received a letter from the chairperson, which faithfully reflected what had happened in the Legal Affairs Committee: following a discussion, it was decided not to recommend that Parliament take note, leaving the issue on the table for further discussion."
"The letter which you have read reflects the personal motives which the chairperson and perhaps other MEPs put forward, but which does not reflect the point of view of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Specifically, the Socialist Group' s position was that, in view of the Act of 1976, all this Parliament could do is what Mr Barón just said, that is to say, take note (prendre acte) of the decision of the French Government, with no other condition."
"The possibility of giving an explanation was raised, and I argued that that would mean a new vote."
"No new vote took place and therefore - I repeat - the views expressed in the letter which you have just read reflect Mrs Palacio' s personal position and not the position of the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to say that, in any event, we are all aware that we are facing a situation in which we have to find our way with few specific points of reference and therefore, we must resort to analogy, precedent, common sense and, in general terms, the general principles of the law."
"This is because in our statutory law, in our Rules of Procedure, there is no explicit mention of how to proceed in a situation such as this."
"Secondly, I wish to point out that there is doubtless confusion here."
"Madam President, you have consulted the Legal Affairs Committee on the basis of a purely formal decision."
"As on other occasions, such as, for example, when the Legal Affairs Committee examines whether or not to lodge an appeal in the Court of Justice, we are talking about a purely technical assessment by an internal body of Parliament, which makes a recommendation to the President, the external body of Parliament, who is expected to take the decision."
"I respect what Mr Barón Crespo says."
"His views were discussed and examined in depth by the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Allow me to refer to what was said in this committee."
"Firstly, Mr Barón says that there is no similarity with the Tapie case because the ineligibility in that case stemmed from a bankruptcy and in this case it stems from a criminal conviction."
"I do not personally share that view, and I believe that, according to the relevant law, there are reasons not to share it, because, in any event, we are talking about two sentences, both from French courts and both leading to ineligibility."
"It makes no sense now to look into the reason for the sentence."
"The sentence exists."
"The fact that it involves ineligibility is what concerns us."
"Mr Barón' s second argument concerning the difference between the cases related to the fact that Mr Le Pen has not lodged an appeal and that Mr Tapie had."
"I do not share this view either, and nor did the majority of the Legal Affairs Committee, because Mr Le Pen is still within the time limit for lodging an appeal."
"We therefore cannot go against something, to which he is entitled under French law: to lodge an appeal within a certain time limit."
"Please allow me now to refute Mr Medina' s statement on his interpretation of the matter."
"I would like to do this calmly, although I consider it to be absolutely unjustified and to warrant a more forceful response."
"However, in my capacity as chairperson, I must point out that the two letters are complementary."
"In the first letter, Madam President, you were informed that the Legal Affairs Committee had taken a decision not to take note of the judgement for the moment, bearing in mind that it is not final. It is enforceable but not final."
"In the second paragraph it said: ""tomorrow we will continue to discuss this issue"" ."
"The second letter refers to what happened at the second meeting and all the members of the Legal Affairs Committee know that that was how I presented it."
"In no way was there any intention to hold a vote, but simply a discussion. I personally, as rapporteur, was going to propose a basis for discussion."
"There was therefore no place for a vote on the issue and I had stated that on the previous day."
"The vote had already taken place in the Legal Affairs Committee."
"Madam President, I did inform you of what happened in that debate and why it did not continue, and it did not do so basically because there was insistence on the issue of the Tapie case."
"Clearly, the Legal Affairs Committee can vote on anything, but since it was not laid down and since it was dealing with such an important and serious issue which did not appear in the agenda, it did not seem to me to be reasonable to hold a vote if we were taking a route which all the speakers - and this is recorded in the Minutes - for one reason or another, rejected."
"Furthermore, the Minutes also show that I said that a committee chairperson rarely obtained such a degree of unanimity with regard to a proposal."
"I say this in order to refute these statements."
"I would now like to make a comment in relation to the Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, Rule 7(4) is being cited."
"That paragraph - in the event that we had to resort to it, which I do not believe to be the case, and I will explain why - states that Parliament may express its opinion on a proposal."
"Madam President, there is no proposal to the plenary here."
"I believe that, in order to vote honestly, on an issue as delicate as this, if Parliament has to vote, a report should be produced in accordance with the rules, so that everybody may vote as they see fit, and not be influenced by allegations from one side or the other, bearing in mind that, in actual fact, the majority of MEPs are not aware of the background to this issue."
"Therefore, if the President wishes to take this route, a report by the Legal Affairs Committee is absolutely essential and it would be irregular not to proceed in that way,..."
"(Noise)"
"... for Parliament to express its opinion on an issue for which there is no written document or anything whatsoever, and which requires legal consideration at the highest level."
"It is absolutely irregular and contrary to the Rule that has been cited..."
"(Applause)"
"... because, Madam President, a majority in the Legal Affairs Committee considered, on purely legal bases, that we could not take note of this loss of MEP status."
"(Protests)"
"Madam President, in my opinion, furthermore, this article is not applicable, and I will tell you why: Parliament is asked to take note."
"It is in the nature of all decisions in plenary that they be taken from a political point of view. In this case we are talking about a purely formal legal assessment."
"Madam President, I believe that it falls to the President to take this decision, and you may consult the Rules of Procedure, which states that you must consult the Legal Affairs Committee."
"An analysis could be made of the reasons why the Legal Affairs Committee should be consulted, as the internal advisory body in this case. I am prepared to make this analysis, because I have done so before."
"(Protests)"
"Madam President, you can consult any other internal body and, in particular ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"... the Conference of Group Chairmen. However, the House cannot consider this proposal in these circumstances."
"(Protests and the President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, as one political group chairman has spoken, as is his right of course, I would also like to briefly make our Group' s position clear."
"The person in question holds political views most of which I find loathsome."
"But there are legal systems in the European Union and I would always defend the rights of all Members of the European Parliament under those legal systems."
"If legal proceedings are being taken against a Member of this House in a Member State, then we should await the outcome of those proceedings before we can make a final decision here."
"Mr Hänsch, if my information is correct, and I have not had a chance to talk to you about this, but I say this with all due respect to our former President, Klaus Hänsch, then our former President specifically made the same point in relation to the Tapie case, that is to say that we should await the outcome of the appeal procedure before we reach a decision here."
"What was right then cannot be wrong now."
"We must respect the rights of every individual Member of this House, whatever his political views are."
"My Group will always argue for that, even if the Members involved belong to other groups."
"We will defend these rights with equal vigour, because they are our common rights."
"If we violate the law, we can say goodbye to the European Union."
"That is why we respect and defend the law - no matter who it applies to."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the representatives of our group in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have familiarised themselves thoroughly with this matter, and I too represent our group in this Committee."
"We are fully aware of the political sensitivity of this issue."
"We do not, however, want this issue to be used against us for political purposes."
"Supported by a majority, our Group concluded that the opinion of the majority of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was justified."
"We must make it clear, however, that if there is to be a vote in the part-session on this matter, i.e. on whether the mandate of Mr Le Pen should be terminated, the majority of the French delegation in our Group will vote in favour of this termination."
"Mrs Hautala, we must be very clear on this."
"It is not a question of voting to waive anybody' s immunity."
"We are talking about Rule 7(4) based on which I asked the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a proposal."
"We now have this proposal and Rule 7(4) itself states that: ""On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter"" ."
"I have received a request for Parliament to adopt a position. In my opinion, I must logically, as a result of using this Rule, not put the committee' s opinion to the vote, but hold a vote to find out who wants us to vote on this opinion."
"Is this now clear to everyone?"
"(Interruption by Mrs Pack) Quite right, Mrs Pack, it is not a question of voting on the substance but of finding out whether or not this is an issue to be placed on the agenda."
"The House wants Parliament to adopt a position at midday on the opinion of the Legal Affairs Committee and it is understood that at that point we will see ..."
"(Mixed reactions)But the letter will be provided to you."
"I speak as the coordinator of the ELDR Group on the Legal Affairs Committee."
"The House should realise, from the fact that this matter has occupied our Committee for a period of three very long and exhaustive meetings, that it was felt to be a very complex and difficult issue to deal with."
"I for one would feel it wrong for this House to try to look at this matter in a hurry, which seems to be the proposal being put forward by Mr Barón Crespo."
"This is a case for absolute objectivity and attention to the rules."
"As I understand the rule in question, which, Madame President, you are carefully trying to construe, there is at the moment an opinion before you from the Legal Affairs Committee but there is not a proposal as such."
"The rule talks about Parliament having a right to give a view on a proposal, but it seems that you have merely an opinion, not a proposal."
"If we were to take a view as a full Parliament, then we should have something more in front of us and a great deal more time and careful consideration before we enter into such a hasty vote on an issue such as this."
"Madam President, this matter has been very badly handled from the start. This is to be regretted given the political impact it will have."
"You can get an idea of the confusion which reigned within the Legal Affairs Committee during the examination of this issue when someone like Mrs Hautala is under the impression that this is a question of waiving parliamentary immunity."
"This is not at all the case and it is in this climate of confusion within the committee that a roughly equal number of votes for and against were cast, hence this proposal."
"(Mixed reactions) This is what happened."
"I completely agree with Mr Poettering that the law must be respected: French law is what it is, however, whether you agree with it or not."
"In this situation, French law stipulates that the government must assume its responsibilities based on a judgement from a tribunal. In other words, it must publish the decree withdrawing the mandate and we unfortunately have no choice but to take note of this officially."
"Whether this is a good or bad thing, it is a situation which I felt I had to clarify."
"Madam President, I wish to raise a procedural motion."
"I must remind Mr Wurtz that a tribunal does not deliver judgements."
"A court delivers judgements."
"He should brush up on his legal knowledge."
"That apart, the Legal Affairs Committee rightfully discussed this issue and Mr Wurtz was not there."
"As a result, he is ill-placed to criticise a confusion which did not exist."
"There was political confusion but no legal confusion."
"The position of the Legal Affairs Committee was simple."
"The decision is not final and therefore cannot be accepted."
"That apart, if the President wants to consult the plenary, this should at least pertain to a specific report, as pointed out by the committee' s chairperson."
"We cannot properly discuss and vote at midday on such a politically complex issue when this complexity is based on an internal contradiction between texts in French criminal law, which is not easily accessible to the Members of this House, including the French Members."
"If you decide that a vote must be held in this Parliament, this cannot occur without a committee report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have received many requests to speak."
"We absolutely must find the best solution."
"I will read to you the letter that Mr Hänsch sent to Mr Hervé de Charrette, the then French Foreign Minister, at the time of the Tapie affair."
"The most important paragraph states that: ""Due to the irreversible nature of the withdrawal of the mandate, it seems to me appropriate to wait for the Council of State to rule on this appeal."
"It appears that the Council of State' s decision on the stay of execution will be taken imminently"" ."
"As you can see, and we cannot get into a discussion on this, I too looked at what my predecessors did in similar situations because case law does, rightfully, exist."
"We are now in a difficult position."
"I propose that we decide whether or not we want the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a genuine proposal, as some of you seem to think that the letter written to me by Mrs Palacio is not a proposal within the terms of the Rules of Procedure."
"Personally, I must abide by the Rules of Procedure which state that: ""On a proposal from that committee, Parliament may adopt a position on the matter"" ."
"If Parliament, therefore, wants a genuine proposal, we will ask the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up this proposal on which we can calmly vote, not at midday, but a little later perhaps."
"We must resolve this situation."
"I will therefore immediately put the two possible solutions to the vote."
"The first is that we keep to the current position which is to abide by the terms of Mrs Palacio' s letter and await the outcome of any appeal lodged with the Council of State by the Member in question, before officially noting the withdrawal or otherwise of the mandate."
"The second solution is that the plenary asks the Legal Affairs Committee to draw up a genuine proposal on which Parliament will adopt a position in accordance with Rule 7(4)."
"Madam President, I am sorry I need to ask to speak again, but we cannot vote on anything at all here today, because we have clear and proper procedures."
"If we refer a matter to a committee, then we must have a basis for doing so, that is to say we need a document defining that referral."
"We do not have such a document."
"That is why I urge you not to hold a vote on this matter now in any way whatsoever."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to Mr Barón Crespo and the Socialist Group."
"We have reached an impasse. I fully understand that you want Mr Le Pen to lose his mandate."
"Fortunately, however, this issue does not depend on our political desires but on the law and on the fact that, at the moment, we are faced with a legal situation which goes against what you are proposing and which is forcing us into a stalemate."
"The President is right."
"Either this is a legal proposal from the committee and we can vote on this basis or this is not a legal proposal, in which case you are asking for one to be drawn up."
"If you want a vote as an indication of our position, that is entirely up to you, but it would be wise to reject this as I believe there is a contradiction."
"I do not often agree with Mrs Garaud but in this case she is right."
"There is a contradiction in French law which states that a decision is not final and not suspensive."
"Understand that if you can, but it is up to the French Parliament to reform this law."
"In our opinion - and on this point, Mr Wurtz, I cannot agree with you - the French State, the Italian State and the German State are sovereign."
"The European Parliament is also sovereign and can adopt a position contrary to a state decision."
"This is my conception of Europe."
"In the current situation, I would simply ask you to say that we will wait and press for a decision by the Council of State as to whether or not Mr Le Pen' s request is suspensive."
"This can happen very quickly."
"This would not be a decision on the substance, even though it is purely a legal matter, but on the form."
"If the Council of State decides today that its decision is not suspensive, the European Parliament can, within 48 hours, take the necessary decision."
"I would therefore ask you to withdraw your request for a vote so that we do not reach a total impasse."
"Madam President, the first thing I wish to say is that I think it would be unworthy of the European Parliament to be at loggerheads over this issue."
"We should not be presenting the public with a spectacle of that kind."
"My second point is that you decided, on the basis of Rule 7(4), to consult the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"That is your right."
"However, if I have understood correctly, we do not have a proposal from the Legal Affairs Committee as a basis for a vote, but you did ask the Committee on Legal Affairs for its opinion."
"There is a legal problem here that only you can clear up."
"I have in mind the difference between Article 12 of the Act on the election of Members by direct universal suffrage and Rule 7(4) of our Rules of Procedure."
"There is a discrepancy here."
"My advice is that we need to clear up this discrepancy."
"That is your task, Madam President."
"There is nothing we can vote on until you have cleared this up with the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"(Applause)My advice is therefore that we should not hold a vote today, but that we should await your decision, Madam President."
"(Applause)"
"I agree with Mr Hänsch."
"I see that Mr Barón Crespo is applauding Mr Hänsch."
"I therefore assume that he agrees with Mr Cohn­Bendit and will withdraw his request as this is not a genuine proposal from the Legal Affairs Committee."
"This is the best solution for everyone."
"Equal treatment"
"The next item is the report (A5-0136/2000) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin [COM(1999) 0566 - C5-0067/2000 - 1999/0253(CNS)]."
"Madam President, the agenda features an extremely important report by Mrs Buitenweg, yet, with all due respect, we are going through it rather quickly."
"Especially given that we only voted on her report this week in the parliamentary committee, we have since had very little time to work on amendments for the plenary."
"But to make matters worse, I have to say that, in this case, Rule 115 applies, which states that, except in the cases of urgency referred to in Rules 50 and 112, a debate and vote shall not be opened on a text unless it was distributed at least 24 hours previously."
"The latter, Madam President, was unfortunately not the case."
"As I understand, the French version was still not available this morning."
"I suggest postponing the debate and vote on this extremely important report to the next part-session."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I wish to make three brief points."
"The first concerns the point of procedure addressed by Mr Oostlander, namely that various colleagues felt, because of the sensitivity of the issue in hand, that they should like to have in their own language, as is their right, the text of the report and all the amendments to it."
"This matter was signalled clearly at the Conference of Presidents last week - on more than one occasion, I understand."
"I myself was absent, but I have had this confirmed to me."
"In that case, when the sensitivity of the availability of documents was clearly signalled, why was it not prioritised by the services in such a way as to avoid this?"
"That is my first question."
"Given the sensitivity, the Bureau, the House and the Conference of Presidents should be given a detailed account of this breakdown in the system."
"My second point is that Mr Oostlander is perfectly within his rights to say that, under Rule 115, proceeding with the debate or the vote can be questioned as the documentation was not available 24 hours in advance."
"He is perfectly correct to insist on the application of that rule, if he should so wish."
"It is my understanding that all the documents and amendments in all languages were finally available about 3 p.m. yesterday."
"I should like to have that confirmed."
"If that is true, I should then like to suggest that we change our order of business for today and, respecting the 24-hour deadline, I would ask the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, to introduce her report at 3 p.m., followed by a debate, urgencies and then the vote, which would fully respect the 24-hour deadline."
"There is one point that, to many of us, is the issue of substance in this report."
"We have under the Treaties the power now to bring in new anti-discrimination legislation."
"Of all the areas of political sensitivity in contemporary Europe, that dealing with racism and xenophobia should be given the highest priority in this House."
"The Portuguese Presidency will organise a Social Affairs Council which we can engage with if we deliver a view."
"I appeal to the House to make creative use of the possibility open to us, in setting our agenda, to recognise this substantive political requirement and to facilitate a debate at 3 p.m. and a vote at 6 p.m. or thereafter this evening."
"Thank you, Mr Cox."
"Before giving the floor to the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, I can tell you that the report was available in all languages yesterday afternoon and that the amendments have only just become available."
"It is quite clear that we are not within the time limit established in Rule 115."
"Madam President, I am delighted with Mr Cox' s proposal and I think that it is also a viable compromise."
"I regret that the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have quoted Rule 115, because the last version of the text, which was the French one, was actually issued at 1.02 a.m."
"It is now 23.5 hours later."
"Maybe they need this last half hour to prepare for their debate, but it does seem that they seized on this as a rather lame excuse."
"However, I am in favour of the compromise of starting this debate at 3.00 p.m., and I also hope that we will be able to finish it this afternoon."
"I would like to point out once more that it is indeed extremely important to finish it during this sitting because, otherwise, we will lose all authority which we can still exercise in the Social Affairs Council, to be held on 5 and 6 June and, in that way, the report' s significance will be seriously undermined."
"Mr Poettering, the law affecting any given issue is subject to interpretation."
"I believe that the position adopted by Mr Cox - who formed a strategic majority with you in order to have Mrs Fontaine elected - is a compromise that makes it possible for everyone here to vote for a report on racism with their head held high."
"Opinions may be divided about Austria, but when it comes to making it clear what our position is on racism in Europe, we should not get bogged down in a formal debate as we did just now, we should make it plain that we are clear-thinking people."
"So I appeal to you to accept Mr Cox' s compromise so we can proceed with the debate with our heads held high."
"Please, I beg you!"
"The debate on this dossier in the committee I have the honour to chair has been an excellent example of cooperation between different committees in Parliament and indeed of cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council presidency."
"When it was voted in committee on Monday night, the text and all 200 amendments were available in all languages."
"I would like to repeat Mr Cox' s call and ask if you will give this House an assurance that there will be an inquiry into why the final text was not available in French until yesterday afternoon, more than 40 hours after it was adopted in committee."
"The fact is that the debate on this directive has been exemplary - it has been a credit to this Parliament and any attempt to delay that debate or to delay a vote would be a sordid political move for reasons of party political advantage."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to insist on Rule 115 and it is essential that it is checked how and when the translations were provided."
"However, in line with Mr Cox, I deem it slightly inconvenient if, for that reason, this text will be debated on Friday morning, because this will surely cause a moral dilemma for a number of people."
"That is another issue."
"Mr Oostlander, this situation clearly comes under Rule 115 and Mr Cox' s proposal takes account of this rule."
"If I have understood correctly, and the proposal is accepted by the rapporteur, he is proposing that we discuss this issue this afternoon and vote tomorrow, in which case the deadlines in Rule ..."
"Mr Cox, please restate your proposal as the deadlines in Rule 115 must be respected."
"Madam President, the proposal which I have made and I shall repeat is that we should consider holding the debate at 15.00 hrs followed by the urgency debate, followed by votes on the report, other reports that are completed in debate and urgencies this afternoon."
"We agree."
"I am now looking to see whether the deadlines would be respected in this case."
"They would."
"I therefore put Mr Cox' s proposal, as accepted by the rapporteur, to the vote."
"Madam President, yesterday my Group presented a request that all procedural questions related to this report should be subject to roll-call voting."
"I would ask you to accept this request."
"A roll-call vote is possible on this issue as the compromise proposed by Mr Cox respects the Rules of Procedure."
"(Parliament gave its assent) The debate on Mrs Buitenweg' s report will take place at 3 p.m."
"Mr President, just one specific question: when will the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance start, given that it was quite definitely and firmly set for 3 to 5.30 p.m.?"
"This really is a mess!"
"At what time will it start?"
"I have a right to know."
"Mr Posselt, considering the time necessary for the debate on Mrs Buitenweg' s report, the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance will take place at approximately 4.30 p.m."
"Trafficking in women"
"Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank everyone who has worked on this report, that is to say, all collaborators, but also the people from the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the interpreters, who have worked very hard."
"This report is also a reaction to the excellent communication by the Committee on new measures to fight trafficking in women."
"By way of preparing for the report, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities organised a public hearing which involved experts and the presence of a victim who came to give her story."
"A delegation of this committee, together with Mrs Diamantopoulou, visited a shelter for victims of trafficking in people."
"Moreover, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Member States and candidate countries received a questionnaire on how they tackle trafficking in women, the results of which will be made available to the European Commission."
"The report primarily aims to fight trafficking in women, but also in children and men, that is to say in people in general."
"Trafficking in children does exist, but they are used as adults."
"Men, too, are victims of trafficking in people and are sexually abused."
"In fact, the sex industry is not the only market on which the victims of such trafficking are sold."
"In Belgium, 40 percent of the victims end up on the labour market, in the textile, hotel and catering and fruit-picking industries, bakeries and the construction industry, or as house staff or au-pair girls, obliged to work as slaves in degrading conditions."
"Victims are also recruited for the marriage market, as well as to sports clubs and football clubs."
"According to estimates by the United Nations and the International Organisation for Migration, the IOM, every year four million people throughout the world fall victim to trafficking, 500 000 of whom end up in Europe."
"All the signs are there that the number of victims is rising and that the influx from Central and Eastern European countries has exceeded the existing stream from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia."
"In a report by the United Nations, it is stressed that trafficking in people is one of the fastest growing forms of organised crime."
"The huge profits and relative safety for the perpetrators who generate this type of crime will undoubtedly have something to do with this."
"The penalties for smuggling narcotics, for example, are far higher than those for trafficking in women."
"Victims are often unable to speak out on account of the illegal situation they are in."
"Since there are clear indications that these problems are developing within the framework of international networks, it is important that these problems are addressed and tackled at European level."
"In order to tackle trafficking in people adequately, we first of all need a clear definition of trafficking in people."
"Priority must also be given to the fight against organised networks which are not only involved in trafficking in people but which are also involved in all kinds of other criminal activity, such as the trade in narcotics, arms and such like. I therefore applaud the new Community initiatives concerning money laundering where the income from trafficking in women plays a major role."
"Various initiatives have already been taken at European level."
"Efforts to increase public awareness have got off to a good start in the form of activities on the part of Interpol and Europol, initiatives in every individual Member State, Habitat projects, etc. However, the harmonisation of the different national legislations in this field and the ensuing discrepancies in methods of investigation and prosecution have to be tackled at European level as a matter of priority."
"From a survey organised in connection with this report, it is quite clear that there are considerable discrepancies in this sphere between the Member States and between one candidate country and another."
"Some countries which have strict legislation on prostitution do not even have any legislation at all on trafficking in people."
"By introducing the STOP programme, Europe is striking while the iron is hot, and opportunities for collaboration have opened up."
"Last year, the Council adopted the DAPHNE programme."
"This is a new policy tool intended to prevent all kinds of violence - physical, sexual and psychological - against women and children."
"It is encouraging that, in the first half of this year, the Commission wishes to submit detailed proposals for harmonising criminal legislation in the Member States on trafficking in people with a view to their sexual exploitation and, specifically, proposals for granting temporary residence permits to victims who are prepared to cooperate in the investigations which are necessary if legal action is to be taken against the traffickers."
"Scanning the amendments, I have the impression that some people want to hijack this report, which is about victims of trafficking in people, to start a debate on prostitution."
"In the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, a clear decision was made to discuss trafficking in women, or forced prostitution, within the framework of this report."
"A debate on whether or not to ban or legalise prostitution may be pressing, but cannot be held at this point in the interest of the victims of trafficking in people."
"As I said, trafficking in people is not just about the problem of demand for prostitution."
"Victims of trafficking in women also find it extremely difficult to re-integrate into their place of origin and even within their own families."
"Once they have, as victims, worked in prostitution, they are labelled prostitutes for the rest of their lives or, as the saying goes, once a prostitute, always a prostitute."
"The initiatives which have been taken are the first step towards a solution but the number of victims continues to grow."
"A great deal therefore remains to be done."
"We have submitted proposals on prevention, reception of victims and legislation."
"A society faced with such a phenomenon has a moral duty towards the victims and must give a high priority to the fight against trafficking in people and to victim support."
". (FR) Mr President, this report is vitally important."
"We are profoundly affected by the tragedy of trafficking in women which is a modern form of slavery."
"Our priority must be to give aid and assistance to the victims."
"We must fight to eliminate all the links in the chain, namely recruitment, transport, managers, middlemen and clients."
"By holding this debate today in the European Parliament, we are helping the victims to regain their dignity and integrity."
"Women and children are being traded like goods and doomed to prostitution."
"Trafficking in women is an important type of trade for organised crime which regards human beings as goods to be bought and sold."
"Misfortune, misery and the false promises of pimps are luring these young women into our countries."
"They are attracted by promises of employment and some even come in the hope of getting married."
"They have no idea of the miserable conditions in which they will be exploited, beaten, tortured and threatened."
"Over half of the victims are under the age of 25 and around 10% are between 15 and 18."
"Even if these very young girls seem willing, because they are being threatened or are in love, we cannot, at any price, allow prostitution to continue freely when you see how these women are terrorised and traded."
"This is why, in our opinion, we cannot use the term 'forced prostitution' in this report."
"Trafficking in women involves terrible sexual exploitation."
"We must help these victims to speak out and denounce their living conditions."
"We must welcome and help them."
"The pimps are very violent and victims must pay off large debts to cover the cost of their journeys and the various identity documents which they must acquire."
"When they resist the pressure of traffickers and pimps, they are threatened either personally or through their families."
"The traffickers belong to a Mafia-like criminal organisation and control several links in the network that has power over the victim."
"There is no way out for victims and the very nature of the environment in which they work often reduces them to despair and drug addiction."
"Some even go as far as committing suicide."
"Fighting against trafficking in human beings is essential but it is better to prevent this."
"It is therefore vital to establish a system of information and preventive education for both young people in the countries concerned and also clients who are often what we would call 'family men' ."
"We should not forget that trafficking has economic roots."
"Inequalities and relationships of dependency between privileged and disadvantaged countries mean that it is still always the weakest in society, particularly the women, who pay the price."
"We demand a coherent European policy which is why this report is so important."
"Trafficking in women is a crime. Trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation are unworthy of humanity."
"Mr President, it has already been said."
"We are touching upon an important topic here, namely that of people' s dignity."
"As has been said, it is not just about trafficking in women, although that is the subject of the communication, but it extends to trafficking in people generally."
"Men, girls and boys, are also involved."
"It is a growing problem in the EU, too."
"Trafficking in women appears to be financially lucrative."
"Not only do women from Asian countries fall victim, but also more and more women from Central and Eastern European countries, including women from candidate countries."
"They are lured under false pretences - through job advertisements, for example - into becoming hairdressers or into working in bars or as dancers, or else they are enticed via the lonely hearts columns."
"Women are often easy prey, given the poor conditions they live under."
"Trafficking in women is increasingly linked with international criminal organisations."
"A great deal has been done, but still more needs to be done, especially when it comes to aligning different countries' legislation for the purposes of tracing and prosecution and when it comes to providing information to the police and courts."
"This is why I welcome the European Commission' s initiative, as well as the specific proposals in the report, for example, with regard to the further harmonisation of legislation which may facilitate the tracing of victims and prosecution of offenders and make these activities more efficient; with regard to cooperation and coordination, especially during investigations, at police stations and in the courts; and also specifically with regard to the reception and protection of victims."
"I hope it will be possible to adopt the amendment on non-governmental organisations, tabled by our group and amended in consultation with the Greens."
"Whenever new needs arise, emergency help is often provided by people or groups of people who feel compelled to do something about these on ideological grounds or out of religious conviction."
"These groups do not always get the recognition they deserve."
"The amendment states that NGOs can also include ideologically-based organisations."
"Finally, I would like to state that this is an important communication from the Commission."
"It is a sound communication and a sound report on which I would like to congratulate Mrs Sörensen."
"I hope that the Member States will adopt a dynamic approach in their future dealings with it."
"Mr President, the shameful truth is that our prosperous and free Europe is tolerating a lucrative trade - the trafficking in women - which involves torture, inhumane treatment and flagrant violations of fundamental rights."
"The victims have described savage beatings, rapes, abductions, death threats and, on occasions, murders."
"The real scandal is that we not only tolerate it in Europe, but we contribute to its expansion."
"Every time members of the public purchase the sexual services of a woman trapped in a trafficking ring, they are adding to the abhorrent wealth of these criminal organisations, which employ increasingly cruel methods."
"Unfortunately, the institutions' search for solutions is progressing very slowly, and the problem is growing."
"In any event, we should recognise that the European Commission' s proposals are, on the whole, reasonable and hopefully useful."
"Nevertheless, and given the cross-border nature of this crime, we need to harmonise its classification in all the Member States, including cross-border aspects and universal jurisdiction."
"The receiving countries should grant the victims a temporary residence permit for the duration of legal proceedings, regardless of whether or not they wish to testify."
"Furthermore, the extremely harsh conditions in which the victims live more than justify the Member States granting them permanent residence permits for humanitarian reasons."
"Furthermore, persecution on the basis of gender and, specifically, the trafficking in women, should be considered appropriate grounds for the granting of refugee status."
"If we really want to help the victims, we must guarantee their safety as well as that of their families and compensate them through the seizure of the networks' assets."
"These victims should also have free access to shelter, medical and psychological assistance, social services, help in finding work, etc."
"All of these considerations have been approved practically unanimously by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, but they will not be enough."
"Combating the trafficking in women and immigration policy must become a priority within the political agenda of the European Union and the Member States."
"Immigration policies which revolve around the consequences and which are not aimed at tackling the causes will do nothing more than exacerbate this terrible pattern of exploitation which is tantamount to slavery."
"Poverty, social inequality and armed conflict explain migratory flows."
"Until we find overall solutions to the question of development, the number of people searching for a better life will be unstoppable and migratory pressure uncontainable."
"So let us analyse, assess and implement genuine development and integration policies."
"At the end of the day, the fight against the trafficking in human beings, as well as being essential to the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice, is an unavoidable ethical duty."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Sörensen."
"Not only is she proficient, she is also extremely committed to the subject matter."
"The fact that she managed to put this important topic on the European agenda is a huge achievement."
"Trafficking in women has been overlooked for too long, and politicians underestimate its importance."
"A good illustration of this is that it is now three years since the Justice Ministers declared that it was important to appoint national rapporteurs to monitor trafficking in women."
"This actually happened in the Netherlands, not least thanks to the efforts of Secretary of State Verstand."
"Unfortunately, many Member States still do not have national rapporteurs and they really should remedy this as soon as possible."
"At the same time, legislation as well as cooperation are inadequate."
"This report offers many ideas and specific proposals and therefore has the backing of the Liberal Group."
"There are, however, two points which may seem commendable, but to which we are unfortunately unable to subscribe."
"The first concerns automatic refugee status for victims of trafficking in women."
"In our opinion, this is a bridge too far, because this would require the entire Geneva Convention to be overturned."
"We do find it important, however, that it should be possible to grant residence permits on humanitarian grounds. We will therefore continue to support this proposal."
"Our second objection concerns the reversal of the burden of proof."
"What is required here is tantamount to surrendering an important and fundamental part of legal protection, namely the fact that one is considered innocent until proven guilty."
"This principle is important in a constitutional state."
"The concept is taken from administrative law and mainly pertains to discrimination at the workplace."
"To incorporate this principle into criminal law would be a huge step."
"Liberals attach great importance to legal protection and we are not prepared to take that step now."
"Finally, the discussion on trafficking in women and people is important and a matter of urgency."
"This is why it would be wrong to weigh down this discussion with moral judgements on prostitution, as certain people here are attempting to do."
"If we do this, it will make the discussion infinitely more complex and will get in the way of effective measures against the trafficking in women."
"This should not happen."
"The problem is urgent and effective measures are required."
"Not just words, but deeds are what are needed now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope you will allow me to speak on behalf of the Greens as my colleague has had to accompany the Member who was taken ill."
"In my opinion, it is very fortunate that Mrs Sörensen should have been given the responsibility of preparing this report on trafficking in women."
"There are few rapporteurs who have such direct knowledge of this subject for Mrs Sörensen has been concerned for over 20 years with the issues of trafficking in women and prostitution."
"We should therefore place our full trust in her proposals. I myself totally support her report."
"However, I should like to comment briefly on the discussions held on this subject in committee and also in the Member States, given that the United Nations Conference on the situation of women throughout the world, to be held in New York in June, is now approaching."
"In these discussions several rather abolitionist associations have tried to lump together trafficking in women, prostitution and pimping."
"They have therefore encouraged a certain amount of generalisation and are, as a result, opposed to any form of debate on these issues, hiding behind moral considerations such as the inalienability of the human body and its treatment as a saleable commodity."
"To this end, they have attacked the latest report by the International Labour Office on trafficking in women and prostitution, and the work of Mrs Lin Lean Lim highlighting the need for a statute to protect prostitutes. They have also decried Europe as a pimp on the grounds that certain countries are trying to establish non-abolitionist legislation in this area."
"We surely cannot leave an issue such as this in the hands of associations of which some, and only some, having fought against abortion, are now refusing the distribution of condoms to prostitutes, which they see as encouraging prostitution."
"There is but a single step from commiseration to stigmatisation and from victimisation to contempt and exclusion from public debate."
"The only solution for prostitutes is to be integrated within a common law system, to look after themselves, to live decently, to defend themselves against the violence to which they are subjected by pimps, clients and institutions. The only solution is to recognise prostitutes as such and, as a first step, to give them a voice."
"Recognition of their professional activity, full social rights and police protection from any form of violence are what they are demanding."
"We must listen to them."
"Whether legislation is abolitionist as in France, prohibitionist as in Sweden or even sometimes regulatory, if it fails to recognise a whole population this can only reinforce discrimination against forced immigrants and also prostitutes, irrespective of whether they are immigrants or not."
"The ineffectiveness of the law reinforces the enslavement of male and female prostitutes by pimps, for some, and the impossibility for others of living with dignity or of getting out of prostitution. This leads to a breakdown in any fragile solidarity and further damage to their self-image."
"Mrs Roure is right in her analysis of this problem but we accept that different solutions must be examined and that various proposals must be made and considered."
"The Commission absolutely must examine all forms of common legislation on prostitution which would give real status to prostitutes in order to protect these women and men from pimping, violence and marginalisation."
"Mr President, to begin with, I want to thank Mrs Sörensen for a very good, interesting and tremendously readable report."
"We are almost one hundred per cent in agreement in the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"We would emphasise not only the cooperation from the police which has fed into this report, but also the importance of contributions at all levels of society."
"There are nonetheless two things we do not entirely agree with."
"The first concerns the role of the sex industry in this issue."
"We are, all of us, right across the political spectrum, completely agreed that it is poverty that is the major cause of prostitution and trafficking in women."
"I nonetheless believe that the sex industry, which is now moreover beginning to register some of its activities on the stock exchange, must be called into question and, in future, also held to account."
"The other disputed issue is - as always where this subject is concerned - the view to be taken of prostitution."
"Almost throughout the report, the term enforced prostitution is used."
"However, the use of this term implies that there is an opposite, that is to say voluntary prostitution."
"That is very strange, especially when we are talking about slavery and trafficking in women."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has tabled a few amendments, some of them on this subject and in connection with which we naturally hope that we shall receive support."
"I would again thank Mrs Sörensen and all our colleagues."
"Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be the last time we debate this issue, even though it is so far only the second time we have done so."
"Mr President, trafficking in women is not just a women' s issue. It also falls within the wider global context of international crime and trafficking in human beings."
"Raising such an issue today might seem anachronistic but slavery will indeed be a part of the 21st century."
"It is a potent force which takes advantage of the misery of the displaced who travel the world against their will, who are sold, bought and then brought to Europe."
"Nothing is preventing these global pimps from pressurising families to sell their children and luring girls to Europe to make them work and become prostitutes."
"During a conference organised jointly by the United States of America and the Philippines in March, the very lucrative aspect of this new market was also raised."
"Trafficking in human beings is, after drugs and weapons, the third largest source of income for organised crime."
"Yet trafficking in human beings is, above all, a violation of human dignity and human rights."
"Our societies are demanding the right to happiness, pleasure and freedom, and the removal of taboos."
"It seems not to matter if people, women and children in particular, are paying the price by being dragged down into the underworld."
"Prostitution is a form of slavery which we like to make out to be exotic and romantic in order to hide its tragedy and sordidness."
"Yet it is actually a denial of freedom."
"These crimes are committed solely for the sake of pleasure and are treated with widespread indifference by a society which accepts prostitution as the oldest profession in the world. This is also true of pornography which is found in the daily papers, on television and on the Internet, where everything can be bought, even girls."
"Prostitution, trafficking in human beings, sex tourism and paedophilia are all issues highlighted by the media which are gradually becoming less taboo."
"So much the better, for the resignation shown towards what society has deemed to be irreversible is intolerable."
"We must now help these people whose bodies are being exploited for commercial purposes, both in our countries and in their countries of origin, by increasing aid for development, education and cooperation between countries."
"The European Union must wake up to this situation and, rather than giving lessons to the women of the world, five years after the Beijing Conference, it would do better to clean up its own backyard."
"Trafficking in human beings is incredibly widespread in our countries because the demand exists and because the European Union is adept at showing itself to be a greedy customer, disdainful of the distress caused to these adults and children who have been denied any choice."
"To conclude, I will refer to the slogan of the seminar organised in Paris on 15 May under the patronage of the European Parliament which says that the humiliation of human beings through prostitution represents an intolerable attack on human rights."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Members of the Bonino List, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report on the tragic issue of trafficking in women."
"We are sure that Parliament will adopt this extremely well-balanced report by a very large majority, for no one could tolerate the current violence perpetrated against women who are abducted or forced by deception and threats to enter the European Union, where they are compelled to live a life of forced prostitution or do some other sort of job under coercion."
"We are all familiar with the horrific stories of prostitutes, often minors, who are abducted from their native countries, forced to enter the Union - we are told - illegally, raped and threatened with retaliation against their relatives or even killed if they have the courage to denounce their pimps."
"The report recommends possible solutions which have already been successfully implemented, such as issuing victims with residence permits and providing protection and free healthcare."
"These measures, which have already been successfully implemented in some States, must be extended to cover the whole of the European Union."
"I would, however, like to draw your attention to a matter of paramount importance: is it not the direct and indirect prohibition of prostitution and the restrictive laws on immigration which are responsible for trafficking in women and forced prostitution?"
"Is it not the case that the victims of prostitution-related crimes are compelled to enter that profession because of their illegal immigrant status and their vulnerability, caught between the violence of their pimps and the forces of the law?"
"Is it not the very fact of prohibition which renders the phenomenon it is intended to control uncontrollable, tragic and inhuman?"
"And why should those people who, of their own free will, want to be prostitutes have to suffer from what is essentially a ban on related activities and the subterfuge which, in practice, criminalise the practice of voluntary prostitution, even though prostitution is formally legal in many Member States?"
"Moreover, would the legalisation of voluntary prostitution not also allow foreign prostitutes to improve their situation in that they would no longer be obliged to work illegally in violent conditions as they are now?"
"For this reason, we have tabled two amendments: the first amendment calls for the preparation of a cost/benefit analysis of the various laws and policies currently in place and those which may be adopted in the future; the second amendment proposes measures to protect adults from criminal exploitation and violence, adults who, in all freedom from direct or indirect coercion, choose to work as prostitutes, accepting to run their business in accordance with legal procedures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, simply raising a problem is an admission of its gravity."
"Some 500 000 victims of the traffic in human beings arrive each year in Western Europe."
"It is imperative to tackle trafficking in women because, having shown its determination to fight money laundering, drug trafficking and organised crime, the European Union has forgotten that trafficking in human beings is one of the major aspects of organised crime."
"I must congratulate Mrs Sörensen on her report which has come on the eve of the enlargement of the Union to the CCEEs, which are often singled out as the countries of origin or transit in prostitution and modern-day slavery."
"As for the method, I must say that the fight against trafficking in human beings does not necessarily need full communitarisation but rather close cooperation between Member States under the aegis of Europol and Interpol. These inter-state structures have proven their effectiveness on the ground."
"Our aim is to ensure that trafficking in human beings is regarded as a criminal offence to be severely punished in all Member States. In doing so, examples must also be made of those responsible for instigating such networks."
"Given the current state of legislation, we are faced with a wide diversity of penal traditions in our Member States."
"Establishing specific offences at Community level would therefore lead to an impasse."
"Instead, we must take inspiration from the method in the Schmid report on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment."
"The Council of Ministers could, on a proposal from the Commission, draw up a list of criminal behaviour to be combated, which the Member States would be responsible for converting into criminal offences in accordance with their legal traditions."
"To conclude, I am sure that this would render the action we are taking to combat this scourge more effective and that we would avoid the pitfalls of a harmonisation which would delay the measures which must now be adopted."
"The debate on this report looks set to run into the afternoon, but more specific information on the continuation of the debate and the organisation of business for today' s sitting will be provided later on."
"We shall now proceed to the votes."
"Mr President, there was to have been a debate on the question of football violence."
"The events last night in Copenhagen underline the importance of the European Parliament having this debate, as it decided to do earlier in the week."
"Because of the natural difficulties about the location of the matches under Euro 2000, the PPE-ED Group as a whole has decided not to support this resolution and to withdraw it."
"On the other hand, the British delegation, which is now 36 members, has retabled the resolution in its original form."
"Mr President, I ask you to rule it admissible for this debate to now take place, as was the wish of the House earlier in the week."
"The debate will take place as proposed."
"The exact time will be announced later."
"Vote"
"Mr President, I am very surprised at the order of voting here."
"I would ask you to reverse it so that the compromise resolution by four groups, including the two biggest groups, comes first."
"Mr Purvis, the way we work is that the first resolution tabled is the first taken."
"When a compromise is created, if it contains the first resolution, that compromise is taken first, no matter how many groups are involved in the compromise."
"Mr President, the resolution by the Green Group was tabled first."
"It is perfectly correct that we should vote on that text first as we reached a compromise with a number of other groups."
"Indeed, Members throughout this House have supported it."
"I hope they will do so during the vote - even some Members of political groups who have not supported that compromise - because the situation at Sellafield is serious."
"Let us proceed with the vote and not reopen the debate."
"(Parliament rejected the joint motion for a resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0414/2000) by Ms Ahern and others, on safety problems at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on falsification of data concerning MOX fuels at Sellafield"
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"
"Report (A5-0109/2000) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the draft Commission directive amending Directive 80/723/EEC on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings (SEC(1999) 404 - C5-0102/2000 - 2000/2065(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on the external debt of poor countries"
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"

"Report (A5-0094/2000) by Mr Paasilinna, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Fifth Report on the Implementation of the Telecommunications Regulatory Package (COM(1999) 537 - C5-0112/2000 - 2000/2072(COS))"
"Mr President, I had requested the floor in relation to the vote on Zimbabwe, when we voted mechanically on 12 amendments presented by the so-called Technical Group of Independent Members, and having noted that in no case have they voted in favour of their amendments, they have systematically forced us to vote."
"I say this in relation to the Provan report and the reform of the voting system in Parliament."
"I believe this is an unacceptable way to proceed."
"Mr President, I have an interest in a sector affected by the Commission communication which is the subject of this report."
"As a result, I will not take part in any vote on this report."
"I must do likewise with regard to the following report by Mr Alyssandrakis on radio spectrum policy, unless you can immediately formally acknowledge my declaration."
"Mr President, Mrs Flesch quite rightly declares an interest in matters in which she has an interest."
"I suggest that such a declaration is not necessary when voting."
"When Members are speaking in debate, either in committee or in plenary, they should declare an interest, but that should not prevent them from voting on a subject."
"I do not want to have a debate on this."
"I do not want to dig the rules up."
"My own memory of the Rules is that you should do it before votes as well."
"I also have a financial interest in telecom and space so I will not participate in the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0122/2000) by Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on: ""Next Steps in Radio Spectrum Policy - Results of the Public Consultation on the Green Paper"" (COM(1999) 538 - C5-0113/2000 - 2000/2073(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0119/2000) by Mr Alyssandrakis, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission working document: ""Towards a coherent European approach for space"" (SEC(1999) 789 C5-0336/1999 - 1999/2213(COS))"
"After the adoption of two amendments:Ford, Glyn (PSE)."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"These two amendments are very similar to those which were rejected in committee."
"Could we be clear that the rapporteur is giving the committee's view and not his own?"
"I think that is a matter for you to discuss in your committee."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0131/2000) by Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the communication of the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions ""Towards a European research area"" (COM(2000) 6 - C5-0115/2000 - 2000/2075(COS))"
"Mr President, I wanted to make the following suggestion."
"A number of amendments have been tabled which were, in fact, already in the text when the vote was taken in committee."
"With your help, I would like to try to tidy up the report a little and remove a number of redundant items."
"In addition, I have an oral amendment to paragraphs L, M, N and O which I have distributed to the different coordinators who assented to it."
"This is a tidying-up exercise."
"Are there any objections to that oral amendment?"
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"Mr President, in these circumstances, an own-initiative report and all this confusion, I propose that it be returned to the competent committee and that they do the work properly."
"Mr Barón Crespo, is this a formal request on behalf of the Socialist Group?"
"Mr President, this is not a formal request, it is an unavoidable comment about the way this House deals with important matters."
"We can only vote here on things that have really been worked through in committee."
"It really is unacceptable to work like this in this Chamber!"
"Mr President, with great respect to the rapporteur, she is making a point which was not made at all in the debate last night."
"This is a report which had to be produced in great haste."
"Two committees made substantial input to it."
"It may be that, in the end, there will be some redundancy, but there are different points being made."
"Last night the Commissioner gave no indication that he found anything ambiguous or difficult."
"It is quite out of order that we should do anything other than vote on each of the points on the voting list."
"I would like to thank everyone for their comments but I agree most with the comment made by Mr Hänsch."
"Maybe it is useful occasionally to look at how we set about things here in Parliament."
"This seems a very enjoyable exercise."
"I do not want to start another debate."
"The Bureau is looking at the working methods of Parliament."
"You will all receive a copy of Mr Provan' s excellent discussion document in the near future."
"Mr President, the paragraph 13 which emerged from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, states that the Legal Affairs Committee agreed to request biennial reporting, that is to say, reporting every two years."
"Whereas, perhaps owing to my curious accent, it was transcribed as ""biannual"" , which would require two reports a year and would be over-egging the pudding!"
"I therefore request that this be orally amended to ""biennial"" ."
"(Parliament accepted the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0125/2000) by Ms Smet and Ms Gröner, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the follow-up to the Beijing Action Platform (2000/2020(INI))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"President."
"That concludes the vote."
"Before the House adjourns you might like to hear the proposal for the organisation of business for the rest of the day."
"We are proposing at 3 p.m. to have a debate on the Buitenweg report, followed by the debate on items of topical and urgent debate."
"At 6 p.m. we will vote firstly on Buitenweg and then on the urgency resolutions and then after that, on all the other votes on which the debates have closed."
"That will be the agenda."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Twice this week we have been in a situation where groups have made requests for a roll-call vote on the final vote of a report and, just before the final vote, the Chamber is told that the roll call has been withdrawn."
"What is the situation, because if, for example, a request for a roll call has been made, other groups do not actually make a request so the opportunity to hold a roll-call vote on the final report is denied us?"
"Could you explain what the situation is?"
"I accept that it is unsatisfactory that groups can withdraw their requests at any stage."
"All I can suggest is a belt-and-braces approach."
"If you want to ensure that there is a roll call, make a request on behalf of your own group as well."
"I accept that it is not a very satisfactory situation."
"Mr President, I think there should be an opportunity for someone else to take over the request for a roll-call vote."
"There must be a chance to do this if another group withdraws its request."
"That was the point here!"
"This is a matter for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"Under the present rules there is nothing to stop Members withdrawing their requests for roll-call votes."
"Mr President, I did not understand what was to happen with Mrs Sörensen' s report."
"Will the debate continue following the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance?"
"Otherwise, when is it intended that the debate should take place?"
"According to the information I received earlier, we were to continue the debate on Mrs Sörensen' s report today, following the vote on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"You did not say that this was to be the case, however, and I should therefore like to have it confirmed."
"That is correct."
"As normal after the votes, we will continue with the debates and the first two are Sörensen and Karamanou."
"So we will carry on with the debates."
"Mr President, I would also like to say a few words on the order of business for this afternoon."
"You have indicated that we will start with the Buitenweg report at 3.00 p.m. and that we will vote at 6.00 p.m."
"On our desks, we have found an anonymous document which states that we will be voting on the Buitenweg report and also dealing with any remaining votes at 6.00 p.m."
"Secondly, the document lists the urgency, debate on which has been concluded, and thirdly, contains urgencies which have not been debated due to a lack of time."
"I would like you to confirm whether the third point is being considered and I would like to register a protest against it, because that would mean that we would have to vote on urgencies that have not been debated."
"This seems unacceptable to me."
"That is correct and that is what the House has agreed to, so that is what we will be doing."
"Mr President, I rise on a similar point, because I am not clear what the House has agreed to."
"We have agreed to vote at 6 p.m."
"What we could do is reduce the amount of speaking time for urgencies so there will be an opportunity for a debate on each of them."
"It is certainly not clear to the House that we have agreed to vote on urgencies that have failed to be discussed."
"Mr Ford, that is not a matter for the President."
"What we have decided is to allocate the first hour of what normally would have been the urgency debate to the Buitenweg report."
"The house did that earlier."
"That was a decision for the House."
"The House is sovereign in these matters."
"It is then up to the groups to decide how they allocate speaking time for the urgency debates."
"If we have enough time we will do all the debates; if we do not, we will not."
"It will depend on how the groups allocate speaking time between the different subjects and that is a matter for the groups, not for the President."
"Mr President, we agreed that we would take the debate on Buitenweg, not that we would spend one hour on it."
"For example, I have been told that I will be speaking just after an hour into the debate, so I guess the Buitenweg debate will take probably an hour and a half at least."
"It was not agreed we would reduce the time of that debate, let us be clear on that."
"You are right."
"I said an hour."
"It was a slip of the tongue."
"I believe it is scheduled for an hour and a half."
"Again, it will depend on Members' discipline, something that this House is renowned for."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I refer to the comments made in a statement this morning by Mrs Fontaine regarding certain logistical problems in the building."
"In the interests of transparency and information to Members, we need to know the extent of the problem of legionella."
"Could you provide us with information on that?"
"What procedures have been put in place?"
"Has the air-conditioning system now been switched off?"
"Can we therefore assume that an operation has been undertaken to disinfect the system?"
"Could you confirm this and, indeed, could Parliament' s presidency confirm that there is no problem with asbestosis which, of course, would be in breach of our own EU directive passed over a decade ago."
"I personally am not in a position to answer any of your questions."
"I have no information on this subject."
"You will have to refer the matter to the President and to the Quaestors."
"I will certainly draw attention to your remarks."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Ferber report (A5-0121/2000)"
"Mr President, I was unable to assent to the Ferber report."
"From Parliament' s viewpoint, there is always a reason to ask for more money for our own operations."
"But the European Union will not become more democratic if the European Parliament receives more funding."
"Public opinion within Europe requires us to be frugal."
"The money that is available should be spent on the needs of our 375 million people and on the protection of our environment, not on the European Parliament as an institution."
"I am of the opinion that we could save ourselves a great deal of cost and unnecessary effort if we were to replace the system of reports and rapporteurs by getting the groups to react directly to the planned proposals, as is the case in most national parliaments."
"Finally, I am also against donating tax money to European syndicates of political parties and against filling vacancies for interpreters in a way which offers newcomers a poor legal position."
"Mr President, I was happy to vote for the Ferber report on the budget for the financial year 2001, but I am not very happy with the minimal amount of space, money and European Union funds it allocates to supporting activities benefiting pensioners and the elderly."
"I do not mean that we have to allocate to pensioners, the elderly and their problems the same proportion of our budget as they occupy of society, i.e. approximately 32% at the last count."
"I am not saying that 32% of our budget should be allocated to activities related to the elderly, but I would, nevertheless, be very happy with at least 3%, or even 0.3%."
"- (NL) I am 100% behind the proposal to in fact allocate 35 vacant posts, funded from the enlargement reserve, to the language sector, provided, however, that all languages of the candidate countries are represented."
"This is why I have voted in favour of Amendment No 2."
"It is essential that the European Parliament be well prepared for the forthcoming enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe."
"This should coincide with the timely training of professional and highly skilled translators and interpreters."
"As previous enlargements have shown, it is not viable to wait for this to happen."
"Multilingualism is a prerequisite for the smooth running of the European Parliament for three reasons."
"Firstly, on account of the principle of equality, according to which all Members must be able to carry out their work under the same conditions."
"Secondly, due to the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament is the democratic representation of the people."
"Thirdly, because of the requirement of usefulness."
"Multilingualism boosts the efficiency of parliamentary work."
"In order to give concrete form to this requirement of multilingualism, we need a debate as a matter of urgency."
"In this connection, I would refer to the final report of the working party on ""multilingualism"" , compiled under the guidance of Mr Cot, in which various specific options have been suggested."
"Whichever is adopted, it is clear that linguistic preparation for enlargement should not be postponed any longer."
"- (NL) Democracy inevitably costs a great deal of money."
"We are voting on a Parliament budget to the tune of nearly EUR 1 billion!"
"A huge sum, although it remains within the agreed 20% of the estimate for all European institutions put together."
"We owe it to the citizens of Europe - the taxpayers, who have to produce this kind of capital - to keep the costs in check."
"Reading in paragraph 18 about the buildings which Parliament needs, we can only conclude that a considerable amount of Community money is being squandered."
"Indeed, the European Parliament has no need at all for the building in which we are meeting this week!"
"We have everything we need in Brussels in terms of facilities."
"Let it be clear that we have no need to buy this glass palace, whatever - I am sure - necessary conditions are being met."
"Recently, more than 400 Members once again stated that we want to decide for ourselves where we meet."
"We are hardly blaming the rapporteur for overlooking this in his report, which certainly deserves appreciation, for example, when he calls on the Council and European Parliament to agree on the statute of the Members."
"This Parliament should be deeply ashamed of the fact that, one year after the elections, this is still not even in sight."
"The budget line suggested by the Court of Auditors for European parties is really not necessary."
"All-embracing budget lines of this kind blur our cultural and political diversity and increase the distance between ourselves and the citizen."
"As far as the many thefts in the buildings are concerned, it is unacceptable that, despite an extensive security service, these can take place more or less on a daily basis."
"With our vote against this budget, we want to send out a signal that a radical change is required in the priorities we set."
"- (NL) I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Ferber, on his report, although I did not agree with everything and voted - against his recommendation - for Amendment No 2 and against Amendment No 8 of his draft resolution."
"I have done so with great conviction because I am of the view that we as the European Parliament do not send out a political signal or pre-empt a political decision by adopting the Secretary-General' s proposal (and filling 35 vacancies in the language sector) but accomplish this by doing the exact opposite."
"As long as the House rules on language use are not amended, the candidate countries and ourselves can assume that the language arrangement will stay as it is, that is to say: first of all, that each MEP can use his own language at official meetings."
"Secondly, that each MEP has documents in his language at his disposal."
"Thirdly, that we in this way are not only treating the Members equally but above all, the citizens we represent."
"- (DE) I voted for Mr Ferber' s report on our budget for 2001, but I cannot let this opportunity pass without protesting in the strongest terms against what can only be described as the blackmail practised against certain categories of officials, particular more junior ones, so that they find themselves 'voluntarily compelled' to transfer from Luxembourg to Brussels, on the pretext that they are in Brussels or Strasbourg 'en mission' , i.e. on business, for more than 50 working days per year."
"The European Parliament now has three places of work: Brussels, Luxembourg and Strasbourg."
"This was agreed by the Heads of State and Government at their summit in Edinburgh years ago."
"We have to live with this, and with its financial consequences, which are not so great, and which are certainly justified by avoiding unhealthy centralisation in Brussels, as is unfortunately practised by a good third of the present Members of the European Parliament."
"We are now suffering from an example of this centralisation at the hands of certain Green Members, who prevented a number of important votes on the Friday of the April Strasbourg part-session, because the quorum of one third of the Members present was not established."
"I have been a Member of this Parliament since 1965, with a break between 1974 and 1989, so I have 20 years' of attendance behind me, during which time I was present at every Friday sitting in Strasbourg."
"The flimsy arguments put forward by those who want to reduce the European Parliament' s five-day week in Strasbourg to four days, and who would also prefer not to turn up here on Mondays, are part of their salami tactics, which are obviously aimed at sabotaging Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg for 12 sittings each year, not to mention their objective of transferring the offices of the Secretariat from Luxembourg to Brussels."
"The Bureau now intends to present a working paper by a British Vice-President which proposes moving all the services and Directorates-General from Luxembourg to Brussels."
"The idea is to keep at most the specialist services such as the printing and translating services in Luxembourg."
"This cannot and will not happen."
"It would be a clear infringement of the letter and the spirit of the decisions made by the Heads of State and Government about Parliament' s places of work, and this needs to be said here in the clearest possible terms."
"I have a word of warning for those people who are using these salami tactics against Strasbourg and Brussels."
"We will thwart your highly undemocratic machinations against democratically reached decisions about Parliament' s places of work and about the calendar of meetings - because we have right on our side."
"Katiforis report (A5-0134/2000)"
"I voted for the Katiforis report on the broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States because of the important points contained therein, but I did so unwillingly."
"This was because this report repeatedly states that we must react to the fact that the population is ageing and control it - the number of elderly people is constantly increasing, making it difficult to maintain pension systems - and that we need to be vigilant and call upon the Member States to spend increasingly less money on pension payments for the elderly."
"In my opinion, it is absolutely unacceptable that the elderly continue to be blamed for national budgetary difficulties."
"Mr President, as the rapporteur rightly mentions in the second point in his report, budget consolidation must be given the highest priority at present."
"We can only increase the confidence of the public and, above all, of the financial markets in the euro by means of consistent budgetary discipline."
"I say all this bearing in mind that the euro yesterday sank near to its historic low of 3 May."
"The rapporteur was unable to include the stability programme which has now been presented by the Austrian Government in his report."
"I would therefore like to point out that the new government is determined to overcome the problems that the previous government left behind."
"The old government led by the Social Democrats certainly did not bequeath it an easy task."
"However, all the commitments in the Stability Pact should now be fully met for the year 2000."
". (EL) Despite the objective of increasing productivity, investment and employment levels in the Union, the Commission' s broad guidelines of the economic policies of the Member States and the Community are a set of negative guidelines: continuing budgetary restrictions which go beyond the requirements of the Stability Pact, wage restrictions, tax reforms for the benefit of the better off, further disintegration of the labour market and the crucial importance of competition policy, which brings pressure to bear on the principles of social justice."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy, despite the sensitivity of its rapporteur, Mr Katiforis, has maintained the spirit of the Commission' s recommendation, which is why I shall vote against the motion for a resolution."
"The Union should promote a policy which combines quantitative development with a reduction in working times, increased productivity, tax reforms to support society and development and the modernisation, not the eradication, of the public sector."
"The Katiforis report is a crude apology for the broad economic policy guidelines of the Member States."
"Of its 29 paragraphs, eight start by showing approval and four by being self-congratulatory."
"For the working population and just about everyone else in the countries of the European Union, there is really nothing for which to congratulate oneself. What good is the economic growth vaunted by the report when it is recommended that 'reasonable attitudes in wage negotiations' are adopted, by employees of course, or when it is presumptuously claimed that 'a drastic revision of pension systems' is needed with the aim of 'safeguarding their financial soundness' ?"
"This is simply a way of acknowledging that, in this 'growth' which the Katiforis report asks Parliament to congratulate, there is no room for employees or pensioners."
"Once again, the Council and Commission are acting on behalf of employers and are asking Parliament to give its backing to this."
"As far as we are concerned, we were not elected to congratulate governments which help employers and major financial groups to get rich by exacerbating inequalities, leaving 18 million men and women unemployed, making flexibility and precariousness widespread and drastically reducing the wage bill in order to ensure continued growth in capital income, including in its most parasitic and speculative forms."
"If, as the report states, it is true that growth is returning, it is simply disgraceful that only a small minority in Europe will benefit from this."
"As a result we have voted against the report."
"I approved Mr Katiforis' s approach and arguments in committee."
"I was due to say this yesterday during the debate in plenary but a technical problem prevented me from doing so for which I apologise."
"Like Mr Katiforis, I am delighted to see renewed growth in Europe."
"However, also like the rapporteur, I know that this will not be enough to enable a return to a situation of full employment without the Member States adopting a proactive policy and, I would add, without a reduction in working hours."
"Finally, I too would say that employment cannot be generated by unbridled liberalisation, accelerated privatisation and a reduction of social and labour protection."
"I am not satisfied with everything on which we voted at midday but I have supported the rapporteur in the final vote."
"- (PT) In its broad economic policy guidelines for 2000, the European Commission makes it clear that it advocates neo-liberal policies, emphasising as it does the Stability Pact and monetarist policies, faster liberalisation of the telecommunications, energy, postal services, transport and financial services sectors, together with an increase in flexible working arrangements and in the modernisation of social protection systems."
"This means that despite referring to the need for active employment policies to combat unemployment and to achieve full employment in the medium term, the Commission continues to prescribe the same solutions, which have not brought any net improvement in employment, since the current unemployment rate is even higher than it was at the start of the decade, as the Commission recognises."
"In this European Parliament report, the rapporteur makes some criticisms of the acceleration of the convergence and stability criteria objectives, insists on the need to increase investment and accepts the adoption of global fiscal measures in order to combat financial speculation. This is a positive step."
"Nevertheless, he accepts faster liberalisation of the transport and energy sectors, an increase in flexible working and the process of budget consolidation already under way, thus highlighting his own contradictions."
"We have presented various amendments with a view to improving the content of the report. In particular, these are designed to strengthen the position of small and micro-enterprises and their associations, to advocate jobs associated with proper rights and reduced working hours, and to call into question the Stability Pact and the consequences of implementing it."
"Unfortunately, with the exception of support for SMEs, we were unable to have any of these amendments adopted, and have therefore voted against the report."
"I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on the quality of his work."
"The broad guidelines of European economic policy developed in this report seem to be heading in the right direction."
"Full employment and the transition to a knowledge-based economy form our common aim for the first decade of the 21st century."
"Whether or not the pessimists like this, all the economic lights are on green."
"We must therefore be bold in order to continue the growth now being witnessed at European level."
"The prospects for the years 2000 and 2001 are encouraging, with growth forecasts of over 3%. This will reinforce social links, increase solidarity and equal opportunities and, in particular, eliminate the inevitability of the mass unemployment which we have been enduring for too long."
"This last point clearly poses the main problem."
"Although unemployment has already gradually reduced, it is still at an unacceptable level throughout the Community, given the forecasts for 2001 of 8% unemployment among the working population. This is particularly true at the outer edges of the Community, in other words in the most remote regions."
"As I have said many times before, the fruits of growth must be shared equally by all European citizens, both mainlanders and islanders."
"This is the price of constructing a 21st century Europe with a human face in whose collective development everyone is involved. In this way we will all be able to make progress in our own individual areas, but still be heading in the same general direction."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Katiforis because I believe in this Europe."
"The Katiforis report is an incredible demonstration of the lack of awareness among European capitalists."
"It is based on a total misunderstanding of the reasons for the current recovery which is in no way the result of neo-liberal policies favouring wage austerity and a strong currency."
"On the contrary, current job creations are due to an economic context characterised by an increase in consumption among wage-earners and a weak euro favouring exports."
"Despite this convenient denial, the report proposes to plunge further into social regression."
"It proposes increased flexibility in the markets, starting with the labour market."
"It calls for 'wage stability' and exhorts the unions to adopt 'reasonable attitudes' in wage negotiations."
"So as not to appear to be the direct spokesperson for employers, the report tries to include some social clauses."
"Yet the contradictions are striking. How, for example, can it propose the reform or 'modernisation' of social protection, which in practice means replacing solidarity with financial products, and yet invoke a 'spirit of social cohesion' ?"
"How can wages be restricted 'in a spirit of fairness' when profits reveal unashamed exuberance?"
"The only other argument in the report invokes the use of new technologies to bring about modernisation."
"But why should these automatically be allowed to threaten the European social model?"
"This crude materialism, sometimes attributed to Marxists, has now been adopted by cynical capitalists whose only aim is to extend the rule of trade regardless of social needs."
"We have therefore voted against a text which is both foolish and repugnant."
"Mr Katiforis' s explanatory statement is clearly better than the main body of his report which contains no hint of the criticisms that were set out on the Commission' s recommendation."
"I and the National Front Members have voted against this report as we feel that it recommends the same old ineffectual and even harmful recipes. There is still too much emphasis on the markets, which regulate nothing, on ultraliberalism, particularly in the public services which the Commission would like to see dismantled, on sacrificing social protection for public investment to ensure budgetary stability, and on price stability, whereas inflation was curbed ages ago."
"For workers there is wage moderation, a reduction in unemployment benefits and a relaxation of employment protection legislation."
"Two points have particularly shaken us."
"The first is that the Commission recommends that my country, France, which is struggling under the weight of tax and social security contributions, should not take advantage of this growth to reduce taxes. The reason given for this is to avoid stimulating with the budget a level of economic activity which is already vigorous."
"Can you believe it?"
"Since when has growth been rejected in the name of outdated economic dogmas?"
"The second point is the almost total absence of any reference to the euro. This famous single currency which, it was said, would bring us a prosperous future and be snapped up by the whole world eager for competition with the US dollar, has been cold-shouldered, not only by investors who are investing in dollars in the USA, but also by the central banks."
"No one has any confidence in the euro, which is no longer a floating currency. Rather, it is a sinking currency, and nor do they have confidence in the European monetary authorities."
"Wim Duisenberg is not Allan Greenspan, the ECB is not the Federal Reserve and the euro is not the dollar."
"Europe has neither the employment rate nor the growth rate of the USA and it will take more than futile gestures to change this reality."
"Pomés Ruiz report (A5-0108/2000)"
"- (PT) The Pomés Ruiz report rigorously defends the principles of the Solidarity Pact, particularly as regards fiscal consolidation as a means of ensuring the sole objective of price stability."
"The analysis of the nominal convergence criteria is silent with regard to its consequences in terms of the risk of economic deflation, the adverse effect on public investment, economic growth and policies to combat unemployment."
"However, the rapporteur goes even further in supporting the Commission' s recommendations."
"He believes that it is necessary to anticipate in good time the objectives put forward in the stability and convergence programmes, so as to take advantage of the current 'much-improved economic environment' ."
"He therefore proposes swifter acceleration of fiscal consolidation, of structural reforms and of privatisation, and the ""modernisation"" of social protection, recommendations which have, in fact, already been made by the European Commission, particularly with regard to Portugal, in relation to the liberalisation of transport and energy and labour market flexibility, which is unacceptable."
"We have accordingly voted against the report."
"Goebbels report (A5-0135/2000)"
"Mr President, I have already declared, during the debate on the decision to allow Greece to enter the European single currency, that I am totally in favour of Greece' s immediate entry, for it has met all the criteria required by the Treaties of the European Union."
"I would stress that I particularly welcome the fact - and that is why I voted for this decision - that no more budgetary restrictions are to be imposed on Greece, for, sadly, the brunt of this could not fail to fall upon pensioners and the elderly, in this case Greek pensioners and elderly people, who would be the victims of the exacerbation of the situation as regards the country' s budget, for Greece is willing to further reduce the negative elements of the Maastricht criteria and we have recommended that it do so, even though it does already fulfil these criteria, as has been stated."
"- (EL) The legislative proposal of the European Parliament merely accepts the proposal by the Commission of the European Union, which confines itself to finding that ""Greece fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency. The derogation of Greece is abrogated with effect from 1 January 2000"" ."
"On the surface, Greece does indeed meet the budgetary and monetary indicators required for EMU."
"To this extent, and taking account of the position of my party, Synaspismos (the Coalition of the Left and Progress), in favour of Greece' s accession to Economic and Monetary Union, I have voted in favour."
"Personally, however, I have strong objections to and reservations about the policies of EMU, which tie the Member States into rigid budgetary austerity, rising unemployment, worsening social conflict and unbridled competition, without being able to offer a strong European currency which is able to stand up to the dollar worldwide."
"I am also totally opposed to the way in which the Greek government has achieved our accession to EMU, pursuing nominal rather than de facto convergence, making Greece one of the countries of the Union with the highest rates of unemployment and continually selling off the state' s assets in order to cover treasury deficits."
"Unfortunately, these policies will not end when we accede to EMU; on the contrary, they will be institutionalised, consolidated and set in stone."
"The Left and Progressive Forces of the Member States of EMU must extend their collaboration so that they can radically reform the way in which EMU is structured and so that priority can be given to social criteria and promoting the fight against unemployment, real convergence policies and viable and fair development policies."
"- (EL) The European Parliament is being called upon today to give its opinion on the adoption by Greece of the single currency, now that the Commission and the European Central Bank have given the go-ahead."
"We would start by pointing out that, as far as we are concerned, the matter is not technical, it is highly political."
"It is precisely on the basis of the ideological and political aspects of the entire process of EMU and the single currency that we shall be voting against the admission of the drachma to the euro zone."
"From a technical point of view, Greece has undisputedly managed to fulfil the criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty for entering the third stage of EMU."
"The problem, however, is how we got here and what happens next."
"The nominal convergence criteria have been achieved at the cost of intolerable sacrifice on the part of the Greek people and as the result of a harsh austerity policy, the main features of which were, and still are, reduced social spending, a highly restricted budgetary policy, wage freezes, limited protection for workers, deregulated markets and greater privatisation."
"Unfortunately, this policy, which has reduced large groups of the population to despair and has resulted in a dramatic rise in unemployment, a mass exodus from farming and the closure of factories throughout the country, will not be repealed when we enter the single currency; on the contrary, it will be stepped up."
"Both the obligations imposed by the Stability Pact and the strict recommendations accompanying the reports by the Commission and the European Central Bank prove it."
"Both demand that we continue the austerity policy, dismantle labour relations even more quickly, rush in measures to repeal the social security system and continue and accelerate the process of privatisation."
"It is obvious that the workers have nothing to gain from Greece' s accession to the single currency amidst disorientating celebrations; on the contrary, they are even more certain to see a continuation, on stricter terms and with increased ""supervision from on high"" on the part of the EU, of the dead-end austerity policy which has been exercised for the last ten years."
"Besides, those who speak of the need to safeguard the ""sustainability"" of the criteria seek solely to ensure that it is easier to harden the present policy and support the anti-grass roots measures yet to come."
"The experience of other countries already in the euro zone proves that one new measure after another is introduced in order to reverse what has been achieved over previous decades and the ""American model"" is now the example to be followed by the famous European social model."
"We, the MEPs of the ÊÊÅ, who stand by the positions to which we subscribed when the Maastricht Treaty was signed and which only the ÊÊÅ voted against when the time came to ratify it in the Greek national parliament, will be voting against Greece' s accession to the euro zone on the grounds of the workers' and Greece' s interests."
"At the same time, we and the workers shall continue to fight against this policy and to promote an alternative development policy which focuses on man and his needs and which takes the opposite line from the reactionary policies of the 'democracy of the monopolies' ."
"- (NL) I have voted in favour of the Goebbels report and, as such, for Greece' s joining the single currency."
"I have voted with just as much conviction for the amendments to the Pomés Ruiz report."
"These amendments specifically underline a sensitive issue which gave us plenty to talk about, not only in the plenary debate, but also in the Economic Committee meetings."
"Many MEPs have expressed doubts about, in particular, the sustainability of the convergence and stability policy of the Member States."
"We have all been able to see how the pleas addressed to Greece to make further efforts to reduce its debt and to obtain lasting stability do not only pertain to the situation of Greece itself, but also to the discontent about the way in which other Member States with a very high debt ratio have behaved, not making sufficient use of the options available to them, as a result of economic growth and low interest rates, to reduce the debt."
"Let us hope that Parliament' s subdued criticism gets through to the relevant parties."
"This includes the Belgian government, which has already made so many pledges that even the press is starting to question the viability of this spending impulse."
"Precisely because the hesitation expressed on the occasion of Greece' s joining the euro does not so much concern Greece as represent a general criticism, I am of the opinion that Greece should not be allowed to become the victim of this hesitation."
"Greece is welcome in euroland, and all Member States in the euro zone must respect the letter and spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Sellafield resolutions"
"Mr President, the vote on Sellafield was a first for the European Parliament."
"I think it is the first time that the European Parliament has spoken in favour of uniform safety standards for nuclear power stations."
"I believe that the Council should, as a matter of urgency, and before the first accessions take place, resolve to draw up and implement such safety standards."
"Randzio-Plath report (A5-0109/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Randzio-Plath report on the distortion of competition where public undertakings are concerned."
"When Commissioner Monti gave his response at the end of the debate, he declared that the aid provided for public undertakings must not be out of proportion with the quality of the public service provided."
"So I wonder: there are public and private television broadcasting companies in Italy, for example, where a great deal of money is allocated to the public television services."
"However, this is, in actual fact, excessive, for there is no difference between the service provided by the private broadcasting companies and that provided by the public broadcasting companies."
"This is a distortion of competition."
"Let us take another sector: state and private pensions."
"State pensions are heavily financed but provide services which are inferior to those provided by private pensions: this is not true competition."
"- (PT) On the grounds that it is necessary to identify and prevent the granting of subsidies that distort competition and to increase transparency in relations between the State and public enterprises, the Commission is creating bureaucratic arrangements and real restrictions which may undermine the delivery of high-quality public services."
"By taking as its basic philosophy the need to ensure competition between the public and private sectors, the Commission has, in fact, ended up undervaluing the important role of public enterprises which provide public services, and this is unacceptable."
"The rapporteur' s original report recognised the value of ""services of general economic interest"" , but her report was subsequently amended, particularly with regard to public broadcasting systems."
"We believe that it is right that the directive does not apply to public broadcasting organisations, in view of their specific nature, which cannot be divorced from the democratic, social and cultural needs of the various Member States, and the negative impact that this would have on their ability to fulfil their public service mission."
"This was the reasoning behind our amendment, which was unfortunately rejected."
"Resolution on poor countries' debt"
"The external debt of the developing countries poses a major challenge."
"The 50 poorest countries spend twice as much servicing their debt as they receive in aid."
"The UNCTAD report on sub-Saharan Africa shows that African countries have not received any benefit from structural adjustment programmes for over ten years."
"The proposal is very restrictive and is limited to the poorest, highly indebted countries."
"It imposes far too many conditions on the countries requiring debt relief."
"I regret any conditions which are imposed, particularly any link between debt relief and the application of structural adjustment measures."
"This is why I have abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution."
"I am in favour of very substantial debt relief for all the countries concerned and debt cancellation for the poorest ones."
"- (IT) I abstained from the vote on the joint resolution on poor countries' debt because I feel that it is wishy-washy and ambiguous in the face of the financial mechanisms known to us all which plunge the greater part of humanity into the most abject poverty."
"Today, even the multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the IMF are talking of reducing the debt, for the mechanisms stifling the economies no longer make sense, even from a neoliberal perspective."
"At the June 1999 G7 Summit, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries talked of reducing the poor countries' debt to 90%."
"If we look closely at these proposals, we see that they would not really be a solution, for if these measures were to be applied, they would only affect 8% or, at most, 10% of the debt of the 41 countries involved, which is, at the outside, 1% of the total Third World debt."
"But these same measures are given minimal application, which has tragic consequences for the indebted countries, but which benefits the creditors themselves in terms of export loans, financial bodies and multinationals, for example."
"First of all, we must acknowledge that the Third World debt is illegal."
"Therefore, the European Union should promote an international, bilateral and multilateral action cancelling the Third World debt with no conditions attached."
"The Member States must cancel the debts of the poor countries in practical terms and urge the international bodies which represent them to take similar steps."
"We must ensure that the cancellation of debts is not conditional upon cooperation, as is often the case, or linked to any sort of structural adjustment measure."
"We have to influence the financial mechanisms which caused this debt and the structural adjustment policies which continue to contribute to it, spreading poverty throughout these countries."
"Resolution on Zimbabwe"
"It is in the nature of things that the extreme right should put forward crass arguments to defend the right of 4 500 landowners of European origin to monopolise the best land in Zimbabwe."
"Yet the fact that the joint motion for a resolution calls for law and order to be enforced and condemns 'the illegal occupations' and accompanying violence is pure hypocrisy."
"We might have more faith in the sincerity of the authors of this motion in 'deploring the recent murders, beatings and intimidation associated with the ...occupation' if they at least deigned to recall the past massacres in which a handful of colonists dispossessed the indigenous population of its land and the decades of colonial violence and apartheid used to preserve this situation."
"The Mugabe regime is authoritarian and corrupt."
"Yet neither this authoritarianism nor this corruption bothered the defenders of the wealthy minority and the old colonial power until this authoritarianism was used to attack their interests and privileges."
"We have therefore not only voted against this motion but must also denounce the cynicism and hypocrisy of those who defend the interests of the privileged whites in Zimbabwe."
"It will be up to the poor population of this country to settle its account with Mugabe and his regime, and certainly not the political servants of those who have grown rich by pillaging this country."
"Paasilinna report (A5-0094/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Paasilinna report on the telecommunications regulatory package but I found it unsatisfactory as well."
"Not enough effort is being put into these European Union directives on telecommunications, if it is true that the result is that, sadly, we are still without a European television frequency and we do not yet have a European television channel or even a mere radio station. Neither Parliament nor our meetings are broadcast anywhere in Europe."
"European Union telecommunications directives ought to relate to the European Union."
"- (PT) We feel bound to criticise the assumptions underlying this report, in particular those concerning faster liberalisation of the telecommunications sector, which are founded on the basic premise that this process has brought benefits to the users of these services. We only need to look at Portugal' s experience in this respect."
"Portugal Telecom, a public enterprise which has received billions of escudos of public investment, has been partially privatised, which has led to an increase in charges to what are called 'residential users' - the majority of the population - who today face the 'highest charges in Europe' ."
"As regards the workforce, thousands of jobs have been cut, stricter working conditions have been introduced, and in many cases workers are poorly paid and have few rights. In other words, the overriding aim has been to maximise profit in a sector which is already highly profitable, and this has led to cuts in investment which have affected the quality of the overall service provided for the majority of users."
"We do not think this is the right way to proceed."
"We need a modern public telecommunications service which embraces technical and scientific progress."
"We need an affordable public service based on equal access and guaranteed users' rights - a service that forms part of balanced development."
"We also want to see improvements in conditions of employment for the workforce in this sector."
"- (SV) It is extremely important that the EU' s legislation and accompanying rules in the area of telecommunications should be updated concurrently with the explosive global development where digital and mobile communication is concerned."
"It is also important that this should take place within the framework of the conditions of the internal market and with a view to safeguarding free competition."
"In this context, the report illuminates a number of important aspects."
"What the report does not discuss, and what the Commission' s report does not take account of, either, are the different conditions prevailing in the EU' s Member States when it comes to developing and maintaining different types of network."
"When it comes to Sweden, which is sparsely populated and where there are significant distances between one locality and another, the public service element has a relatively larger role to play than elsewhere when it comes to the functions and investments of the telecommunications industry."
"Where society' s opportunities for investment and decision making are concerned, together with citizens' ability to access functioning communications networks of equal quality, the consequences of completely opening up the markets for telecommunications networks in the way described in the report are unclear."
"I therefore abstained from voting on this report."
"Alyssandrakis report (A5-0122/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for this report, which is the first Alyssandrakis report on radio frequencies, which are nowadays used chiefly to advance mobile phone communications technology."
"This directive also has some shortcomings, for there is insufficient focus on adaptation, teaching, refresher courses and the use of these new communications systems by pensioners and the elderly."
"I am not referring to pensioners and the elderly in general, but, in this case, I am referring to my mother."
"My mother lives in Rome. She is 85 years old, it is true, but I have not yet managed to persuade her to let me give her a mobile phone because she would not know how to use it."
"She would find it extremely useful and also a saving, but she will not be persuaded."
"I offered to teach her, but she refused."
"This means that the elderly are not able to benefit from progress."
"Alyssandrakis report (A5-0119/2000)"
"Mr President, in relation to the second Alyssandrakis report, I must mention my daughter."
"When I met her this morning - I did not see her last night for I was here, in this Chamber, speaking on this report - she asked me: ""But Daddy, is it true that you want to become an astronaut and go to the moon?"
"That is what they told me when I arrived here this morning."""
"I had to reply: ""Yes, it is true"" , for when I took the floor yesterday - and I repeat the request again now - I called for progress to be made in European space research and I mentioned the fact that, in the United States, there was an astronaut, a politician, who went into space at the age of 69, that is when he was a pensioner."
"I would like there to be a European astronaut, also a politician, who will become an astronaut in 15 years' time at the age of 69."
"I therefore put my name forward to become the first European Union astronaut."
"Maybe you should give your mother the spaceship and your daughter the telephone."
"Mr President, although I voted for the report, I would like the following point to be minuted."
"Coordination of European research activity must not result in competition between research institutes disappearing."
"The limits on communitarisation imposed by the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be kept in mind."
"The standardisation of rights concerning intangible assets has already proved its value in the case of trademark law and copyright."
"The present system for filing patent applications obliges the applicant to file a patent application separately in each Member State, which inevitably results in an undesirable fragmentation of the European market."
"The logical conclusion is therefore to create a Community patent."
"Decision makers at national level will have to be sufficiently far-sighted if this ambitious project is to succeed."
"The competitiveness of the entire European Union must be taken into account when research contracts are being awarded."
"Plooij-Van Gorsel report (A5-0131/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Plooij-Van Gorsel report on the communication ""Towards a European research area"" , although I would have been very pleased if the decision had at last been taken to place all the research carried out throughout Europe at various levels of government under the same umbrella. Town, provincial and regional councils all spend money on research, the individual State governments spend money on research and so does the European Union."
"All this money should be managed by a single expenditure centre: the European Union."
"I am concerned because I would like to see more research in the field of science which aims to prolong human life."
"I am concerned because I would not like the State budgets and pension agencies to try to hold back this research, which would have negative implications for them because of the greater expenditure they would incur."
"- (EL) Although there are certain positive aspects to Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s report, it is driven by the perception that the purpose of research is to serve corporate interests and produce new knowledge - mainly of commercial value - on demand, within the framework of the liberalisation of the market and of competition."
"Any research policy based on this sort of perception and which serves this sort of policy is bound to distort the nature of research as a procedure for producing new knowledge and as a productive power."
"What research basically needs is an increase in its funding, which is unacceptably low for the European Union as a whole (1.8% of GDP compared with 2.8% in the USA and 2.9% in Japan), while countries such as Greece, which is at the bottom of the EU league, spend a miserable 0.5%."
"Increased funding will allow new research activities to be developed and use to be made of the plethora of unemployed, highly-specialised young researchers, of which there is an abundance, at least in Greece."
"Funding must be provided by public agencies within the framework of research activity programmes which will support both basic research and applications, the final purpose of which should be to improve the quality of life for all mankind and not swell the coffers of the monopolies."
"International collaboration plays a primordial role in the research process, and its further development, both between the Member States of the EU and with other countries, would be both desirable and welcome."
"However, ensuring that overall research efforts in the countries of the EU serve the interests of big business, solely with a view to increasing their profits, is undesirable and constitutes a repulsive prospect for the future of mankind."
"This is why the MEPs of the ÊÊÅ shall be voting against Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s report."
"- (PT) It is important to note that despite all the declarations of intent made by the European institutions about the new economy, and despite the trend towards a digital, knowledge-based economy driven by the existence of new goods and services, the European Union' s total research effort as a function of its GDP has been in continuous decline for ten years. On average, the EU devotes just 1.8% of its GDP to research, compared with 2.8% in the USA and 2.9% in Japan."
"According to the Commission communication, the gap between total public and private expenditure on research in the USA and in the EU is continuing to widen, having grown from EUR 12 billion in 1992 to some EUR 60 billion in 1998."
"Similarly, in terms of employment, there are just 2.5 researchers for every thousand workers in European companies, compared with 6.7 per thousand in the USA and 6 per thousand in Japan."
"Yet we know that research and technology contribute between 25% and 50% to economic growth and play an important part in the competitiveness, employment and quality of life of Europe' s citizens."
"This being the case, how can the Heads of Government of the 15 Member States of the European Union pledge to achieve a new strategic objective for the next decade, that is to make the European Union the most dynamic and competitive knowledge­based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion, unless they significantly change their research policy, and particularly the budgets earmarked for this?"
"It is in this way, through public investment and guarantees to respect workers' rights, that we will achieve better levels of development, not by insisting on the liberalisation of key sectors and of essential public services or on flexible labour markets."
"Smet/Gröner report (A5-0125/2000)"
"The recognition of women' s rights as an integral and indivisible component of universal human rights requires the adoption of accompanying measures which will allow this recognition to be transposed into concrete actions."
"It also requires a subsequent evaluation of those measures, above all, so that they can be adapted in the event that they are not sufficiently effective."
"This is why the Smet-Gröner report, and the proposals contained in it, are so opportune and correct. I have therefore voted in favour of it."
"Of particular importance is the request for specific preventive measures and measures to promote women' s health and guarantee their right to genetic health, as long as this right is not understood to mean the right to abortion but rather the right to the protection of the health of the expectant mother and the unborn child."
"With regard to the promotion of equal opportunities in the context of policies on cooperation with development, I would like to point out that, in my view, efforts in this area should concentrate especially on guaranteeing girls' access to primary education, which means at the same time ensuring that it is free."
"However, I regret the fact that the amendment that I presented on behalf of the PPE has not been accepted."
"The prevention of adolescent pregnancies demands, above all, that we educate the young in the values which stem from their essential sense of self-worth and teach them to enjoy their freedom in a responsible manner."
". (PT) We voted in favour of this report because it highlights the most important aspects of our analysis of the follow-up to the Beijing Declaration and Action Platform."
"We also think that the 2000 review process should in no way lead to a renegotiation of the commitments entered into in Beijing."
"All the 12 key sectors are important and they must be tackled, given the sexual discrimination which exists in all areas, and since lack of progress in one sector will inevitably have repercussions on the other sectors."
"We also believe that it is important to hold a further conference in five years' time with a view to assessing progress for women in the fields of equality, development and peace."
"It is also of fundamental importance for the Council, the Commission and the Member States to do everything possible to combat violence against women, especially in the home, at the workplace, in society in general and in armed conflicts."
"The report by Mrs Gröner and Mrs Smet gives me the opportunity to look again at a questionable action platform."
"As well as containing a Malthusian ideology, the Beijing Action Platform uses means of implementation which we condemn."
"The UN already intends to rule the world by imposing a uniform vision, based on the western model, on all the regions of the planet, regardless of their existing cultures and laws."
"In addition, in order to bypass the rules arising from its intergovernmental nature which subjects it to approval by its Member States, the UN is using the NGOs which it finances in order to implement its programmes everywhere and with much fewer constraints."
"Where countries are reluctant, it is using blackmail based on financial aid to obtain the application, for example, of birth control measures."
"Although it is vital for the specific role of women to be recognised in all societies, this must occur with full respect for the local traditions and regulations which are commonly accepted and which do not in any way prevent the dignity of women from being respected."
"Such an approach ensures that the people concerned have a better understanding of these broad international texts."
"We have also discussed and voted on Mrs Sörensen' s report which deals with trafficking in women."
"These two debates should make us stop and think about the real scope and aim of these major international platforms."
"While they have succeeded in their aim of weakening still further the demography of western countries, they have not responded in a logical way to the more urgent question of protecting those women who are really in difficulty."
"Once again, it is the ideology and egoism of some which have prevailed over concern for the common good. The culture of death has taken priority over the defence of life."
"- The British Conservative Members decided to abstain in our vote on this report."
"This should not be construed at all that we are not opposed to discrimination."
"We are opposed to discrimination, we do believe in equality of treatment between men and women."
"We do not accept, however, that the imposition of legal quotas is the way to achieve equality of treatment."
"Quite the reverse."
"We think quotas of themselves institutionalise discrimination."
"We believe that women the world over and especially here in Europe are making a valuable and positive contribution to the democratic process."
"We are convinced that role will develop fully and effectively without 'progressive' or 'artificial means' ."
"On the issue of making contraceptives more widely available we voted against the amendment because we believe these are issues of personal morality and conscience and not an issue where the European Union should be making a political stand."
"For these reasons we voted against certain amendments and abstained on the final vote."
"- According to the World Health Organisation, the definition of the term ""Reproductive Health"" includes the term ""fertility regulation"" which contains ""interrupting unwanted pregnancies"" , i.e. abortion on demand."
"In the interest of subsidiarity, paragraphs and related amendments dealing with reproductive health should not be included in an EP document, unless clearly and honestly defined."
"There is a worldwide commonly agreed terminology which is ""Primary Health Care"" defined at the WHO conference in Alma Ata, 1978, which deals with Women and Mother' s Health without including abortion on demand."
"Furthermore, in paragraph 18, the use of language leaves the meaning unclear and open to interpretation; prevention of ""girl pregnancies"" has the unfortunate double meaning of specifically seeking to prevent pregnancies where the conceived child is a girl."
"Ambiguities such as this should not be allowed to stand in a report conceived as instructions for the negotiating team in New York for the remainder of the Beijing +5 session."
"Regarding paragraph 26, which states that ""the respect of women's rights should be one of the main conditions for the granting of aid and should be closely monitored in all external relations and cooperation"" , the European Union must not tie any specifications to its distribution of aid nor impose any conditions for the reception of aid amongst women, realising that women are extremely vulnerable to the use of coercion and coercive techniques in order to realise their basic human rights such as shelter, nutrition, education and basic health care."
"The EU must exercise extreme caution that current definitions should be consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as women are not a minority group."
"The report on the follow-up to the Beijing Action Platform notes that the situation of women, although improved, still involves major inequalities."
"In terms of work, it would appear vital to do more than just evaluate 'the impact of part-time and atypical forms of working on [...] the increase in poverty among women' ."
"Women often actually do not have the option of choosing a properly paid full-time job, yet 85% would like one."
"Being forced into part-time work is clearly a source of poverty which is why we oppose this."
"The wage gap between men and women of around 30% still remains."
"On this issue, the report should have introduced coercive measures to eliminate this state of affairs. This would, of course, require a political will."
"Finally, over one thousand women' s associations in 140 countries are this year organising a world march to fight against continuing violence and to fight for equality."
"It is our duty to support them."
"We have therefore voted in favour of this report despite its limitations and we will demonstrate in Paris on 17 June together with all those who are fighting for equality and women' s rights."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.48 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Equal treatment"
"The next item is the report (A5-0136/2000) by Mrs Buitenweg, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (COM(1999) 566 - C5­0067/2000 - 1999/0253(CNS))."
"Mr President, it was fifty years ago last week that Robert Schuman, with his speech, laid the foundation for the ECSC."
"Meanwhile, coal and steel have ceased being the cornerstones of the integration process."
"Over the past six months, it has become evident that values are increasingly at the centre of the debate."
"Europe as a Community of values."
"The importance of the directive which we are debating today threatens to become lost in the commotion about the time of issue of the French translation, the deadline for the amendments and our Rules of Procedure, whilst its very content will probably explain why we are all fighting so hard."
"A couple of months ago, when the content had still not been specified, all parties agreed to a swift passage of this directive."
"During the Portuguese Presidency, there has been a political momentum within the Council of which I, as well as other MEPs, would have liked to have made use."
"Technical problems were deemed subordinate to political will at the time, and this is still true for the majority of MEPs."
"Therefore, in addition to the draftspeople of the opinion, I would also like to thank a number of people by name for their extremely constructive contributions to the report."
"They are Mr Richard Howitt, rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Anne Van Lancker, Mrs Joke Swiebel, Mrs Sarah Ludford and Mr Arie Oostlander."
"I would now like to move on to the Commission' s proposal."
"It embodies a sound minimum level of protection against racism by means of sanctions and independent bodies, by which we set great store."
"The Commissioner has done justice to the wide range of areas across which discrimination can manifest itself."
"The directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination, as well as the term ""harassment"" ."
"My report also calls for the inclusion of incitement to discrimination."
"This is, for example, the case if an employer asks a headhunting agency to be selective on improper grounds."
"I hope that this addition can be adopted by the Commission."
"Parliament has also looked very carefully into the areas to which this directive applies."
"I have understood that some people in the Council are in favour of excluding asylum and migration policy, as well as the issuing of visas, from this ban on discrimination."
"I hope that I have got the wrong end of the stick here."
"Indeed, although a distinction based on nationality may be completely understandable, it would, of course, be quite improper to let the colour of someone' s skin be a deciding factor in their request for asylum or to treat the asylum request of a black person in distress differently from that of a white person."
"These days, asylum and migration policy falls within the scope of the first pillar. The deliberate exclusion of this area could not therefore be justified."
"A much-debated topic in this Parliament is the burden of proof."
"Every Member State is by now familiar with this concept, whereby both the defendant and plaintiff have a role to play."
"Indeed, the burden of proof has already shifted in cases where men and women are treated equally."
"In this procedure, the plaintiff has to supply actual facts on the basis of which direct or indirect discrimination can be presumed, and the defendant subsequently needs to refute the charges."
"This arrangement works well and has caused few problems."
"Maybe those opposing this procedure could explain to me sometime during this debate why we nonetheless have to review it and, more specifically, why there is less protection against racial discrimination than against sex discrimination."
"At the same time, I recognise the fact that even more protection is not essential."
"I hope therefore that the House, in its wisdom, will decide tomorrow to adhere as far as possible to the Commission' s original text."
"Unfortunately, statutory measures against racism are necessary."
"They provide victims with protection and a right to redress."
"But it is also important in the forming of attitudes."
"It makes it clear that Europe will not stand for racism."
"It is this message which this Parliament needs to broadcast."
"Everyone is different, everyone is equal."
"I note what you have said, Mr Ribeiro e Castro."
"I do not think it was strictly speaking a point of order, but I have taken note of it."
"President, as co-rapporteur for this, Europe' s first ever race directive, I and my party are proud to contribute to legislation which establishes common standards of protection for the victims of racial discrimination throughout our continent."
"This will send a clear signal to the racist extreme right that they have no part in modern Europe and it closes the chapter of racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia which tragically blighted our history in the century just past."
"Racism is not an opinion - it is a crime."
"The 24-year old black care worker set on fire in a racist attack in Britain, the 5 neo-Nazis convicted of beating two Vietnamese people in Germany, the French authorities cited by Amnesty International for torture of a Moroccan-Dutch national, all of which took place in Europe this very week are simply the most visible examples of racial discrimination which is the daily experience of black and ethnic minority Europeans in our businesses, communities and on our streets."
"For example, the group from Watford in my constituency whom I met just last week, were witness to racist intimidation at a border post, which is sadly too routine even to be reported."
"Let me be clear - today the European Parliament places on record our belief that this legislation will concretely tackle such racism."
"The shift in the burden of proof because the discriminator holds all of the information will guarantee greater fairness in the way that complaints are heard."
"The definition of indirect discrimination will enable covert action which is more pervasive, more insidious to be challenged and will permit implementation by genuinely independent bodies with sufficient funds to do their work so that our words are turned into reality."
"The Commission for Racial Equality from the UK is just one example in Europe and I am pleased that some of the best lessons of the UK' s Race Relations Act alongside best practice from other Member States are being translated into European law today."
"The European Parliament should be aware that the elements I have outlined are intrinsic to the legislation and that Mrs Buitenweg and myself have come to a clear understanding with the Portuguese Presidency that, in return for our cooperation in accelerating parliamentary approval, those elements will form a minimum in the final directive agreed."
"Let me turn to the specific improvements we propose and which we expect to be accepted: that incitement or pressure to discriminate is banned just as much as the discrimination itself; that groups as well as individuals will be able to bring cases including a legal status for voluntary organisations to engage in civil dialogue, a partnership to implement the directive for the first time; that the scope of the new law is clearly applied to all public authorities; that conciliation is offered to resolve disputes without prejudice to the right of access to the courts; and that the effectiveness of the new law is tested one to two years, not five, following its implementation."
"In addition, I ask the Commissioner to address specifically in her reply our additional demands for application of the principles of the directive in the policies and programmes of the EU itself."
"Second, to give public authorities the right to require companies to demonstrate compliance with anti-discrimination in awarding contracts."
"Third, on the importance of statistical monitoring, if we are genuinely to combat discrimination."
"Finally, I offer my sincere congratulations to Kathalijne Buitenweg for her work and I thank her for her cooperation in bringing this before Parliament."
"Members should all acknowledge the campaign by the anti-racist movement throughout Europe."
"National groups such as the UK Race and Europe Network in my country, the European Network against Racism and, in particular, the Starting Line group have worked for 20 years to get this legislation and for them today is still simply the beginning."
"Mr President, I want to add my voice to those Members calling for the swift passage of this legislation through Parliament."
"This is a Parliament with a proud record."
"Since the 1980s we have led on action and on initiatives to combat racism, xenophobia and discrimination."
"We now have, in the Buitenweg report, a unique opportunity to see those efforts incorporated into a package of legislation and an action plan."
"I want to thank the rapporteur for incorporating the amendment by the Committee on Legal Affairs to extend the proposal to cover institutional racism."
"We, too, believe that we have to see a ban on incitement to racism."
"Groups and anti-racist organisations in my region, in the North-West of England, are eagerly awaiting this legislation."
"For some of them, victims of racism, action cannot come quick enough and PPE pleading on respecting parliamentary procedure, I am afraid, will fall on deaf ears in my region' s organisations."
"Racism is on the rise again."
"We all have our local examples."
"For example, in Liverpool an Asian scriptwriter was attacked, his car forced off the road and local thugs then tried to impale him on a fence spike."
"So vicious was this attack that Merseyside police called for an urgent press conference."
"The Jewish community in North Manchester are persistently the subject of victimisations and racism, their property defaced and they are subjected to racial threats and abuse."
"This has to stop."
"This is why it is vital that Europe gives a strong public statement on racism and discrimination backed up by legislative action to ban this and to extend the scope of legal redress by shifting the burden of proof from the victim to the racist and allied groups and organisations to bring race discrimination cases to courts across the EU."
"In voting through this report and its recommendations, this Parliament can give a strong signal that it is prepared to be tough on racism and tough on the causes and perpetrators of racism."
"Those parties which seek to legitimise and promote racism and discrimination through the ballot box, and we have examples in many countries, should take note of this directive and incorporate the recommendations and its legal force in their own constitutions."
"Firstly, I want to congratulate the Commission on this text."
"It is a good text."
"Many of the basic principles we wanted to see are in it."
"I also congratulate the Portuguese Presidency because they have pushed this through and given it their political clout to make sure we get it on the statute book because, as Mrs McCarthy has just said, people who are victims of racism cannot wait until all the procedures are sorted out."
"They want this legislation quickly and they want it now."
"That is why it is important that we vote this afternoon."
"It is important legislation."
"In the context of what has happened in Austria, it becomes even more important."
"There are a few things which would add to and strengthen the text."
"Two things I would like to highlight: Amendment No 29, which tries to make sure that there is no hiding place for racism, no hiding place behind considerations of religion, considerations of belief and considerations of nationality."
"We need to make sure that these are not just covers for racism."
"The second amendment, which is important, is the amendment on incitement to racial discrimination which is as important as the act of racism itself, and I hope the Commission will take it on board."
"My own committee, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, thought it particularly important that we make sure that the applicant states are aware of the legislation and are in a position to implement it as soon as possible."
"I hope the Commission will make sure in the Action Programme, proposed to accompany this package, that we have a lot of projects from the applicant states."
"This directive will have a direct impact on the lives of many constituents of mine in Yorkshire, people from ethnic minorities and many thousands of people across Europe."
"It is very important that we get it through today."
"I hope that at the end of the afternoon we will have no more shenanigans, no more delays and we will make sure we get the vote at 6 p.m. so that we can get it through before the end of the Portuguese Presidency."
"Mr President, first and foremost, I would like to warmly congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on the fact that she managed to finish the entire report, ready for discussion and vote, at the eleventh hour today."
"That is the first point."
"When I read the report and hear the discussions, I get a strong feeling of déjà vu."
"Some 15 or 20 years ago in the Netherlands, I worked together with a Christian-Democrat member of government, Mrs Jeltien Kraaieveld, who was also involved in this anti-discrimination legislation in the field of discrimination based on sex."
"All the points raised then, together with the hesitation and conflicts, have come up again now."
"The hesitation mainly relates to what should and should not be included in the one report."
"Then, too, we realised that it is better to address the types of discrimination one by one than to try to cram them all into one act or even one directive."
"In addition, the rapporteur has persuaded me that it is preferable to leave out religion for that reason, because it merits a separate chapter."
"What would really cap it all for me is if we could withdraw Amendments Nos 15 and 29, in which religion is portrayed in a bad light."
"This would then render my Amendment No 63 redundant, where religion is seen in a positive light, as we would thus redress the balance and have a clean report."
"Mr President, I think it is important in this context to bring up the issue of the 'distribution of the burden of proof' , also erroneously referred to as 'reversal of burden of proof' ."
"In the past, we have had huge arguments in the Netherlands about how this should be done and whether this could be done."
"We finally concluded that it was necessary and that it should also be tied in with the establishment of an independent council or independent committee for equal treatment - in fact, one of my best former collaborators currently forms part of such a committee."
"This would then be able to look into the extent to which particular complaints should be taken seriously, whereupon we would go to court and, if appropriate, support the plaintiff."
"It is then up to the party which is indicted to prove that we are wrong."
"That is the type of distribution of the burden of proof which is not only already operational in most Member States in the case of men and women and, as from 2001, will have to be extended to include everybody, but which also already exists in legislation on the environment, for example."
"There, too, a reversal of the burden of proof applies, if necessary, or so I was told by an expert in the field a moment ago."
"Indeed, these are phenomena which are extremely difficult to prove and which, using the traditional method, an interested party can try to wriggle out of, usually successfully, even if this is completely unjustified."
"It is to be welcomed if legislation develops in this respect."
"The distribution of the burden of proof is an important point which should be looked into by a committee such as the one mentioned above. As such, on behalf of those in my Group who welcome this, I am strongly in favour of the parts of the report which pertain to this point."
"It is, of course, the case that in the traditional forms of administration of justice, some employers or people playing important roles used to be in a strong position, or those forming part of a majority always took exception to anti-discrimination."
"Distribution of the burden of proof will affect their position."
"As a Christian-Democrat, I think we have to side with those who are most under threat, those in the weakest position. As such, this is a positive development, in my view."
"Also, I very much applaud the rapporteur' s compromise to the effect that she is possibly prepared to reinstate in their original form those regulations which have been tightened up in ways not required by statute."
"I consider this to be an important gesture, also vis-à-vis the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and this I very much appreciate."
"Regarding the other points of the report, I do have to say that the nature of a directive is such that you do not need to be too specific."
"A directive needs to be incorporated into national legislation."
"Naturally, one could say, what if some EU government or other lost its faculties, you would need to specify all the steps one by one."
"I assume, Mr President, pursuant to the principles of subsidiarity, that this kind of mental breakdown will not affect Member States and that they will transpose this directive into national legislation in a proper and reasonable manner, so as to meet the objective."
"This is, after all, the nature of the directive."
"This does imply for our Group - and I am speaking on behalf of the entire group - that a number of points are redundant, something which, in fact, the rapporteur has already hinted at."
"Let us weed them out and exclude them from the directive."
"In addition, we do not need to include a number of bureaucratic procedures of how everything needs to be done step by step."
"We will not be voting in favour of this, or rather, we will be voting against this."
"But this does not affect the core of the report, Mr President, which is what this is all about."
"Needless to say, there are a number of points which we do want included, such as, for example, the right to perusal of confidential information, or whether it is, for example, necessary to establish whether a business administration is not secretly committing systematic discrimination."
"On behalf of part of my Group, I also find it extremely important that elections of employees representatives are clearly provided for."
"Naturally, these too should be held free from discrimination based on race or ethnic origin."
"We must strike up a social dialogue where this type of issue can be discussed."
"This very much strengthens the concept of subsidiarity because, where anti-discrimination is concerned, we should start at the basis, the very place where social dialogue is extremely pertinent."
"Mr President, discrimination, especially based on ethnicity and race, is of great concern to me because it touches the very core of the European Union and European integration."
"This is what it is all about."
"We are gathered here, people from different nations and of different origins, and we are working together."
"This is what the pioneers of the European Union once did and we must translate this now into legislation such as is before us today."
"As a Dutch person, I have to say that I am also moved by the discrimination issue involving generations of Dutch speakers, often fellow believers, who kept the apartheid regime in South Africa alive."
"This has made us particularly alert and, in my opinion, we should take the warning we received from this historic learning process seriously."
"I am delighted that this subject is now being discussed in a proper manner."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am a Member of the group which has joined forces with the two rapporteurs, Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg and Mr Richard Howitt, with a great deal of conviction in order to enable Parliament to deliver the parliamentary opinion on this Commission proposal this week, and I would like to thank the rapporteurs very explicitly and with all my heart for the extremely constructive spirit in which we have been able to work."
"The Social Democrats in Parliament have fought doggedly to keep this item on the agenda and I am pleased that we managed to achieve this thanks to a sound proposal for compromise from the Liberals."
"With all due sympathy and respect for the work which Mr Arie Oostlander and a number of delegates in the PPE-DE Group have put into this in order to win that group over too, I have to say that the continuous attempts at sabotage and procedural games which we have experienced here this week are, as far as I am concerned, proof that a hard core of conservative PPE-DE Members want nothing more than to undermine this report and the directive."
"I am pleased, however, that we managed to stop them in their tracks."
"We all know that the Portuguese Presidency is determined to bring this debate in the Council to a successful conclusion."
"This will not be easy."
"The majority of MEPs know very well why this directive is important."
"By implementing the Treaty' s non-discrimination principle swiftly and forcefully, Europe wants to give out an unambiguous message to the citizens in our own countries and those in the candidate countries."
"This is to prove that Europe is serious about the fight for equal opportunities, irrespective of people' s race or ethnic origin and also because it is a well-known fact that discrimination is still rife in our countries, and that there is still racism and extreme nationalism which, in fact, is more prominent than before because racist political parties are cashing in on the 'own nation first' ideas."
"I know that the debate in the Council is also a difficult one."
"It is precisely for this reason that it is important that the European Parliament strengthens and supports the Commission's position, because we will soon need a sound and efficient directive which fights any type of discrimination on the basis of racial and ethnic origin."
"To finish off, I would like to highlight a number of my Group' s priorities in terms of content."
"Firstly, it is extremely important for the non-discrimination directive to have a wide and efficient scope."
"This is why we are very much in favour of extending the directive to groups of people who are discriminated against and also to areas such as housing, education, public service operations and attitudes within the police force."
"We are also pleased with the solution which we finally reached regarding discrimination on the basis of religion which should not be a covert reason for discriminating on the basis of ethnic origin."
"Secondly, in our opinion, the strength of this directive will stand or fall with its enforceability, the extent to which it monitors discrimination, the efficiency of the measures taken against discrimination and, as such, the importance we attach to the possibility of organising collective actions to tie sanctions in with the directive."
"With all due respect and sympathy, Mr Oostlander, but since you refer to the cleaning-up operation, I notice that this is precisely one of those cornerstones of our reinforcement plan which is being removed. I do not agree with this."
"This is taking it much too far."
"Moreover, my Group also supports the reinforcement of, and support for, the operation of, those independent monitoring bodies."
"I am convinced that the centre for equal opportunities in my own country will be encouraged in its activities by this directive."
"I should like to finish off with one last consideration regarding the shared burden of proof because I am really at a loss to understand the resistance on the part of some people."
"Surely it should be clear to everybody that it is impossible for a migrant who is discriminated against to prove that he is being discriminated against at work or by house owners, unless the defendant too is at least asked to prove that the facts brought by the plaintiff are unfounded."
"We women are already familiar with this procedure."
"This is why we have fought for such a long time for a directive which distributes this burden of proof, and all we men and women of the Group of the Party of European Socialists are asking for is for migrants to be treated in the same way as women."
"This is why we will also support the Commission' s proposal and will not permit any amendments in this area."
"Welcome"
"I have just been told that we have a delegation from the City Council of Munich, the capital of the Land of Bavaria, in the public gallery."
"It is my great pleasure to welcome our colleagues from local government, and I am delighted that you are so interested in our work!"
"Equal treatment (continuation)"
"I am delighted to have been able to work with Mrs Buitenweg."
"She has done an excellent and inclusive job producing a balanced text, which usefully strengthens the Commission' s hand."
"This proposed directive is a landmark for Europe."
"It is right that Europe should be legislating to guarantee the fundamental right to dignity, irrespective of ethnicity, and not to suffer discrimination."
"It is also timely for Europe to legislate now with the alarming rise in the Far Right and racist violence."
"I want to highlight a few aspects of the text."
"Firstly, the very significant inclusion of indirect and institutional racism, and amendments have strengthened that aspect."
"Secondly, the specific inclusion of housing, health and other public authority functions, including policing."
"This is not interference in national responsibilities, but an assertion that the non-discriminatory delivery of these services is a European concern."
"Thirdly, the inclusion via Amendments Nos 15 and 29 of disguised race discrimination."
"My Group is not favourable to the inclusion of religion or belief in the scope of this directive because that needs much more thought."
"However, we believe unequal treatment should be caught if it only pretends to be based on religion or nationality but is, in fact, race discrimination pure and simple."
"Fourthly, the inclusion, as has already been mentioned, of incitement or pressure to discriminate - that is very important."
"Fifthly, the role of the European Union Monitoring Centre in assisting the Commission in monitoring the implementation of this directive - and I hope the Commission will welcome that."
"Sixthly, although my Group understands the thinking behind Amendment No 38, the fact that it includes private clubs or associations is rather problematical."
"To give you an example: I represent London and it could mean a problem for Caribbean people getting together to reminisce about life in the Caribbean in the 1950s if some white people were excluded."
"I think that Amendment No 38 is not well drafted."
"Lastly, on the adjustment of the burden of proof, and I am borrowing Mr Oostlander' s phrase here, because he is quite correct to refer to it as 'sharing' or a 'distribution' of the burden of proof."
"I am rather sorry that the Socialist Group insist on calling it a l of the burden of proof because that is slightly misleading."
"It applies to the limited circumstances of equal opportunities law which is civil or administrative law."
"My Group agrees that since the employer authority has most of the information, it must prove there has been no breach of equal treatment once the complainant has demonstrated a case."
"Finally, there will be more heat than light from some speakers today and I am afraid I might include Mr Helmer of whose remarks I had a foretaste last night on the way back from the delightful asparagus dinner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three years after the Treaty of Amsterdam was adopted and the famous and much-debated Article 13 was introduced, the Council is proposing two directives to implement the principles of this Treaty."
"We can only congratulate the Council' s willingness to make progress on this issue, particularly at a time when certain parties of the traditional right are starting to sign agreements with extreme-right movements. This has already happened in France, is now occurring in Austria and may soon happen in Italy."
"The definition of a minimum European framework for the fight against discrimination is therefore urgently required."
"The directive on the fight against racial and ethnic discrimination is heading in the right direction. In particular, it provides for the reversal of the burden of proof, the gradual establishment of positive discrimination - more effective than simple theoretical equality - and the recognition of indirect discrimination."
"All these aspects reveal a clear desire to forge ahead."
"However, certain shortcomings must be highlighted."
"Some of these have been raised by our rapporteur, such as the issue of legal proceedings being free of charge for plaintiffs and the necessary extension of the right to take part in court proceedings to groups and associations."
"There are also two other problems which I must raise."
"The first is of a general nature."
"How can the Council consider the issue of racial and ethnic discrimination without being committed to the creation of a comprehensive legislative framework for all discrimination?"
"Singling out one type of discrimination gives the impression that some types of discrimination are less reprehensible than others."
"This is unacceptable."
"A second directive on discrimination at work is to be examined shortly."
"The Council must therefore make haste and propose a draft directive encompassing all types of discrimination."
"This is absolutely vital as the most excluded are those who suffer several types of discrimination."
"Protecting them from just one type will only go part-way towards helping them."
"The second problem concerns the exclusion of religious discrimination from this directive."
"It is extremely regrettable that religious discrimination was not included with racial and ethnic discrimination as these different types of discrimination are closely linked."
"For example, how do you define the Jewish identity?"
"Surely the hatred for Jews which remains significant in many countries is due as much to anti-Semitism, and therefore to ethnic origin, as to religious aspects."
"Discrimination against North African communities in Europe is also two-sided."
"It may even often be said that the fear of Islam acts as a catalyst for racism towards these communities."
"Therefore, limiting this directive to racial and ethnic discrimination risks leaving the door open to ambiguities in interpretation with which the courts might struggle to deal."
"To conclude, it is essential that the Council adopts an integrated approach towards the legal tools to be established in order to apply Article 13 in our daily life."
"Dividing the fight against discrimination among a number of texts is dangerous for the overall coherence of the anti-discrimination mechanism and therefore weakens it."
"Mr President, thank you for welcoming the members of local government who are the very people who will have to implement what we decide here."
"But first of all, we have to do our work."
"I would like to point out that the amendments mentioned by Baroness Ludford are still not available in all languages this afternoon."
"Before we proceed to the vote, would you please get the Sittings Service to establish whether the 24-hour deadline applies here and whether or not we have to defer this until tomorrow?"
"I am not trying to start a debate on this subject now, but I would like you to clarify this once and for all, because there has been a lot of confusion here today."
"Mr Posselt, we are used to confusion reigning in this House, but I will have this checked."
"Mr President, this motion is positive and we will vote for it. However, its credibility will only be ensured if the Member States start by cleaning up their own acts."
"For example, what credibility does Belgium have in this area when it is expelling large numbers of gypsy asylum-seekers to Slovakia and Bulgaria, despite Parliament' s recommendations and the express request of the European Court of Human Rights?"
"What credibility do the Member States have when they are discriminating in their civil services against the recruitment of third country nationals, thus condemning the immigrants who they do employ to constant uncertainty?"
"What credibility does France have when a draft constitutional act recommending that immigrants from third countries be given the right to vote in local elections, adopted in the National Assembly on 3 May, is now being blocked by the hostility of the Senate and the President and the unwillingness of the government?"
"How can we claim to be protecting from discrimination those to whom we refuse any citizenship?"
"Discrimination will only be effectively combated when governments stop using double talk."
"However, this text is a step forward on which we must build."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it would have been a good thing if the European Parliament had made a positive, informative and decisive contribution to the proposal for a Council directive, in line with the impetus given by the Portuguese Presidency."
"Unfortunately, it is not evident that that has happened."
"On some points, the amendments involve precise improvements to the text in question."
"In addition to details, I myself wish to refer to the right of collective action, legal assistance and other aspects which are already covered by Portuguese law."
"However, in key areas, the amendments that we are debating could potentially wreck everything."
"It seems that the rapporteurs and others who support them have wanted to go too far, and in their desire to do so they may seriously affect the entire proposal."
"There are three points that particularly worry us: the reversal of the burden of proof, which has not been clarified, and the issues of nationality and religion."
"Reversal of the burden of proof is already a very sensitive matter in its own right."
"Even so, there are areas in which it is clearly justified, but it is unacceptable that instead of applying the classic principle of in dubio pro reo, this is to be replaced by a principle of in dubio pro auctore, especially when there is no explanation as to whether this reversal is to apply to criminal justice cases, and we know that there are cases in this area that can come under the criminal justice system."
"This would amount to a violation of the fundamental principles of our legal system and of basic rights of trial formulated in Latin, that is to say based on Roman law."
"Secondly, there is the issue of nationality."
"We Portuguese can perhaps boast the richest mix of blood and ethnic origins in the course of history."
"I myself and my circle of friends have not the faintest idea of our ethnic background."
"We would be a real puzzle for a Nazi investigator or for the chart of ethnic origins which Baroness Ludford admired so much a few weeks ago in another report."
"We are familiar with the concept of racism, which has no impact on us, although we must combat it."
"Above all, we must firmly combat racist violence."
"But it is important not to confuse separate issues."
"In other words, ethnicity is one issue and nationality is another."
"If there is discrimination between a black person and a white person, or vice versa, for example if someone discriminates against a white Portuguese in favour of a black Portuguese, or against a black Portuguese in favour of a white Portuguese, this is clearly unlawful racism and should result in prosecution."
"However, when it comes to applying for a particular post, if a Portuguese, be he Asian, black or white, is suitable for that job, in a way that does not apply to a Zimbabwean, be he Asian, black or white, then this is not a question of racism, it is about citizenship, and this can be legitimate."
"The problem is that in many of the amendments these two concepts are confused, with potentially disastrous effects, particularly in areas such as public service, and even in other, unexpected areas."
"The other vital area is religion."
"We wish to make it clear that freedom of religious organisation is a fundamental civil right, which cannot be undermined, curbed or jeopardised, which would be the effect of some of the amendments before us."
"Mr President, first of all, we would like to thank the rapporteur for improving upon the Commission' s proposal, but we also feel that particular thanks should go to Commissioner Diamantopoulou for grasping the significance of the inclusion of Article 13 in the Treaties and her skill in converting an abstract norm into a package of directives."
"With each passing day, Europe is becoming a continent which, as the United Nations' reports on the European population trend illustrate, is host to citizens of third States but which, above all, needs their contribution, their culture, their potential and their initiatives."
"In a context such as this, the Union must reaffirm the fundamental principles of democracy and ensure that all citizens and residents have the same rights and the same duties."
"Having said that, we are sceptical about three points in the report and the directive: we are completely against the principle of the reversal of the burden of proof, which is contrary to fundamental legal principles."
"We do not believe that the end justifies the means but that the means prefigure the end."
"Moreover, we do not support the creation of independent bodies in the Member States, which would be responsible for monitoring racial and ethnic discrimination."
"This is because, in general terms, we do not have confidence in institutions which, in violation of the democratic principle of the separation of powers, interfere with other institutions, with the result that they either upset the balance between the legislative, executive and judicial authorities or they find themselves without a specific function because everything is already being done by other institutions."
"Finally, we do not agree with the references to positive discrimination."
"We are opposed to positive discrimination in general when it is State-imposed, for we feel that merit should take precedence over the quota policy which, when all is said and done, discriminates between individuals who want to fight that very discrimination."
"With these reservations, the Members of the Bonino List will support the report and the directive, in the hope that the European Parliament and the Commission will reflect upon the points we have raised and make the appropriate amendments."
"Mr President, it is with mixed feelings that I am making my contribution to this debate."
"This is largely to do with the way in which the discussion of this report has been forced upon us, against normal procedures."
"Needless to say, I subscribe to the importance of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin."
"But it is precisely because this is such an important topic that Parliament, and especially the Portuguese Presidency, would have done well to have set more time aside for it."
"The enactment of the general act on equal treatment cost the Netherlands blood, sweat and tears at the time."
"I am sure that other Member States have had similar experiences and these experiences should remind us to exercise caution and do our homework before discussing this draft directive."
"This will require the necessary time, not least because the implementation of the current proposal will have a ripple effect within existing legislation and systems within the different Member States."
"The change in the burden of proof is just one example of this."
"Parliament' s amendment takes the Commission' s proposal one step further."
"The Commission specifies that the principle of subsidiarity is still being enforced, but I question that."
"The directive is said to have a supplementary function with regard to the political signal it sends out."
"But this type of signal is being emitted with just as much power by long-standing national legislation, which is a great deal closer to the citizen, and by the widely known ECHR."
"An in-depth discussion would have been desirable, certainly given the far-reaching consequences which this legislation can have on legislation and legal systems within the Member States and the fact that it will infringe on the Member States' sovereignty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dismayed as I am about the way the 14 Member States have prejudged Austria, I particularly welcome the Commission proposal."
"It goes without saying that the principle of equal treatment of persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin should be applied."
"There is no place for discrimination on these grounds in a modern society."
"However, it is possible to overshoot the mark, even in the case of such an uncontroversial issue."
"The reversal of the burden of proof proposed by the Commission would mean imposing an intolerable burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises in particular, as they would in future have to keep a record of every job interview, so that in serious cases they would be able to provide proof."
"Arrangements like this do not result in greater understanding for the victims of discrimination."
"Quite the opposite - it actually harms the cause."
"The precision of the impact assessment form annexed to the Commission proposal is totally dependent on the use of the phrase ""without apparent difficulty"" ."
"The wording is as follows: ""identical rules have already been applied without apparent difficulty"" ."
"Mr President, I think that it is important and that it will simplify the debate if the honourable members know how the Commission has dealt with Parliament' s proposal, as far as the acceptance of amendments is concerned."
"As the House knows, I - as the Commissioner responsible - presented an anti-discrimination package a few months ago, containing two directives and a programme."
"Today we are discussing one of these two directives and, allow me to say that this is only possible thanks to the brilliant collaboration and highly efficient work of the two parliamentary committees, the endeavours of which, I think, surpass all expectations."
"This particularly complicated directive, which has multiple repercussions, involves national peculiarities and different views, and to which all the committees involved have made various contributions, has evolved into a report and a consensus has been found."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt and everyone else involved, as well as the Portuguese Presidency."
"I believe that this conference is of historic importance for two reasons: first, because the demand for this sort of legislative act was tabled over twenty years ago."
"Social groups, political parties, parliaments, MEPs and international conferences have proposed and have insisted that we legislate against the huge issue of racism and the conduct of organised society."
"Twenty years on, it is now coming true."
"We are here discussing this directive."
"The second reason is that, because of the current political climate, because of the political problems which have arisen within the Union over recent months in connection with racist clashes at political and social level, today' s piece of work is the first to go beyond words, to go beyond resolutions and general political expression to specific policy making."
"The European Commission has worked quickly following the presentation of your committee' s report, with the collaboration of all the services involved, and I am pleased to say that over half the amendments have been accepted either in spirit or in part."
"I must stress that the amendments which have not been accepted have mainly been rejected for administrative or legal reasons or because we know from our experience and from our collaboration over the years that the Council is sure to reject them."
"As you know, our basis is Article 13 and it is an article which limits our room for manoeuvre."
"I should like to comment on a number of amendments."
"I am pleased to say that we agree with the amendments to incorporate the sexual dimension (Amendments Nos 7 and 59), the amendments to the material and personal scope (Amendments Nos 5, 30, 31, 34, 36 and 37) and the amendment on taking positive action (Amendment No 40)."
"We also agree with the idea of conciliation procedures in Amendment No 42, consultation with governmental organisations (Amendments Nos 21, 50 and 51) and with the amendments relating to previous acts of the European Parliament and the Council (Amendments Nos 3, 4, 8, 9 and 12)."
"I also agree with your proposal to define the role of the European Monitoring Centre - as contained in Amendment No 59 - although I should point out that our experience at the Commission tells us that the submission of reports by Member States every two years is a particularly demanding task and will not enable us to correctly assess the impact of the policies developed."
"You also propose to amend the definition of indirect discrimination and one of the speakers also mentioned this."
"I agree with the points made in the amendments and you may be sure that we shall use them to help formulate the definition in line with the interpretation of the European Court of Justice in the O' Flynn case."
"I should like to say a few words to clarify the article on balancing the burden of proof proposed in amendment 43, even though the debate and the Council have made it clear that there will be problems in getting it accepted."
"However, I should like to point out - because the Commission agrees with this approach - that a similar discussion was held several years ago along the same lines on the subject of discrimination between the sexes."
"At that time, too, there was a great deal of concern about the repercussions which this would also have in the courts, where it was feared that a large number of cases would be filed, and in companies."
"After many years in application, we have seen that these fears were unfounded and that there were no problems."
"I think, therefore, that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach."
"I agree - and I welcome your persistence - that the directive should apply to all persons present on the territory of the Member States and not only to Community citizens."
"I also agree with the proposal to make it clear that the directive will apply to natural and legal persons, but I must point out that your reference to non-formalised groups of persons cannot be incorporated because this concept is not legally recognised."
"The content of the concept is understandable on merit, but it has not yet been legally recognised and will cause numerous problems."
"I should also like to refer to an issue which appears to be of particular importance to the House; I refer to the distinction between racial and ethnic origin on the one hand and religious conviction on the other."
"Long discussions were held in the Commission when the proposal was drawn up as to whether a ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion should be included in this directive."
"We understand the argument that it is often difficult to make a clear distinction."
"This frequently applies in the workplace, mainly because there are problems in relation to prayer facilities, obtaining permission for religious events and special dietary requirements in the workplace, which is why the second directive in the package, which relates to employment issues and discrimination in the workplace, makes clearer mention of discrimination on the grounds of religion."
"But we do understand how difficult and how complicated the issue will become if we have an extensive ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion, for example in education."
"And how difficult it will be to negotiate the directive with the Member States, where there are diametrically opposed approaches."
"However, we welcome the approach which you have taken, i.e. the fact that Amendments Nos 15 and 29 point out that some people will probably try to interpret discrimination on the grounds of racial origin as discrimination on the grounds of religion and I agree that the directive must be strengthened on this point and that the Member States must also clearly draw the attention of the courts and other competent authorities to this danger when dealing with the issue of the right to take legal action against discrimination."
"I should also like to comment briefly on independent agencies. I agree with some of the ideas for their role which you put forward, especially the need for them to be independent, but we cannot specify how they are to be organised or how they are to operate because that is a question for the Member States themselves."
"The number of amendments which has actually been accepted is very large and I imagine that we agree that we need to examine how these ideas can be incorporated into an amended proposal so that we retain the structure and balance in the text and the proposal has some chance of being approved by the Council, because I think that, for all of us, the best balance is between what we want and what is feasible."
"I should like to refer very briefly to the more basic amendments which we are unable to accept."
"The first concerns your reservations on the exclusion from the draft of a detailed reference to specific services, such as the police or the judicial authorities."
"As the rapporteur rightly pointed out, the directive may only intervene where there is Community jurisdiction."
"This does not apply in the case of judicial assistance in criminal matters and in the case of police cooperation, both of which come within the scope of the Treaty on the European Union."
"We therefore agree with the reference in Amendment No 37 to public bodies in general but cannot agree to the specific reference to the police and judicial authorities."
"A few words now on the huge issue of special problems in the area of immigration policies and asylum policies. The Commission prefers to follow a gradual approach due to the complexity of the issue and, when processing specific legislative measures on admission policies in these two areas, i.e. asylum and immigration, the Commission will evaluate the situation and decide to what extent the inclusion of an ad hoc clause against discrimination would be the most suitable response."
"There are other points, such as public procurement, where the framework prohibits such criteria from creeping in, the issue of statistics, where I acknowledge and support your fear of a shortage of statistics - one of the basic objectives of the action programme is to create databases at European level - and finally, our obligation, as European institutions, to apply the same rules as those which we propose for the Member States."
"The reforms which we are presently endeavouring to implement within the Commission have taken account of the entire framework of this directive."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for allowing me to run over time, but I needed to comment on a whole series of particularly complicated amendments and articles in order to give the House the best possible understanding of the points which can be accepted and, as you can see, they are numerous."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that if we show the joint political will and continue our excellent collaboration, we can make the small vision of Europe' s fundamental commitment on the issue of racism come true."
"Mr President, the report we are debating here is, in my view, an extremely important one, and I would thank the Commissioner for her explanatory comments on the amendments."
"The international community sets great store by the fight against racism and it is also high on the agenda of the Member States, but a great deal still needs to be done in order to protect human rights and fight racism, xenophobia and intolerance."
"It is also becoming increasingly evident that cooperation within the EU is indispensable."
"Certainly within an open, internal market which enjoys the free movement of goods, people and services, further harmonisation with regard to the scope, content and options for enforcement is vitally important."
"It is with pleasure that I compliment Mrs Buitenweg on her report."
"It is an excellent report which deals with the equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial and ethnic origin, in general."
"I would like to point out, however, that women, in particular, are being disproportionately affected by discrimination and, among women as a group, it is especially women and girls who are often doubly discriminated against on the basis of their race and ethnic origin."
"I have another four points I would like to make, Mr President."
"It would be beneficial if organisations or other legal entities which intend to fight discrimination were to have the right to initiate the procedure to promote the observation or application of this directive or to support victims in the procedure."
"I am also of the opinion that it is advisable that each of the Member States should have an independent body, such as we have in the Netherlands, to assess the complaints."
"This body is called the Committee on equal treatment. It is an independent body which works extremely well and efficiently."
"I am pleased with the amendment tabled by the PPE-DE delegate, Mrs Smet, who advocates that the directive should also apply to elections of employees' representatives in works councils, for example."
"This would be a gain, in my view."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words on the already mentioned problem of sharing the burden of proof."
"This is popularly termed the reversal of the burden of proof in the case of possible discrimination and already applies with regard to women."
"The same system is now also being proposed with regard to this directive."
"In order to actually tackle discrimination head on, it is extremely important - if not imperative - that this shared burden of proof enter into force."
"As the Commissioner said, in practice, this has never led to any difficulties in other spheres before."
"All the more reason to accept a swift implementation here."
"- (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, without doubt, the extremely important ""historic directive"" , as you called it, and the corresponding European Parliament proposals have come at the right time."
"And on time!"
"The need to combat discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin or religious conviction is taking on a sense of urgency on the continent of Europe."
"The revival of fanaticism and Mediaeval attitudes, the emergence of parties based on racial perceptions and the increase in violence bear witness to the fact that respect for others who are different, which is a feature of advanced societies, has not yet been fully achieved."
"Clearly, in the 21st century, ideological and political convictions will meet somewhere between the progressive, cosmopolitan perception which accepts a multicultural society, and fundamentalism, which approaches those who are different with fear and enmity and promotes racism and xenophobia."
"This is why the European Union needs to be given legal armour and to speed up the procedures to complete a common area of freedom, security and justice for everyone living on the territory of the European Union."
"Once the directive has been adopted by the Council, we hope that the Member States will quickly give immediate priority: first, to judicial cooperation and harmonisation of their criminal legislation; secondly, to instructing state agencies and employers on how to apply the directive to all natural and legal persons; thirdly, to applying the 1997 Charter of the European Political Parties on the defence of fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of racial violence; fourthly, to the right of individual victims of discrimination to take collective action; fifthly, to guaranteeing the access of minorities to vocational training, employment, health services and national insurance and pension schemes and their participation in economic, social, political and cultural life."
"We still need public awareness campaigns on direct and indirect discrimination, to monitor the application of the Community institutional framework and to formulate our immigration policy on the basis of the principles which govern this extremely important directive."
"This is the first directive that we are debating under Article 13 and it is a very good start in our fight against all discrimination across the EU."
"MEPs and NGOs worked very hard to get Article 13 into the Treaty."
"I look forward to seeing further directives, perhaps starting with disability."
"Initially, I was against racism being taken separately."
"I would have liked to see it taken with the directive on employment and with the Action Programme."
"I was persuaded of the urgency, because of the current rise of racism across the EU."
"A number of Members have cited individual cases today."
"I hope the Portuguese Presidency can work very hard to push this through and make sure that we do get this racism legislation."
"We have to send the message that we are opposed to racism and xenophobia across the EU."
"I am glad for that reason that we are having the vote today."
"May I turn specifically to some of the amendments."
"I am very well aware that some European jargon excludes people."
"This is the reason I wanted Amendment No 48 on simple language to go in. Amendment No 43: people have talked already about the burden of proof."
"This is working towards a shared burden of proof."
"The plaintiff does have to provide facts and it has already been said that equal opportunities for men and women cover this in European legislation as well."
"Amendment No 51: I am delighted that charities and non-governmental organisations are going to be consulted."
"They are at the sharp end; they know what they are talking about."
"Finally, I would like to add my congratulations to Mrs Buitenweg and to Mr Howitt in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for working so closely together to put forward an excellent report."
"Mr President, since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Justice and Home Affairs Summit, things have really got moving in Europe."
"It is very pleasing to see this."
"The action programme against discrimination, the Commission' s two proposals for directives, the opening of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, and lastly the adoption of Article 13 of the Treaty all give an irrevocable signal."
"There was no anti-discrimination provision of this kind in the treaties before."
"The European institutions can now, on the basis of Article 13, take appropriate steps to fight certain kinds of discrimination."
"The European Parliament has also made its own contribution."
"My colleague, Mrs Buitenweg, has, under considerable time pressure, prepared a well considered report on this anti-discrimination package on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and we are now voting on that report."
"In general, Mrs Buitenweg' s 55 or so amendments make the Commission proposal much more substantial."
"She has achieved a great deal."
"The proposal before us is the first implementation of Article 13."
"It concerns equal treatment irrespective of the colour of people' s skin or their ethnic origin."
"It does not only tackle the most important areas of life, such as access to employment and equal treatment at the workplace, education, social protection and social security."
"The Commission is also attempting to build on experience gained in the Member States."
"The reversal of the burden of proof will make the directive a very important instrument."
"The defendant will now have to provide convincing proof that there is no discrimination."
"The scope of the directive has also been widened, with protection against discrimination being extended to associations and groups of persons."
"A large majority of the committee went along with the rapporteur, and the vote today allows us to take that decision further in a consistent way."
"I would like to expressly thank Mrs Buitenweg for her excellent work and I assume that we will adopt this report by a clear majority today, even if the Commissioner responsible has let it be known here today that she cannot accept half the amendments."
"Nevertheless, a very important step is being taken today and we are giving a signal."
"The previous speaker' s intervention was not translated properly because it was delivered too quickly, so I would ask future speakers to speak more slowly so that the interpreters can keep up."
"Yes, I asked Mr Sylla to slow down."
"But he is free to accept or reject my advice."
"However, you are right: the consequences are that what he is saying is not heard in the other languages."
"Mr President, I wish to make three points."
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the draftspeople and the Commission - in particular Commissioner Diamantopoulou - on the directive and the report we have in front of us."
"It has been a long time coming."
"I was the chairman of the European Parliament' s Committee of Inquiry into the growth of racism and fascism in Europe back in 1986, when our rapporteur, Mr Evregenis, proposed such legislation."
"I myself was the rapporteur for the Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Xenophobia in 1990 that reiterated that demand."
"I suppose in a way it was worth waiting."
"We have here legislation that will make a real impact on the lives of the 12 to 14 million third country nationals living in the European Union and the 4 million black Europeans."
"Secondly, and without subtracting an iota from my support for the report and the directive as a whole, the Council will have to resolve a number of outstanding issues: on representative actions, on the definition of indirect discrimination and, as the previous speaker said, on the burden of proof."
"The last of these must be workable, because otherwise we will keep the previous speaker happy!"
"The best basis is the existing burden-of-proof legislation, which is now underpinned by 25 years of case-law, and where the numbers are not available, expert opinion will suffice."
"Thirdly and finally, I wish to warn my colleagues in the PPE Group."
"Many of them - the large majority I believe - have been genuinely concerned that Parliament' s procedures have not given them adequate time to consider the detail."
"Yet a few clearly have darker motives."
"With Mr Haider and Mr Le Pen lurking in the background, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento Sociale Fiamma Tricolore promoting racism and xenophobia, the PPE Group, as a whole, should not be surprised if people conclude that if they continue with their technical objections, then this is a thinly disguised attempt to block these proposals which the vast majority of Europe so much welcomes."
"Those who lie down with dogs get fleas."
"Mr President, the Economist says that we need 13.5 million immigrants by the year 2015 in order to get everything done that needs to be done in Europe."
"The International Herald Tribune says that we shall not succeed in obtaining that level of immigration and recruitment."
"On other continents, there is an awareness of how racism is growing in Europe, and it is precisely because of racism that immigrants are choosing other continents, notably America, instead of Europe."
"We are used to coming out against racism, because we want to combat intolerance and xenophobia."
"Perhaps we must also combat these things for the sake of our own future."
"Those who maintain that they speak for enterprise and for small businesses are speaking against their own better judgement when they do not support the present proposed directive."
"I support most of the amendments, but on one point I am uneasy."
"This is Amendment No 29 in which it is proposed that a difference of treatment on the basis of ethnic origin, which is presented as a difference of treatment on the grounds of religion, conviction or nationality, is to be deemed discrimination."
"I am afraid that this may be self-defeating."
"In Swedish law on measures to combat ethnic discrimination, it is expressly stated that, in using the term ethnic affiliation, the law means that someone belongs to a group of persons of the same race, skin colour, national or ethnic origin or confession."
"There is a danger that what we believe to be an extension of the definition concerned may, in actual fact, be a restriction of it."
"The general interpretation is, in fact, that ethnic affiliation embraces nationality."
"I shall not, therefore, be voting for the present amendment."
"It contradicts what I properly consider to be the case."
"I would like to thank Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Howitt for the work that they have put into this, which has been both a personal as well as a political commitment."
"As others have said, this is an aspirational directive about the sort of Europe we want to create."
"It is directly relevant, for once, to the lives of many people living within the European Union."
"From my constituency of London where a large portion of the population come from minority ethnic groups and where there is a growing number of children of mixed-race relationships, this is an exceedingly important directive."
"It is even more important for those areas where people wrongly feel that there is no need for anti-racist or anti-discrimination legislation, because there are no visibly non-white people, but yet they will still vote for parties which espouse racist or anti-asylum seeker policies, because they are afraid of the unknown and the different."
"I welcome the directive."
"I am pleased Council feels a sense of urgency about it."
"I assume this will be reflected in their willingness to take on board what Parliament is saying."
"We have to acknowledge that in this House we regularly call upon other countries and governments to recognise the rights of ethnic minorities and to practice policies of universal human rights."
"We have to demand the highest standards of ourselves."
"It will not be easy to implement this directive and I am not referring to the votes."
"It requires us to call into question the workings of all our institutions, including longstanding well-respected ones, and our own practices."
"That will not be easy or painless."
"In the UK we are gradually admitting to the institutional racism we practice and starting to examine the core values of our institutions."
"That cannot be done unless the individuals within them examine their own beliefs and actions."
"That is why the amendments about training, monitoring and implementation are so important in this directive."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has become strong and we have learnt how to build bridges over the last 50 years."
"We have paid very great attention to the social dialogue, which means talking with each other, examining problems and understanding each other."
"Social partnership is an ideal model centred on partners who interact with each other and help each other."
"We should also all be concerned about integration, about good neighbourliness."
"We should endeavour to provide incentives and to act as a model."
"I believe that in human society acting as a model is a particularly important characteristic."
"Particularly as an Austrian, I can say that in recent years, with a population of 7 million, we have accepted a million refugees."
"We are therefore the European country that has accepted most refugees per inhabitant."
"We were a kind of life-raft in Europe, and we still are today."
"We fight against extremism on both the left and the right, as well as against violence."
"Austria has the world' s strictest laws against fascism and against nazism."
"We have learnt some lessons from history and we know how to fight these things."
"We are now talking about discrimination."
"First and foremost, I am speaking on behalf of small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"We must make sure that we do not rob companies of working time and jeopardise their success by forcing them to spend more time on statistical form filling."
"When I visit companies I often hear the complaint that there is too much bureaucracy and too many formalities."
"Form filling is, of course, a very inefficient kind of work."
"If, in addition, there are inspections, this also takes time and I believe that the vast majority of companies behave in a proper and decent way, and that relations between employers and employees are generally very good."
"That is why I also believe that cancelling public contracts can also be provocative, and I am returning to the key issue now: reversing the burden of proof will have a knock-on effect if it is implemented."
"It will encourage abuse."
"People will need to protect themselves against such abuse."
"It will be necessary to keep more evidence."
"It will lead to risk limitation, by which I mean surveillance methods, video recordings and tape transcripts."
"Everyone will try to protect themselves as well as possible so that if they are taken to court they can provide evidence."
"I can see great dangers here and we must ensure that they are averted."
"Mr President it is a measure of the effectiveness and importance of this legislation that even in the midst of a comprehensive series of reforms of race relations legislation in my own country, we have a situation where further improvements can be made."
"I was going to make a speech of the normal variety, but having heard some of the responses across the House, I want to change what I was going to say, which is more in sorrow than in anger."
"This House should recognise and change its tone on what it sees as Article 13."
"Of all the speakers, Mrs Diamantopoulou made the very effective point that words can be cheap in the question of anti-racism."
"Posturing is easy."
"Motivations are many and varied."
"My friend, Mr Sylla, and I are concerned about two important things."
"One is that we create a level playing field through Article 13."
"The burden of proof, the ability for organisations to take cases on behalf of individuals who have been harassed or discriminated against - all of these laws do not create an advantage for the majority of society."
"They create the opportunity for people of talent and ability to release their talents and abilities to enrich what we have in Europe to create wealth, to create the culture and diversity of Europe, not to suffer disadvantage for small- and medium-sized enterprises or anyone else."
"We must start talking positively about these proposals mainly because the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency, many who have created this report, many of my colleagues who have worked hard on their opinions, have responded in the way that we have because we understand that this legislation is not about victims, it is about enriching EU countries."
"Many of those EU countries represented in this House do not pick and choose which race-relation legislation they have - they have none, many of them."
"We have some - we can improve ours."
"It is now an opportunity, a symbolic opportunity and an important practical opportunity for this House to make an historic judgement, to vote in full during a presidency which has helped us bring forward a law which I believe will enrich this House and that we, in time, will be very proud of."
"Mr President, it was difficult to follow the previous speaker, who speaks from the heart."
"So do I, for I applaud the fact that the Commission has been so quick in getting this proposal on the table and implementing Article 13."
"I would also congratulate the rapporteur on a splendid piece of work."
"I am, of course, very much in favour of our arranging for the present directive to be implemented in the Member States as quickly as possible."
"I would especially emphasise four factors which I think are particularly interesting about this directive."
"Firstly, we have obtained a broad scope of application and, secondly, the directive covers both direct and indirect discrimination, including malice."
"At the same time, a shared burden of proof has been proposed."
"We have seen how this is an enormous advantage in connection with sex discrimination, and it is therefore good that it is now being introduced in this area."
"Finally, it is also an advantage that this is a minimum directive, so that the Member States have the opportunity to go still further if they consider it right to do so."
"However, the proposal also suffers, unfortunately, from a fundamental flaw in as much as it relates only to discrimination arising on the grounds of race and ethnic origin and does not cover the other grounds for discrimination listed in Article 13."
"In this way, the Commission is going to create a hierarchy of grounds for discrimination, a way of proceeding which I think is totally at odds with the wording, meaning and spirit of Article 13."
"It would be interesting if the Commission could explain to us what the motives were for creating this hierarchy of discrimination."
"Mr President, our rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, deserves a huge pat on the back for her excellent report and the skilful manner in which she has led the consultation and negotiations."
"We should, therefore, adopt this report without further delay."
"This directive forms part of a larger package which implements Article 13 of the EC Treaty."
"As others have already mentioned, this Article does not only pertain to combating discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, but also based on other grounds."
"I can understand why the Commission has decided to include the fight against racial discrimination in a separate draft directive."
"I can also see why we are discussing this document expeditiously now and why, hopefully we shall be adopting it later today."
"Far harder to accept is the fact that this draft directive against racial discrimination applies over a broader social range and, in terms of content, comprises stronger legal guarantees and control mechanisms than the second draft directive which is still in the pipeline and which is designed to fight other types of discrimination."
"Together with the time lapse between the discussion of both draft directives, this difference in content entails the risk that there will be a hierarchy of types of discrimination."
"This would give out the wrong political message which would, in particular, have an adverse effect on the fight against discrimination on grounds such as age, handicap and sexual orientation."
"If anything, these so-called more recent factors deserve more, not less, attention."
"I would therefore like to see the Commission and Council pledge their willingness to eliminate this form of discrimination between grounds for discrimination."
"I have even less appreciation for the fact that there is no mention whatsoever of discrimination on the basis of sex throughout the package which the Commission presented in November, as if the fight against this was done and dusted. It was probably for fear of stating the obvious that no such mention was made."
"In fact, there was no such risk."
"Existing European legislation governing the equal treatment of men and women only pertains to the sphere of work and is still lacking in many other areas which, especially if we compare it to the directive which we are discussing today with regard to racial discrimination, need attention as a matter of urgency."
"There is not enough time to list them all here, but I do not have the impression that a lack of knowledge on the part of the Commission concerning this matter is the problem."
"I therefore hope that the Commissioner will pledge that she will start this exercise within the foreseeable future and will present proposals soon, as a result of which the equal treatment of the sexes in and out of the work sphere, but especially outside the work sphere, will be aligned to the directive which we are discussing, and will hopefully be adopting, here today."
"Mr President, we are all opposed to discrimination and violence of all forms."
"However, I do not believe extending EU competence to this area is either necessary or useful to its cause."
"New laws will not change the hearts and minds of the people of Europe."
"What we need is education, time and confidence building in a spirit of cooperation between the various ethnic communities."
"We have in our own group two ethnic Members of the Conservative delegation who are extremely active and proud to be British Conservatives, in spite of what the other groups were saying earlier, and they will be voting against these measures."
"The shift of the burden of proof, as called for by this draft directive, is both frightening and extreme."
"Already in the UK, Mr Straw is planning that in rape cases the accused man will become guilty until proven innocent, on the basis of the testimony of one person - the woman in question."
"This is a very dangerous precedent against all forms of natural justice."
"Of course, we all condemn violent racist crimes and attacks."
"I was not present, but I believe a number of allegations were made and cases cited by other groups earlier in the debate."
"Criminal justice must remain the prerogative of the Member States."
"Unlike previous speakers who have cited such cases, I oppose any erosion of national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice."
"This must remain the prerogative of the Member States who will retain control of their own justice systems."
"The EU has no competence in this area whatsoever."
"The more the word 'racist' is bandied about, the more it will become meaningless, devalued and ignored by the public at large."
"I call on all those with any sense to oppose these measures."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately following the urgencies."
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Sierra Leone"
"The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0432/2000 by Van den Bos, Malmström and Thors, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"B5-0444/2000 by Maes, Lucas, Rod, Schörling and Boumediène-Thiery, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"
"B5-0448/2000 by Sauquillo Pérez del Arco and Schori, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0456/2000 by Van Hecke, Ferrer, Schwaiger and Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0465/2000 by Morgantini, Sjöstedt, Brie and Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group"
"on the situation in Sierra Leone."
"Mr President, let us exercise honesty rather than hypocrisy."
"The European Union, the United States and the United Nations have all displayed considerable concern about the developments in Sierra Leone."
"We are not prepared to make any sacrifices."
"The United States is paralysed by the Somalia syndrome."
"The Union hides behind Washington' s back."
"We Europeans even leave the initiative to the Americans who send Jesse Jackson and let him loose in Freetown like a bull in a china shop."
"The United Nations' intervention has once again turned into a fiasco."
"Only thanks to the United Kingdom were we able to stop the rebels in their tracks and arrest their leader, Sankoh."
"This offers opportunities for a peace deal which far outstrips the laughable one which has been shot to tatters."
"More than anything, we now need a watertight diamond boycott."
"To complain about cruel massacres and mutilations becomes very hypocritical if we ourselves allow the diamond industry to earn a fortune on the back of blood-stained diamonds."
"I would call for at least exercising more honesty when we discuss Africa."
"Mr President, the violation of the Lomé peace agreement by the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone is not only a human tragedy for the civilian populations, especially for children, but is also a political tragedy for the whole international community."
"The impunity enjoyed by the rebels in Sierra Leone and the weakness of the peace-keeping forces, who can neither leave the country, for political and humanitarian reasons, nor effectively confront the armed rebels, are a threat to any future United Nations peace mission."
"At the same time, this would be the third failure, after Somalia and Angola, of the Blue Helmets and the United Nations in Africa."
"Africa, where the cruellest conflicts are taking place, is also, as far as peace is concerned, a forgotten territory."
"The mandate of the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone is, by any reckoning, insufficient to achieve its objectives."
"Its reinforcement, requested by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, depends on a decision by the Security Council, the same Security Council which gave the Blue Helmets the resources they required in East Timor and Bosnia, but which is much more reluctant to do the same in Sierra Leone at the moment."
"The United States and Great Britain have only sent forces to the United Nations mission in order to guarantee the safety of the evacuation."
"The only solution to the difficulties of the United Nations mission, in terms of achieving compliance with the peace agreement, is to entrust the political negotiation to the leaders of Liberia and Libya, whose record in seeking peace is very doubtful and also very worrying."
"The liberation of some of the hostages and the arrest yesterday of Sankoh do not put an end to this conflict, but rather they may be a cause for even greater concern."
"Only clear and decisive action by the international community as a whole can put an end to it: the arms embargo; the control of diamond trafficking; the deployment of a rapid intervention force, under the mandate of the United Nations; and the prosecution of the perpetrators of crimes against humanity, the savage attacks against civilians, against international peace and security as well as against the United Nations forces."
"The European Union must therefore support all these types of measures, within the framework of the CFSP."
"Mr President, during the Sierra Leone debate in December, I, together with a few other delegates, warned against the risks involving the Lomé peace agreement."
"This agreement not only lets the leader of one of the world' s cruellest terrorist movements off the hook but, to cap it all, also rewards him with the vice-presidency and authority over the diamond mines."
"But even that was evidently not enough for the rebel leader Sankoh."
"He turned the disarmament pledge into a farce."
"Murder, mutilation, abduction and rape simply continued as before."
"His strategy is very much akin to that of his godfather, Charles Taylor, in neighbouring Liberia, who, by means of terror, forces the population to vote for him in the forthcoming presidential elections and establishes a new Mafia state in the heart of Africa' s diamond industry."
"The UN peacekeeping force, mainly comprising ill-trained third-world troops, is in danger of heading for a fiasco similar to those back in Somalia, Rwanda and Srebrenica."
"Sierra Leone has made it clear once more that it urgently needs a permanent, international peacekeeping force which is well trained and equipped, and led by top commanders from the world' s best armies."
"It is a good sign that the rebel leader was arrested yesterday and that more than 200 UN peacekeeping troops were released over the past couple of days."
"But the question remains of how the rebels will react to this and how the peace agreement will take shape in future."
"In any event, the arms embargo must be supervised more effectively and perpetrators must be brought to justice."
"More than anything, however, an embargo should be imposed on diamonds smuggled illegally from the country, estimated at USD 60 million annually, which is what is at stake for the rebels in their warfare."
"I will call for a ban on these precious stones, which are stained with blood from thousands of innocent citizens, in my own country, Belgium."
"Mr President, we are appalled at the present situation in Sierra Leone."
"There is a dangerous trend towards the escalation of armed conflict, especially as the United Kingdom has now become militarily involved outside international law and the United Nations."
"We demand an end to this military escalation and the immediate resumption of negotiations."
"One-sided recriminations are neither appropriate nor helpful in this situation."
"The RUF is known for its extreme brutality, but we should not overlook the fact that the government and the militias associated with it are little better."
"We demand that the sources of the conflict should finally be tackled, by which we mean stopping the arms trade, halting the RUF' s diamond trade via Liberia and Burkina Faso, and ending the interference of states that want to secure national objectives in Sierra Leone under the guise of humanitarian action."
"I have the feeling that, economically speaking, the United Kingdom is acting in a neo-colonial way and that in political and military terms it is now acting like a colonial power."
"It is very easy to get drawn into a war, but it becomes almost impossible to avoid the next logical step, military intervention, once the atmosphere escalates."
"The military imposition of peace by international troops working with government militias against the RUF will not bring peace at all."
"Quite the contrary, it brings with it the risk of uncontrollable escalation."
"It is high time that the causes of this situation were addressed and a political solution was found."
"Because of this, we need de-escalation in Freetown, not escalation."
"Mr President, given the threats once again faced by the people of Sierra Leone, when they still have vivid memories of the horror and barbarity they have suffered at the hands of the RUF, we cannot content ourselves with simply condemning the events which are recurring."
"Let us remember that amongst the objectives of the common foreign policy are the maintenance of peace and the respect for human rights, principles which are being totally disregarded today in Sierra Leone."
"This Parliament must therefore urge the Member States to support the call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations so that the deployment of a rapid intervention force may proceed in order to re-establish stability in Sierra Leone and thereby contribute to preventing the danger of a new civil war which today hangs over that country."
"However, our commitment must not end with this call."
"We must also fight for an end to the impunity with which acts of genocide and war crimes have been carried out and for the people responsible for them to be brought before the Tribunals so that they may be judged."
"We must also eradicate the cancer which has given rise to the destabilisation of that country."
"That is why this Parliament must urge the OAU, the European Union, the Commission and the Government of Sierra Leone to adopt and promote whatever measures are necessary to end diamond trafficking and the control of that country' s abundant natural resources by those people who, thanks to diamonds, have become men of war."
"We are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Schuman declaration."
"The best tribute we could pay to those people who, through that declaration, sowed the seed which has borne such abundant fruit in terms of peace and well-being, would be to commit ourselves to the cause of that beleaguered country, to decisively help the people of Sierra Leone to re-establish peace and, through peace, the full respect for human rights and the possibility of economic development which will lead it out of poverty and allow it finally to live in dignity."
"Mr President, the fragmented society in Sierra Leone, the child soldiers and the fights between warlords make it extremely difficult to do anything of any consequence."
"We stand here in moral indignation and are, at the same time, filled with a huge sense of powerlessness."
"Politically speaking, in Europe, Mr Chris Patten and Mr Solana are two people from the European Union whom, in the event of foreign security conflicts, we can call on to use their political resourcefulness to both intervene in the region and to support the UN."
"With everything which has been said about diamond trafficking and the halting of other dealings which finance the local war, and with everything which has been said about the need to intervene, what we need at the end of the day is a political solution."
"As Mr Solana occasionally visits the Philippines and Mr Patten is actively involved in the Balkans, I would like to ask them both, on behalf of all of us, to jointly commit their efforts once more, focusing on political support, to reach an active final agreement there with the local regional authorities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, any woman or man who, at any time in the course of the last few months, has bought any diamonds must have felt concerned that these might have come from Sierra Leone or Angola and must have wondered whether, in buying them, they had financed the mutilation of children or the drugging of child soldiers or had supported the abduction of the latter from UNICEF' s rehabilitation camps."
"We can condemn and we can make demands, but what we need to do, and can do, as a Parliament, is to come up with new ideas."
"As was said earlier, we need a long-term strategy for Africa but also a Schuman-style plan for the joint management of those of Africa' s resources which are being fought over, for example in Sierra Leone or in the Congo, so that the struggle does not lead to conflicts with fundamentally undemocratic warlords."
"What do we now have to learn, fifty years after 9 May 1950, that is to say fifty years after the Schuman Plan?"
"We need an equivalent plan for Africa' s resources, just as we need a movement in opposition to the diamond trade."
"I feel that, from a human point of view, this is much more important than any amount of movements in opposition to the fur trade."
"Mr President, we must not forget that the RUF is a vicious and brutal grouping."
"We should congratulate the British Government on taking effective action in a peace-keeping capacity."
"This is exactly the rapid reaction we are asking for within the European Union."
"I find Mr Markov' s remarks, in particular, slightly bizarre because we constantly need rapid-reaction forces to move in to preserve peace and prevent humanitarian disaster - exactly what has happened here."
"Clearly, we also realise that peace keeping can only be carried out by the operation of effective force."
"That is a lesson we have to learn if we are to have a rapid-reaction force within the European Union."
"The other thing we should learn from this is that the Lomé peace agreement was imposed from outside by outsiders and was totally unworkable."
"We should consider that lesson when we try to impose peace agreements in the future."
"Mr President, once again the drama unfolding in an African country is bringing Parliament face to face with the daily horrors of a bloody conflict and civil war."
"Certain kind souls are already pointing the finger at misgovernance and ethnic causes and indicating the culprits who should be eliminated."
"As with the oil of Congo-Brazzaville, Angola or Nigeria and the mineral resources of Chad, Niger or the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and as in the latter generally or in Angola, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the causes are indeed economic and the fight for control of the diamond-producing areas is the basis and reason for this continuing conflict."
"We are right to condemn the Revolutionary United Front or RUF for unilaterally resuming hostilities and for involving thousands of child-soldiers in the horror."
"However, the Sierra Leone army and its militias should also come in for criticism."
"We are right to condemn the use of diamonds by the RUF for war purposes."
"But what are the economic interests behind the government' s actions?"
"We are right to condemn Liberia and Burkina Faso for their involvement in the arms trade and the recycling of diamonds."
"But who is selling arms to these countries and who is buying the diamonds?"
"We are right to send in a UN Implementation Force and to want to disarm those who are fighting. Yet without proper distribution of the wealth of these countries, as in other African countries, and if we continue to allow mining and oil companies to pillage these countries and to fund the groups controlling these resources, our intervention will once again be in vain as it will not tackle the real causes."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that the Commission very much welcomes the capture in the early hours of the morning of 17 May of the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh."
"We understand he was arrested by the Sierra Leonean police and that he remains in government custody."
"I am sure we all hope that Sankoh will now accelerate the release of the remaining hostages."
"There are apparently about 360 of them."
"We understand that has already commenced, but there is a long way to go."
"Similarly, it is to be hoped that Sankoh will now honour the commitments he entered into last July when he signed the Lomé peace accord and that will allow a long-awaited peace and stability to return to Sierra Leone."
"The Commission has been following closely and with very considerable concern the recent events in Sierra Leone which have derailed implementation of the Lomé peace agreement and called into question the commitment of the RUF towards restoring peace and stability in Sierra Leone."
"That, if anything, is an understatement."
"The European Union has issued two statements condemning the RUF' s violations of the peace agreement and the abductions of UN peace-keeping personnel."
"The statements have both called on the RUF to adhere strictly to their commitments under the Lomé agreement and, in particular, to the disarmament process."
"We remain convinced that the Lomé agreement still offers the best chance for lasting peace in Sierra Leone."
"We will continue to support the legitimate government' s attempts to restore peace and stability to the country and to implement programmes of economic and social recovery."
"The recent support provided to the UNAMSIL peace-keeping force by the United Kingdom is welcome - the honourable Member, Mr Titley, made the point well - as is the release last weekend of 139 of the 486 hostages, following the intervention of President Taylor of Liberia."
"The Commission is aware of the reports concerning the involvement of neighbouring countries, in particular Burkina Faso and Liberia, in the smuggling of diamonds and in providing support to the rebels in Sierra Leone."
"The Commission, together with Member States, is currently examining the regional dimension to the conflict with a view to formulating an appropriate regional response."
"The Commission stresses the role to be played by regional organisations, for example ECOWAS, in the prevention of conflicts."
"The Commission is financing with EDF regional funds the ECOWAS conflict-prevention mechanism, which could provide an appropriate channel for dialogue on this question."
"As regards humanitarian assistance, through ECHO we are continuing to finance programmes in support of displaced and refugee communities through international NGOs."
"Since the beginning of 1999, ECHO has provided some EUR 14m of assistance, covering the supply of medical aid, therapeutic feeding, water and sanitation and psychosocial support to children affected by war."
"In addition, this funding has covered support to amputees - the all too many amputees in the country."
"This month the Commission will be seeking approval for a new EUR 12m programme of assistance to Sierra Leone, principally covering refugees and the internally displaced."
"This programme will concentrate on providing support first to refugees in neighbouring Guinea and Liberia, second to internally displaced populations and, thirdly, to women and children affected by the war and, of course, the amputees."
"Ex-combatant children will again receive psychosocial support."
"For me the most interesting point to come out of this debate was not just the expressions of concern about the situation in Sierra Leone - one would expect that - but the number of honourable Members who have expressed very clearly and cogently their views on the diamond trade."
"I say with some feeling that I very much hope that Member States will take account of what has been said in this Chamber."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6 p.m."
"Sri Lanka"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0433/2000 by Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"B5-0449/2000 by Titley and Sakellariou, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0457/2000 by Van Orden and Deva, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0466/2000 by Frahm, Morgantini and Manisco, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0474/2000 by Lambert, McKenna and Lagendijk, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group"
"on Sri Lanka."
"Mr President, the resolution initiated by my colleagues, Mr Van Orden and Mr Deva, concerns a matter that is highly topical and most urgent even though this is the first occasion on which Parliament has devoted time to the tragic conflict in Sri Lanka which has been going on for over 17 years."
"The resolution sends out a powerful message."
"The fighting has to stop."
"The parties have to get round the table and reach a reasonable solution that will last."
"In this regard, it can only be helpful for the international community, whether it is the UN, the Commonwealth or the European Union, to maintain a strong and current interest in developments."
"This legitimate interest should not interfere with the work that has already been carried out by the Indian and Norwegian governments whose representatives have been engaged for some time now in the difficult and sensitive task of brokering negotiations."
"I know that in spite of the dreadful atrocities that have been committed against the civil population and against members of successive administrations, the Sri Lankan government at the highest levels is willing to enter into negotiations and is setting no conditions."
"We must all recognise the overriding importance of maintaining the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka."
"Beyond that there are many political options that can fruitfully be pursued."
"The international community, including the EU, should be ready to provide substantial material support in due course for whatever solution is worked out and to assist the economic and social reconstruction of the country after so many years of conflict."
"Above all, Parliament' s resolution is unequivocal in its condemnation of terrorism."
"This is a scourge which affects us all."
"There is no excuse for the indiscriminate acts of murder and mayhem carried out by the so-called Tamil Tigers against children and ordinary civilians going about their daily business and against democratically elected politicians."
"This is an attack on civilised society and the democratic institutions which we all value so highly."
"Inevitably, the people most effected and most helpless in these situations are the nationals of the target country who have fled the conflict and are trying to lead new lives in Europe."
"These people are most vulnerable to threats and intimidation from organisations acting on behalf of terrorists such as the Tamil Tigers."
"Of course, there are many other terrorist groups whose activities are sustained in a similar way."
"They cleverly avoid breaking the laws of the host country and so can continue their ghastly activities with impunity."
"This situation must change."
"I commend the resolution on Sri Lanka to this House."
"The issue of the place of the Tamils in Sri Lanka is a long-standing problem dating back to at least the year of independence in 1948."
"We have had agreements since then to grant autonomy to the Northeast Tamil region, which have been abrogated by the government."
"In this conflict, far too many people have died."
"There has been a growing catalogue of violence and human rights abuses on both sides - by the Tamil Tigers and, sadly, the government security forces."
"These are well documented by organisations such as Amnesty and the US Department of State in its 1999 Country Report."
"Young Tamil men in particular can find themselves being a victim of violent coercion by the Tamil Tigers and violent interrogation by the security services."
"It is clear that thousands of people have been displaced within Sri Lanka."
"Thousands more have sought asylum and the whole population lives in fear of violence."
"We cannot say what the exact state of affairs is at the moment as there is a complete media blackout in force as part of a set of new restrictive laws introduced in May."
"The resolution is clear."
"Those laws must be lifted before the elections in August."
"Something has to change."
"We have to do what we can to work for a peaceful and lasting settlement."
"It is clear that the international community is no longer prepared to see internal armed struggle as only a problem for the state concerned and that long-term political investment and negotiations are necessary rather than arms sales."
"Northern Ireland is a clear example of the difficulties of such a process, but also the possibilities."
"This resolution is important in its call for immediate cessation of hostilities and the lack of preconditions is a welcome move."
"The situation would also be helped by agreement between the Sri Lankan political parties themselves and we welcome the efforts of the Norwegian and other governments and feel that the Commonwealth could have a very valuable role to play in this situation."
"Mr President, this is an historic day and an historic debate because, after 17 years of war in Sri Lanka, the European Parliament for the first time is actually debating how to bring peace to this war-torn island."
"In 1948, when Sri Lanka obtained independence, it was one of the most prosperous countries in South Asia."
"In 1952, Lee Kuan Yew, the newly elected Prime Minister of Singapore, said: ""My ambition is to make Singapore emulate Sri Lanka in prosperity, education and standard of living"" ."
"Forty-eight years later, that beautiful island of Sri Lanka has been smashed by a terrorist group now recognised as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world."
"There are four million Tamils in Sri Lanka and there are 15 million Sinhalese."
"One million Tamils live in the north; the other three million live in peace in the south with the Sinhalese."
"They hold high office in Colombo, the present foreign minister is Tamil, the country' s leading businessmen are Tamil, so are judges, doctors, lawyers and cabinet ministers - the list goes on."
"Yet this pointless war also carries on, to serve the single purpose of a terrorist leader pursuing his own ambition."
"The resolution states how many people he has killed."
"The LTTE has to be stopped."
"I ask Member States to proscribe this terrorist organisation and to help build peace and stability in Sri Lanka and strongly support the initiative currently being taken by the Norwegian and Indian governments."
"Mr President, here we are again witnessing a conflict between two diametrically opposed parties."
"True, this is the first time we have tackled this issue, but we see similar cases every day."
"Of course, we hope that peace will be preserved and that these issues will be resolved through negotiation rather than force."
"However, we must not forget that the fundamental principle of self-determination is all too often disregarded, sacrificed on the altar of another, equally valid but opposite principle, that of the territorial integrity of the States."
"At this point, a choice must be made between the two solutions."
"I would not presume to say which solution is better but we must find the courage to consider all sides of the issue."
"One of the Members referred to the case of the State of Singapore."
"Singapore used to be part of Malaysia but it is now an independent State."
"The division took place without conflict, and, today, Singapore is no longer part of Malaysia but has its own complete territorial and State independence. This was achieved without conflict, without murder, without torture and without acts of violence."
"On the other hand, in the same geographical area, we have also witnessed another conflict, the conflict of East Timor and, with far too great a delay, Parliament declared itself in favour of the independence of the eastern part of the Island of Timor."
"There it is. At times, I find it difficult to understand how the same people, the same Members of Parliament, are able to adopt different positions on situations which are, if not identical, at least similar in some respects."
"The Island of Timor has been split into two parts and there are now two separate states, thanks to a referendum which was carried out democratically, although not in the best of conditions."
"The people decided their future and, although this involved fighting, conflict and so forth, succeeded in obtaining what they wanted."
"I wonder why this Parliament does not call upon Sri Lanka to hold a referendum as well, along the lines of the referendum held in East Timor, and to abide by the result."
"Mr President, I yield to no one in my desire for peace in Sir Lanka and in my condemnation of all violence."
"However, I say to Mrs Foster and Mr Heaton-Harris that they want to check their stories and sources because it needs both sides in a conflict to be committed if a lasting solution is to be achieved."
"I know Sri Lanka, I have been there."
"I can give you examples of what I have seen."
"I have seen Tamil men being harassed on the streets by government troops."
"I know that Tamil people need 11 pages of documents just to travel from Batticaloa in the east to the capital, Colombo."
"And like everyone here in this Parliament, and all European journalists, I have been unable to go to Jaffna recently, nor have I seen any television coverage of the battle at Elephant Pass."
"I have seen the fighting in Sierra Leone, Chechnya, Kosovo but nothing from Sri Lanka because the Sri Lankan Government does not allow press coverage."
"That goes back longer than last May."
"This is a government whose defence budget has risen by 11% in a year and which, one day, will have to answer allegations of involvement in the assassination of leading Tamil figures and other human rights abuses."
"Let us have a peace for all Sri Lankans, based on citizens' rights, humanity and in which government resources are directed at building communities, not helping to destroy them."
"Mr President, the Commission is as concerned as honourable Members about the tragic and dramatic civil war which has been continuing for the past 17 years, a civil war which seriously affects the whole population of Sri Lanka."
"It is salutary to recall that over 60 000 people have been killed during the course of this conflict - people in both ethnic groups."
"We appreciate the efforts being made in Sri Lanka to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict but we also reiterate, as I am sure all honourable Members would, our concerns for the respect of the basic rules of international humanitarian law."
"The Commission shares the concerns of the European Parliament regarding the latest developments in and around Jaffna."
"On 15 May, the presidency issued a declaration on Sri Lanka."
"This called on both parties, firstly, to cease hostilities and to begin negotiations; secondly, to ensure the safety of the civilian population and, thirdly, to cooperate with the Norwegian government in its endeavours to facilitate a negotiated settlement of the conflict."
"I should like to say in passing that I would like to express my own appreciation of the role played by the Norwegian government, which regularly reminds us by its behaviour on the international stage what we are all missing in the European Union on account of the Norwegian people' s referendum decision."
"The presidency declaration also rightly called on the government to lift as soon as possible the restrictions on civil liberties and press freedom, which have been introduced under the emergency regulations."
"As for our support for rehabilitation in the north and east of the island, a viable political solution has to be found and a measure of peace established before we could consider a major role in this process."
"That is fairly clear and understandable."
"Assistance in favour of refugees and internally displaced persons will continue naturally to be given through the UNHCR and non-governmental organisations."
"The European Commission will continue to provide emergency humanitarian aid to populations affected by the conflict."
"Through our delegation in Colombo, we are following closely the impact of the situation on the civilian population and we are in permanent contact with the ICRC, the UNHCR and the main NGOs."
"I last visited Sri Lanka in the late 1980s."
"I flew into Jaffna - I think I was the first minister from anywhere to do so - in the back of an Indian helicopter gunship."
"Alas, 12, 13 years later, the violence continues."
"It has been a terrible blight on one of the most beautiful countries in the world, with some of the most talented people."
"We are reminded of Sri Lanka' s potential, which we heard about earlier, through the occasionally accurate words of senior minister Lee Kuan Yew."
"That is a reminder of what has been missed in Sri Lanka as a result of this violence."
"We all hope that it ends very soon."
"If we can contribute to the work being done by the Norwegian and Indian governments to help bring the parties together, we would be happy to do so."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6 p.m."

"Philippines"
"Mr President, Commissioner, the crisis in the Philippines we are discussing is a tragedy."
"I represent one of the countries which has citizens as hostages there."
"We appeal to the European Commission to ensure that its representatives continue actively to urge President Estrada to refrain from any assaults which might put the hostages' lives at risk."
"I also sincerely hope that the hostages will be able to benefit from any medical aid, for example, that Médecins Sans Frontières might be allowed access so that we may thereby protect the lives of those who are currently hostages."
"There is, nonetheless, something to be learned from all tragic events."
"I also believe that the Finnish people have learned that the basis for the present conflict is social injustice and that, far apart from one another though we may be, we are nonetheless affected by precisely such social injustices and violations of human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we must be very careful as Europeans about taking issue with separatist movements of the kind being discussed here."
"I say that because many of the borders involved in these great island kingdoms - the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia - are purely and simply colonial borders that we drew artificially to suit our own political and economic interests and which destroyed historical structures."
"To that extent, we are responsible for many of the conflicts in this region."
"That does not mean that it is not up to us Europeans to ensure that these structures do not disintegrate, with all the dangers that would imply."
"We should not put ourselves on a pedestal."
"We have to recognise that we bear a lot of the responsibility for these developments."
"Nevertheless, it is, of course, our task to create peace and stability in this area, and in particular to take action against all those criminals who, on a political pretext, have, in the most appalling way, kidnapped and maltreated innocent tourists who are citizens of the European Union."
"There can be no political justification for ill-treating people as is happening there."
"We therefore appeal to these criminals to release these citizens of the European Union and all the hostages immediately, and we give our full support to Mr Solana and everyone else trying to help to bring this hostage crisis to an end."
"We should also take this hostage crisis as a warning to us to stop ignoring these parts of the world or simply pursuing our own economic interests there."
"Instead, we should be helping to create stable and peaceful conditions there, because these areas of conflict are like open wounds that we ourselves have often inflicted in the past in these regions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our thoughts are with our fellow citizens who simply wanted to discover another culture and who are now being held hostage by the armed group, Abu Sayyaf."
"It is not clear whether this is a case of organised crime or political demands but the island of Jolo is now at the centre of the hostilities with this awful hostage taking."
"In these islands, which are characterised by tropical luxuriance and unspeakable poverty, the machine gunning of villages, kidnappings, ransom demands and torture are common currency."
"This hostage taking and the many violations of human rights show how these armed opposition movements have sunk into criminal excess."
"Although we cannot tolerate these constant violations of human rights, we also deplore the failure of the peace talks with the Philippine Government."
"We also know that the violence has its roots in poverty."
"This is why we strongly support the appeal made by the Archbishop of Manila to President Estrada that socio-economic reforms should be implemented."
"Without the political will to end the situation, the violence can only continue."
"Equatorial Guinea"
"Mr President, we are currently discussing an issue which Parliament has dealt with on previous occasions."
"It is the case of Equatorial Guinea, one of so many African countries which have undergone a very poor transition from the colonial era, during which former colonial relationships, on the one hand, and the ambitions of other Member States of the Union to extend their area of influence, on the other, have prevented the support necessary and conducive to the establishment of a genuine democratic system."
"In 1999 there were general elections to the Guinean Parliament, during which the international observers noted that human rights, democratic guarantees and freedom of information had been violated."
"The same situation may now reoccur during the elections on 28 May, which is why, as this resolution states, we demand the appropriate intervention of the European Union, in order to guarantee that democratic elections take place on this occasion."
"Mr President, the reason for this resolution has already been explained: in Equatorial Guinea, the political and social situation is still extremely serious."
"Firstly, no steps have been taken to establish a constitutional state based on a multi-party democracy which fully respects human rights."
"Secondly, the population endures harsh conditions of poverty."
"The government of President Teodoro Obiang has failed to comply with each and every promise of democratisation which it made to the international community."
"The leaders and activists of the opposition parties face constant persecution, in the form of arbitrary arrest and sometimes torture."
"Of course, they have no access to the media and they have to face corrupt electoral processes, in which transparency and fair play are totally absent."
"With regard to the municipal elections of 28 May, there are grounds for concern, because to date there has been no guarantee of any democratic conditions for these elections."
"We are therefore concerned and we ask that efforts be made to observe how the elections are carried out."
"Guinea is sinking further and further into under-development."
"Paradoxically, its income, which comes from oil, is increasing, but none of it reaches the inhabitants, being entirely purloined by the ruling classes."
"Given this situation, as the resolution we have presented indicates, we demand that the government of Equatorial Guinea initiate a genuine transition to democracy, which we believe could begin by making these municipal elections free elections."
"The Union must exert pressure in this respect, and not lower its guard or accept any more false promises from President Obiang."
"Therefore, if the municipal elections take place in the current circumstances, with no form of guarantee, we must not resume any cooperation with Guinea, apart from purely humanitarian cooperation."
"Article 5 of the Lomé Convention obliges the Union and the Member States to demand democracy and human rights in Equatorial Guinea."
"We therefore believe that this House should follow that line."
"Mr President, the calling of municipal elections by President Obiang should constitute a step forward on the path to democratisation in that country and, therefore, we should take a positive of view of it."
"Even more so if we bear in mind that the President of Guinea is one of the signatories of the Cairo declaration and the action plan which accompanies it, which recognises the need to consolidate democratic principles, based on the right of all citizens to choose their leaders freely by means of free elections and, consequently, also the need to ensure that elections are transparent and free, and to adopt the necessary means for their effective observation."
"However, the experience of previous elections, during which serious irregularities and a total lack of transparency were noted, as well the continuing lack of democratic guarantees in Guinea, requires not only that we observe very carefully how the coming elections are held, but also that we demand, forcefully, that President Obiang adopts the necessary measures to guarantee fair play in these elections."
"We especially have to ensure that the process is open to all political forces - which involves the liberation of the political prisoners - and that the opposition is guaranteed the full expression of its democratic freedoms."
"We should also demand the presence of observers who can monitor, in total freedom, the handling of these elections, and verify that democratic rights have been respected."
"These elections may offer Guinea the opportunity to start along the path to democracy."
"They could also lead to a rapprochement with the European Union and the granting of the aid which the European Union was prepared to give in the event that democracy was respected."
"Therefore, as a Parliament, we have the obligation to exert pressure on President Obiang and demand that he allows these elections to be held in accordance with democratic principles."
"This is the only way that freedom may be fully restored to the people of Guinea."
"Mr President, we cannot and must not miss this opportunity to encourage the people of Guinea to take the democratic path or the opportunity it represents for its youth, since, in an environment of increasing poverty and inequality, the failure of democracy leads to a spiral of violence and repression, which in turn ends in an armed conflict which is often promoted from outside."
"The European Union must, through all possible channels, demand that the Government of Equatorial Guinea free all political prisoners and end the coercion suffered by the democratic forces, in order to guarantee that the coming municipal elections bring hope to the people of Guinea and lead to fruitful relations between Guinea and the European Union."
"Iran (press code)"
"The struggle in Iran for reform and freedom is of great interest."
"There have been considerable reasons for optimism in the election of President Khatami and the overwhelming vote for reformist candidates in the February elections but, as Human Rights Watch notes, the struggle to control the press is, in many ways, the struggle to control the future direction of the Islamic Republic as a whole."
"The very success of the reformist agenda seems to have provoked a backlash by the conservative reactionary forces and an attempt to punish the majority who voted in February for reform."
"They are targeting the independent press because it is a major channel for reformists."
"These attempts surely cannot succeed in the long run because the youthful population is impatient for change showing that Islam and guarantees of rights and freedoms are perfectly compatible."
"We must do all in our power to encourage and support reform, including especially basic legal safeguards for freedom of expression as required by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Iran is a signatory."
"In the meantime, we call on Iran to cease the persecution and prosecution of journalists and writers for views which do not threaten public order, or national security, but only the vested interests of conservatives."
"Mr President, 'Bahar' or 'The Spring' is the name of a new independent newspaper in the Islamic Republic of Iran which we hope is still being published."
"The name 'Bahar' clearly refers to a political programme and undeniably supports President Khatami' s reform policy."
"This course probably coincides rather well with the pursuit of a civil society."
"Iranian conservative circles saw this trend as a deliberate attempt to secularise their own state - and with good reason."
"To their growing dismay, these fervent defenders of the political status-quo within the Islamic Republic have been pushed onto the defensive since President Khatami took office in 1998."
"This was underlined by a painful defeat in the parliamentary elections only a few months ago."
"In order to turn the political tide, the hard liners in Tehran have not shrunk from using any means available to them."
"Just cast your mind back to some eighteen months ago, when a number of independent clergy were killed in macabre circumstances, or to last year, when the student protest was ruthlessly repressed."
"Incidentally, the followers of the revolution leader, Khamenei, attempted to systematically silence the independent and critical press by issuing publication bans."
"This hit the ultra-conservatives during the parliamentary elections particularly hard."
"Hence, their furious reaction last month when they closed all but a paltry three of the reform-minded daily newspapers."
"The present joint resolution supports the persecuted and the journalists in Iran who are doomed to unemployment."
"The latter knew and know that they can count on the support of the large majority of the population."
"Why?"
"Because they were not afraid to publicly turn against a far-reaching lack of freedom in society, which is perpetuated by undisguised terrorist tactics generated by the state machinery."
"With this resolution, the European Parliament aims to encourage Persian editors in their fight for freedom of the press and to banish all fears at the writing desks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this opportunity to talk about Iran again today."
"The reform process in Iran is at risk."
"Even before the newly elected reform parliament has been able to meet, there has been a menacing intensification of the power struggle in Iran."
"We are dismayed at the manipulative reporting of the conference held by the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Berlin, and we are deeply concerned about the arrests of journalists and critical intellectuals in the wake of this conference."
"We are also concerned about the ban on all pro-reform newspapers and magazines published in Iran."
"We call on the Iranian authorities to immediately release the conference participants and journalists who have been arrested, and to cancel all warrants of arrest issued in this connection, to lift the ban on the prohibited newspapers and magazines and, last but by no means least, to respect the political will of the Iranian people, which was so remarkably expressed in the election results."
"We call on the Council, the Member States and the Commission to support these demands on Iran and to make respect for human rights a prerequisite for further cooperation with Iran."
"Mr President, we are currently witnessing massive attacks on the freedom of the press."
"Last week, Mr Putin' s troops occupied the largest opposition publishing house in Russia."
"Yesterday, the same thing happened in Belgrade to the independent radio station there."
"In Iran, we have a situation where newspapers are being banned for simply acting as a voice for those forces and individuals who were so successful in the last election, and who embodied - and continue to embody - hopes of pluralism in Iran."
"I therefore fully support everything Mrs Rühle has said."
"We must take advantage of this phase to offer our firm support to democratic forces and forces for reform in Iran, because what we are witnessing at present is a fresh start and yet simultaneously a setback."
"What is very much at issue here is that we should not allow those forces to be isolated, which is what the regime is working towards."
"That is why it has also been so devastating that the developments at the conference in Berlin occurred, thus giving the regime a pretext for taking measures against the opposition in Iran."
"I am convinced that a dialogue with Iran is, in fact, the only way to influence developments in that country."
"We must not leave the opposition unsupported by adopting measures that encourage isolation. Instead, we should press, through intensive contacts not only with the government but also with the opposition, and by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission bringing all their considerable influence to bear, for an end to these developments, and to ensure that the reform process in Iran, which is fragile but promising, is not once again choked at birth!"
"Burma"
"Mr President, it is an awkward situation, this tenth anniversary of the elections of the NLD in Burma."
"Awkward because the Burmese junta was successful in obtaining international recognition."
"I refer, naturally, to Burma joining the ASEAN."
"It is quite possible that the other ASEAN Member States decided in favour of this with the best of intentions and in the hope that this would kick-start the democratisation process in Burma."
"We have to ascertain, however, that this is not how it worked, that this attempt failed and may well have brought about the opposite effect, judging from the smirks on the faces of the Burmese rulers when they hosted the ASEAN meeting of Ministers for Economic Affairs earlier this month."
"In our opinion, relations between the European Union and ASEAN should not suffer because of the problems within Burma."
"These relations are too important for this."
"It does mean, however, that, if this situation continues, we will need to discuss the situation in Burma in our contacts with ASEAN."
"However, we have to ascertain at the same time that our own sanctions were not that effective either."
"It may be opportune to consider whether we can take so-called intelligent sanctions against Burma."
"After all, sanctions should just focus on the one goal, namely the reinstatement of democracy in Burma."
"Yesterday, we saw the arrest of 95 members of the NLD and the situation in Burma has become untenable."
"One of the key things we need to look at is the role of some European multinational oil companies, in particular the French-Belgium company, Total Fina."
"We also need to criticise the French government for the fact that they are backing this."
"Even the British government is more progressive when it comes to their policy on this."
"The British government has actually called on Premier Oil to withdraw from Burma."
"The French government should follow the example of the British government."
"It is unacceptable that European multinational companies are investing in and backing up a system where large-scale gross violations of human rights are taking place."
"When it comes to sanctions, we really need to answer the call that we should implement economic sanctions against the SPDC and that we should be ending all links between Europe and Burma based on trade, investment and, in particular, tourism."
"It is unacceptable that we should be investing in tourism in a situation where gross human rights violations are taking place, where people' s lives and liberty have basically been denied."
"Mr President, it is now ten years since Burma witnessed a political drama."
"After a period of uncertainty and conflict, open and fair elections were held in 1990 and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was voted President with an overwhelming majority."
"In the parliamentary elections, the NLD won most of the parliamentary seats."
"Shortly after this, the military once again seized power."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned."
"Parliament was dissolved and many MPs were murdered, imprisoned or driven out of the country."
"Since then, Burma has been the scene of unprecedented repression."
"Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands of people have fled the country and are living in camps in Thailand, Malaysia and India."
"In the country itself, entire population groups have been displaced in order to break up the minority groups."
"There is talk of forced labour."
"According to the Financial Times this week, Burma has more child soldiers than anywhere else in the world."
"Burma can be compared with South Africa and Chile in the Eighties."
"What action would we like the Commission and Council to take?"
"First of all, we would ask you not to accept that the military regime in Burma should represent the Burmese people at the Euro-Asian Summit."
"We also ask you to take a hard economic line against Burma."
"We advocate economic isolation and an absolute investment ban by all EU Member States, as proposed several times already by the United States."
"Moreover, EU citizens should be dissuaded by their governments from travelling to Burma for their holidays."
"Many of these new facilities have been built using forced labour."
"This is the core of our request."
"Burma should not receive any better treatment from the international community than South Africa and Chile did back in the Eighties."
"If it does, then we are using double standards."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi should at long last receive an effective response to her peaceful protest."
"What would she otherwise gain from a Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize if she does not actually receive support in order to free herself and her country from this terrible plight?"
"Football: ""Euro 2000"" and preventing hooliganism"
"Mr President, I must declare an interest because I am a Class I soccer referee and very active in that and have been involved in football at many levels for 18 years."
"This resolution looks at the security and safety arrangements ahead of Euro 2000 so that decent football-loving supporters from across Europe can go to, watch and come away from football games this summer without fear or concern for their safety: a fairly apt thing to call for considering the recent events in Copenhagen."
"Most Members will find this motion uncontentious."
"However, I do understand that there are some queries about the question of the suitability of the Charleroi stadium and its ability to safely host the England versus Germany game on 17 June."
"These I will tackle now because I believe these points are what people want to hear about."
"I thank the BBC Watchdog Programme for providing me with details of the findings of a renowned British sports stadia expert, Dr Jim Dickey."
"He found, after just a brief examination of the temporary structure above the north stand in Charleroi, that there were too many seats in the rows, the stand is too steep, the safety barriers are too low, the exits from the stand are too narrow and the stairways at the back of the stand are too wide."
"This stand, like all the others, will be full to capacity on 17 June."
"Meanwhile, a few miles up the road, the King Baudouin stadium, Belgium's national stadium, and now probably one of the safest stadia in all of Europe, will lie empty that day."
"I understand the regional pride of many members from Belgium and I do not question that much time is being spent by the organisers of Euro 2000 looking into the safety and security aspects of the competition."
"But surely, common sense should prevail and the future of this particular fixture at its current venue should be actively re-examined."
"I do hope that Members will support this motion, because this is something we can actually change for the better."
"Why not look at an event beforehand and not worry about the consequences of the bad actions of a few violent people after such a football event."
"Mr President, I hope there will be a great football match on 17 June between England and Germany."
"Most people are looking forward to a good match and hope that it will be safe."
"But, unfortunately, that is not the view of everybody."
"The German police anti-hooligan task force has said that it is pretty confident there will be hooligans there."
"I cannot say anything about German hooligans but I can talk about English football hooligans - I cannot say 'fans' and even the word 'hooligan' is not strong enough for them."
"There is a group of people who very definitely are planning to be there."
"If you doubt me, just look at the press photographs of the problems that occurred in Copenhagen last night."
"As well as the problems my colleague referred to that could occur inside the stadium at Charleroi, there is a serious problem that may occur in the streets around that stadium."
"The head of the Belgian Police Federation has said that he is concerned."
"We are saying now to the Belgian authorities and the European football authorities that they should choose the option of a safer ground that is available elsewhere in Belgium, and the stadium in Brussels has been cited."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after discussing all these terrible events in the world, it is certainly refreshing to consider other problems even though, on reflection, these also involve images which cannot be tolerated."
"I do not believe, however, that the motion before us deals with the problem correctly."
"For example, paragraph 2 of the motion is wrong. In this paragraph Parliament expresses its concern about the fact that the Charleroi stadium, which is to host several games, in particular the England versus Germany match, does not meet the relevant Belgian safety standards."
"This is wrong for several reasons."
"The first is that the organisers of any game in Belgium and the promoters of any stadium must sign a public-law agreement with the municipality in which the stadium is situated. This agreement engages the personal responsibility of the burgomaster."
"Our fellow Member has spoken of regional pride."
"Belgians are aware of the good and bad sides of regional pride and, as a result, the use of a stadium requires not only the signature of the burgomaster but also that of the Minister of the Interior."
"It is therefore completely wrong to talk of regional rivalries."
"Furthermore, everyone knows or should know that it is not the inhabitants of Charleroi who chose this game any more than the others."
"Finally, in the context of Euro 2000, there is an additional requirement that the stadium must be approved by the European Union and UEFA."
"For all the stadiums which have been converted to accommodate an adequate number of visitors, UEFA has not only given its final authorisation to the process but has also been involved in the practical organisation of the stadium reviews."
"I know something about this as I have worked, in my capacity as burgomaster of the town of Liege, on the preparation of a similar stadium."
"To conclude, I regret to say that our colleagues are using arguments which are inaccurate and which can therefore only lead to wrong conclusions."
"I am not the only one to think this as Mr Desama would have said the same if he had been able to speak. Our Dutch colleague, Mr van den Berg, also agrees as he asked me to say that in this case he has witnessed, in addition to a responsible attitude from the Belgians,..."
"... very close cooperation with the Dutch government and it started at the very beginning and we extended this cooperation with France on account of the lessons of the World Cup and a host of other countries, 14, I believe, including the United Kingdom, of course, because we wanted to have contacts with the countries which might send teams to Belgium."
"Mr President, I will conclude by saying that the third and last point is that I think Parliament should make rules and not bother about taking chances."
"Are we going to deal tomorrow or next week with the trains leaving Paddington Station?"
"Mr President, there are a number of advantages to this text."
"Firstly, it gives us the opportunity to reiterate that we all condemn hooliganism and that we all obviously want to fight this phenomenon to the best of our ability."
"I must also point out, however, that, for two years now, in both the Netherlands and Belgium, the sporting, political and police authorities have been preparing in a professional manner for Euro 2000 and, in practical terms, huge investments have been made."
"Despite that, is there still a risk?"
"Of course, but then there is always a risk."
"When faced with such a phenomenon, you can never say that nothing will happen."
"However, I must say very sportingly to our British colleague that this does not justify an event of this type being used from the outset to incite prejudice. It does not justify the attempt to spread incorrect information in official European Parliament documents either."
"Paragraph 2, as indicated by Mr Dehousse, is incorrect."
"The Belgian authorities have given authorisation for the Charleroi stadium to be used."
"Paragraph 3, which indicates that the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels might be used, is wrong."
"No authority and no official has indicated this."
"We must therefore be reasonable and certainly not adopt texts like this."
"Finally, our fellow member has cited information which he was delighted to indicate was given to him by the BBC."
"I should like to mention something which was said on the BBC by someone who is not a football referee like you but who is the coach of the England team."
"What did Mr Keegan say - I am nearly finished, Mr President - during his visit to Charleroi?"
"He said that it is a suitable stadium for a high-level match."
"He even said that this stadium differs very little from a large number of stadia in England."
"So, be sporting!"
"As a referee, Mr Heaton-Harris, you have one viewpoint but I prefer that of Mr Kevin Keegan who seems to me to be better qualified. Therefore, please withdraw your motion."
"Mr President, there is no question in my mind that we all want to see the eradication of hooliganism in football at a European level and globally."
"However, we must be careful not to do so in a manner that would restrict the enjoyment of the real supporters."
"The issue must, therefore, be discussed at a European level, and we should guard against becoming embroiled in local discussions on the capacity and safety of specific stadiums, wherever they might be."
"We must ask ourselves why measures taken in the past have repeatedly failed to create a culture of enjoyment in football for everybody."
"I welcome the dialogue under way now between the Commission and sports and football clubs on how matters could improve."
"The people who run the game are the people who, through constructive dialogue, will eventually be able to find answers to the blight of hooliganism and, it must be said, racism affecting this most popular of all sports."
"Mr President, we must take these issues of hooliganism seriously."
"We know now that there are tens of millions of people who are passionate about this sport and that, since the World Cup was won by France, they have been impatiently awaiting Euro 2000."
"Football has become a sport of the masses and we must think about the safety of our children, our little brothers and the youngsters who frequent the stadiums."
"We cannot therefore just say that there are risks and there will always be risks."
"We must try to counter this phenomenon of hooliganism to the best of our ability."
"I say this because we cannot allow the good image of genuine supporters to be tarnished by the actions of a few violent extremists who use these major gatherings as a pretext for carrying out unacceptable acts."
"The motion is good in that it indicates that adequate safety measures must be taken."
"During the last World Cup you will remember that hooligans committed very serious acts of violence. One in particular involved an attack on a police officer who was in a coma for a long time and who is now paralysed for life."
"All this is not inevitable and we must find the means, for example, of punishing hooligans in the countries of the European Union in which they commit their offences."
"In this respect I believe there to have been a recent example in France which is very important."
"For years, under the Nazi banner, French hooligans monopolised a stand at the Parc des Princes in Paris."
"They took advantage of matches to vent their hatred, chant Nazi slogans and chase blacks and Arabs on leaving the ground."
"The Paris St. Germain club allowed this to happen and even ended up blocking access to the stand in question for any dark skinned person on the pretext of safety."
"Following a complaint from the French association, SOS-Racisme, and faced with the threat of prosecution, the club undertook to end this behaviour and to no longer allow the hooligans into the stadium by strictly screening people as they enter."
"Before every match, right to the end of the season, Paris St. Germain now shows an anti-racist video clip which celebrates the values of friendship and brotherhood and the pleasures of the sport."
"This proves that action can be taken and that violence is not inevitable. I truly believe that, when you think about what football has become, with tens of thousands of youngsters in these stadia, this shows that we really must try to be careful and not take these matters lightly."
"Mr President, the PPE-DE does not support the resolution of the British delegates and has announced that it is to withdraw it later on, not because we would not want to condemn the increasing violence as a result of football matches, but because the resolution is too restrictive and insubstantial as it stands and, to that extent, does not belong in this Chamber."
"Surely it is not up to us to get involved in the politics of one specific match at a specific venue and make technical statements about the suitability of one football stadium for one Euro 2000 match?"
"It would have been much better to point out - and I would like to do so on behalf of many PPE-DE colleagues - that, first of all, safety is an essential good over which extreme care is to be taken and for which many efforts are being made with regard to Euro 2000."
"Secondly, all those responsible for safety at Euro 2000 are called on to operate in an extremely preventive manner."
"Thirdly, the police forces of all participating countries must be encouraged to negotiate obstacles which would hinder extensive collaboration."
"Fourthly, we would like to call on all those involved - organisers, players and supporters - to observe fair play."
"It is unfortunate that this resolution led to a match between Belgium and England, first within the PPE-DE and later on in this Chamber, too."
"I do hope that this match finishes in a sportsmanlike way and I hope that the Belgians will not just win here but also a number of matches during Euro 2000."
"Mr President, hooliganism is not a borderline phenomenon but clearly takes the form of a subculture and is, as such, difficult to control."
"In my opinion, zero tolerance is the only way to systematically tackle any infringement and efficiently penalise any breach."
"The content of the current resolution overlooks the causes of hooliganism, whether or not consciously."
"It is clear that the initiators of the resolution are more concerned with slating the organisation of Euro 2000."
"The Liberals, however, refuse to play this game."
"We can appreciate the enormous efforts which the governments of the organising countries have made in order to make Euro 2000 run as smoothly as possible."
"All we want to do on the eve of Euro 2000 is to call on each and every one who bears responsibility to exercise the greatest possible alertness so as to reach the set goal, namely to turn Euro 2000 into a party for hundreds of thousands of spectators and millions of viewers, a party which should help us project a positive European image."
"Mr President, we are unable to support the submitted resolution."
"I was in favour of discussing the topic of hooliganism but this resolution can at best be described as agenda pollution."
"This Parliament should not be discussing safety during one particular Euro 2000 match under pressure from what I assume is a portion of British public opinion."
"It is also an insult to - in this case - the Belgian organisers of this game and the international authorities involved."
"This is a great pity because extensive discussions can be held about the fight against hooliganism itself."
"In addition, we continue to learn important lessons, such as for example, how we should really guide the fans?"
"How can we better educate club managers and organisers of games? Attention should also be given to the so-called 'second opinion' which is now being applied, by means of which a group outside the organisation analyses the measures taken and suggests improvements."
"Mr President, hooligans have managed to spoil the fun of the real fans too often."
"It will be different at Euro 2000, as this will be a football party for everyone."
"Mr President, I will begin in the Philippines and end, such is the reach and range of the European Parliament, with football."
"The Commission shares the honourable Members' concern for the health and safety of the hostages in Jolo and Basilan."
"We strongly condemn such terrorist actions."
"We were, of course, fully associated with the decision to send the EU High Representative, Javier Solana, to the Philippines."
"Mr Solana was sent to convey personally to the Philippine government the European Union' s message concerning the safety of the hostages."
"He received assurances from the government of the Philippines that military force would not be used to liberate them."
"We are following events in Mindanao and the neighbouring islands closely."
"We are concerned at the escalation of political violence that has taken place after the suspension of the peace negotiations between the government of the Philippines and various armed groups."
"We believe that only an early resumption of peace negotiations, as requested by the leaders of civil society and of religious groups, offers prospects for a lasting improvement of the situation in Mindanao."
"I should wish to add one final point about the 21 hostages - seven of them are European Union citizens."
"Obviously, we all hope for their early release. Our thoughts are, I am sure, with their families."
"I hope, too, that we will receive early news about the welfare of the journalists who went to cover the story and have subsequently gone missing."
"I hope that their whereabouts will soon be discovered."
"Moving on to Equatorial Guinea."
"We have been closely monitoring the human rights situation there for several years. We share the concerns of the European Parliament about the local elections there."
"Those concerns were reflected in the presidency declaration at the beginning of May."
"During a recent mission by the Commission services, the issues that Parliament is addressing were raised directly with the President."
"An official request for an electoral monitoring mission was sent on 2 May by the Equatorial Guinea government to Commissioner Nielson."
"An answer containing detailed reasons for the refusal is being sent by the Commission to President Obiang."
"The request from the government of Guinea-Bissau arrived very late and, in keeping with our guidelines, electoral observation missions should be prepared at an early stage in the electoral process so that we can ensure that the process is accurate and fair."
"It is relevant that the opposition parties in Equatorial Guinea have contested the electoral lists and have already decided to boycott the ballot."
"We therefore consider that, at this stage, the presence of international observers would not only fail to improve the quality and the transparency of the local elections, there is also a very real risk that this mission could be misused by local authorities as a way to legitimise an unsatisfactory process."
"However, we intend to involve ourselves in promoting the process of democratisation in Equatorial Guinea."
"On Iran, the Commission fully shares Parliament' s concern over the lack of freedom of expression there."
"In the comprehensive dialogue between the European Union and Iran, questions regarding human rights, including press freedom, are regularly raised by the Commission."
"The Iranian authorities are well aware of the importance we attach to these issues."
"Clearly the present position is a very delicate one: the opponents of reform have used their control of the judiciary and of the security forces to intimidate intellectuals and to ban reformist papers."
"The current trial of the 13 Jews on charges of espionage is also very disturbing."
"The reformists have remained calm, and so should we, hoping that the convening of parliament will shortly help improve the situation."
"I turn to Burma."
"We deplore the continued violation of human rights by the Burmese military regime."
"In particular, we deplore the continued extra-judicial killings, the widespread imposition of forced labour and the forced displacement of local populations, as well as the repression of political opponents and the prevention of the free functioning of legitimate political parties."
"This includes the restrictions on the freedom of movement of Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the National League for Democracy and the routine practice of arbitrary arrests."
"We have strongly supported the EU common position on Burma and the decision of the April 2000 General Affairs Council to strengthen that common position."
"We use every opportunity to press our Asian partners to urge, what is called - with a touch of George Orwell - the ""State Peace and Development Council"" to enter into a substantial dialogue with the democratically elected representatives and the ethnic minorities with a view to arriving at a mutually agreed internal solution to the problems of Burma and to respect for international human rights standards there."
"Lastly, on football hooliganism: the responsibility for ensuring adequate safety for spectators and players during the Euro 2000 matches lies with the relevant national authorities and the relevant football associations."
"I just wish to make two additional points."
"Firstly, we want Parliament to recall that, last June, the Justice and Home Affairs Council requested Member States to step up cooperation in order to prevent and control violence and disturbances in connection with international football matches."
"At the same time a handbook was made available with examples of working methods to police forces."
"Secondly, the Community' s programme for police and customs cooperation finances a project prepared between the police authorities of the Netherlands and Belgium in which police forces from other Member States participate."
"This aims at drawing lessons from the organisation of Euro 2000 in order to improve, when necessary, the organisations of future similar events."
"I would just like to add one point."
"I very much hope that Euro 2000 is a great success."
"However, I hope with equal fervour that the games during Euro 2000 are a great deal better than the one I watched on television last night."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6 p.m."
"Mr President, on a point of order. I will be very brief but I rise on a matter which is dear to the hearts of most Members here."
"On a number of occasions this week the Members bar has had in it visitors from outside Parliament and, actually, just members of the public."
"I know a number of Members during the week have been unable to get any food."
"Could we have some clarification from the Quaestors so that we can have a Members bar?"
"We have a Members bar in Brussels."
"I am not against taking one or two members of staff or whoever it might be into the bar, but to bring visiting groups of 20 or more into it is wrong."
"I hope we can have some clarification."
"Thank you, Mr Sturdy."
"We will refer that to the College of Quaestors, as you requested."
"Mr President, I understand that we are to vote on the last two resolutions, concerning Guatemala and the non-proliferation agreement, without a debate."
"I am not going to object to that, but I would note the anomaly in Parliament being able to devote half an hour' s discussion to football hooliganism - and I am nonetheless a great football enthusiast - but not having a spare minute to discuss the biggest form of hooliganism we have, namely the presence of nuclear weapons in the world."
"Your point is well made."
"The decision was taken this morning that we would vote at 6 p.m. and that the urgencies not reached would be voted on even though they were not debated."
"The matter of football hooliganism was under the human rights matters."
"That debate has been concluded. So we have finished that whole section."
"I do not want lots of debates."
"We have a lot of voting to get through tonight."
"Mr President, I quite understand that you want to avoid a long debate now, but I do not think it was clear when we decided on this this morning that the urgencieswould simply go by the board."
"If that had been the case, some Members might have voted differently."
"This House should certainly not get into the habit of letting subjects which have been on the agenda since the beginning of the week go by the board."
"We were going to discuss Guatemala."
"MPs from Guatemala have been with us the whole week, and we are trying to convince them to improve their democracy and their respect for human rights."
"I do not think we will be setting a very good example if we then fail to even discuss this issue!"
"I would just point out to you Rule 50, paragraph 6: ""The President and political group chairmen may decide that that the motion for a resolution shall be put to the vote without debate"" ."
"That was the rule under which this practice has been established."
"I agree with you that it should not become a precedent."
"Let us move forward now to the vote."
"Mr President, I rise to make a point about the vote: it would be quite possible to challenge this vote either because of non-observance of the 24-hour deadline, or, possibly, because of the quorum position."
"I do not want to do this, but I would like to ask Mrs Buitenweg and her friends to call a truce tomorrow and to refrain from their sabotage tactics in this House!"
"Mr President, I rise to make a point of order along exactly the same lines as my fellow Member."
"I regret that Mrs Buitenweg has involved herself in sabotage tactics and I would like to respond to the repeated claims we have heard from Mrs Buitenweg, Mrs Van Lancker and Mr Howitt, who are accusing others of sabotage, when, in fact, it has been Mrs Buitenweg herself who has been at the forefront of the action to sabotage the functioning of this Chamber."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I should like to move that we proceed to a vote straight away."
"We had the debate on this this morning, we made our decision, let us just get on with it."
"Vote"
"Mr President, people are different, yet of equal value."
"In our opinion, human society should be based on solidarity, human dignity and equality."
"Everyone is entitled to this."
"Unfortunately, there is a long tradition of unequal treatment, first and foremost by people who have the power to make other people dependent on them."
"They can treat those who are dependent on them unequally by rewarding or punishing them for features which are out of their control."
"This was not only done by slave owners and colonial military, but has also been the tactic of employers and those with political authority."
"There is also discrimination if the basic requirements of people are made unnecessarily scarce."
"If everyone has to fight for a job, a place in education or house, a battle of interests will ensue."
"People then start to think along the lines of: if the others were not here, there would be more for us."
"From a racist angle, the question then simply is: who can have those scarce provisions and who cannot?"
"Anyone belonging to a different group can be seen as an unwanted competitor on the job or housing market."
"In Western Europe, employers and the police are still ruled by prejudice and a tendency to treat people unequally."
"In addition, there are groups who seek political gain from scarcity and short-sightedness by setting people against each other."
"The fact that in the recently formed new states of Eastern Europe, the language of workers and farmers has become the language of the state and education, forms part of the necessary democratisation process but should not go hand in hand with discriminating against, and even driving out, minorities living within the particular state' s territory."
"Everyone is entitled to protection from those seeking political and economic gain from discrimination."
"Vital tools for achieving this are suffrage for newcomers, humane treatment of political refugees, equal treatment of all residents of the European Union, irrespective of their nationality, and the reversal of the burden of proof in legal cases."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has opted in favour of maximum reinforcement of the position of the victims of discrimination and against all attempts to prejudice this protection."
"Mr President, I voted for the proposal for the race directive."
"I did so very willingly and, particularly in my capacity as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I am glad to have been able to use my vote to contribute to the adoption of this directive."
"Today' s pensioners and elderly people lived through the Second World War: they know what racism means."
"They hoped that the issue would never have to be raised again, let alone regulated by laws banning racist acts."
"I hope that this law will soon be out of date, for that will mean that antiracist behaviour has ceased."
"I hope that this and every other law against discrimination will become obsolete."
"Since, sadly, this is not the case at present, Europe is acting wisely in publicly making its position so clear."
"The Commission' s proposal for a directive on implementing in Europe the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin clearly shows that it is better to let well alone. This is even truer with regard to the Buitenweg report to the European Parliament."
"The proposal initially seemed to be well intentioned as it aimed to improve protection for victims of racism in the European Union."
"In reality, however, the text before us is so obsessed with hunting down discrimination that it completely loses sight of the basic principles of the rule of law and even, to crown it all, the principle of equal treatment between persons."
"In addition, the proposal for a directive as usual fails to respect subsidiarity and allow the Member States the necessary room for assessment."
"On the issue of the rule of law, it is particularly astonishing to read in Article 8 of the Commission' s text that if, in a given situation, a case of discrimination is assumed, it is the defendant' s responsibility to prove that there has been no violation of the principle of equal treatment."
"This flouts the traditional principle of our law which states that it is the responsibility of the accuser to provide proof of the culpability of the accused and not the responsibility of the accused to provide proof of his innocence."
"The effect of such a provision would be all the more devastating as the assumed discrimination could be 'indirect discrimination' which occurs, according to Article 2(2)(b), 'where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice is liable to affect adversely a person or a group of persons of a particular racial or ethnic origin' ."
"However, this dedication to anti-discrimination soon comes to a halt in the Commission' s text as Article 5 states that specific measures may be adopted to compensate for the handicaps of a supposedly disadvantaged ethnic group."
"This sows the seed for the famous American policy of 'positive discrimination' which is nowadays much disputed, even in the USA."
"And this is just the Commission' s text which is the most moderate."
"The European Parliament report adds to this in all respects."
"Some people in the Commission seem to be having doubts as they have taken the trouble to add a form to the proposal for a directive which explains the possible impact of the directive on enterprises."
"This unusual procedure clearly shows that the issue is not cut and dried."
"In this form, the Commission simply states that ""the Directive will strengthen the competitiveness of European companies by ensuring that they have at their disposal a wider pool of skills and resources than at present and that use is made of such skills irrespective of racial or ethnic origin"" ."
"Unfortunately, this statement, which is solely intended to give the authors a clear conscience, is completely false."
"It is quite clear that employers risk being plagued, particularly in the area of recruitment, with threats from people whose applications have been rejected."
"Yet it cannot be denied that the immigrants currently entering the European countries are mainly unskilled and come from countries where work experience in businesses such as ours is very scarce."
"Threatened by this new legislation and in order to keep the peace, employers may be forced to employ people without any real justification which will hinder the competitiveness of their companies."
"For all these reasons, we reject the Buitenweg report. We hope that the Council, which must act unanimously pursuant to Article 13 of the EC Treaty, will in turn reject the Commission proposal."
"We have voted for the Buitenweg report which supports and improves, in several respects, the proposal for a Council directive on implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin."
"However, as we said during the vote on Amendment No 39, we totally disagree with the wording of Article 4 of the draft directive. By providing that ""a difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to racial or ethnic origin shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine occupational qualification"" , this totally contradicts the provisions of the international and European conventions on human rights and the elimination of all forms of social discrimination."
"This article cannot be transposed into French law, for example, as the Constitutional Council would rightly be forced to oppose this."
"If retained in the final version of the directive, this article would, for the first time, constitute a legal basis for discrimination in the right to work based on 'a characteristic related to racial or ethnic origin' ."
"We were anxious to accompany our vote with this reservation which also applies to the totally inappropriate use in several articles, in the French version at least, of the word 'race' ."
"In Article 2, for example, it is used to describe 'a group of persons' and not as a characteristic of unacceptable discrimination. This therefore seems to justify this concept and allows it to be validly and properly used to describe a person or group."
"The fight against racism is clearly based precisely on the rejection of the concept of race, on its denunciation and on the refusal to place men and women in this category and to divide humanity according to this concept."
"- I am voting in favour of the Race Directive for the following reasons."
"As a British Asian woman, I have experienced first-hand the damaging effects racism can have on people and communities."
"Although there have been tremendous strides over the last few years to fight racism in all its forms, it still continues to blight people' s lives."
"For example, in my own region, the West Midlands, we have recently seen some worrying instances of racist violence."
"The attack on the white partner of the world-class black athlete Ashia Hansen is a sickening example."
"This report is a real breakthrough in reversing the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases."
"Once the facts of the case are established, it will fall to those accused of racism to prove their innocence."
"I particularly welcome the measures included in the directive which will allow individuals to take civil proceedings if they are victimised on the grounds of race."
"I am also glad that the legislation takes account of the notion of ""indirect discrimination"" , where apparently neutral provisions can have an adverse effect on a person or a group of a particular race or ethnic origin."
"Right-wing extremism is increasing, not just in Austria, but throughout Europe."
"This directive provides some of the most effective anti-racism legislation that Europe has ever seen, and the most effective piece of race relations legislation to affect my own Member State since the 1976 Race Relations Act."
"Minority groups must be given a greater stake in Europe."
"The EU should pay more attention to their problems and aspirations."
"We need to connect EU institutions to all the communities of the Union."
"Europe must be inclusive, not exclusive."
"We must tackle racism wherever and whenever it occurs."
"The race directive is a stand against racism and a major step towards stamping it out."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the report by Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg on the Council' s directive for implementing the principle of equal treatment for all, irrespective of race or ethnic origin."
"We were delighted to do so, because the European Parliament is hereby complying with its task in connection with implementing Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"According to Article 13 of the Treaty, the European Parliament is merely to be heard on this matter."
"In our voting, it has therefore been important that Parliament' s opinion - both the individual points and the opinion as a whole - should have very broad political backing."
"We have nonetheless been unable to vote in favour of those amendments directly affecting matters which come within the sphere of the Member States' criminal law."
"These matters continue to be national concerns."
"In connection with the debate on the report, we have pointed out that the present directive only deals with discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin."
"But what about all the other protective considerations listed in Article 13 of the Treaty?"
"We are concerned that, by only proceeding on the basis of these two considerations in the present directive, the EU will, in practice, create a hierarchy of possible grounds for discrimination."
"We would therefore especially draw attention to Amendment No 6 concerning a new consideration which is absolutely crucial for ourselves."
"- Given the worrying evidence that racism is on the rise I warmly welcome this report which aims to ensure equal treatment in the employment and social sector between persons of all ethnic backgrounds."
"The rapporteur seeks to ensure a common minimum level of protection including the reversal of the burden of proof in civil race discrimination cases and giving individuals the right to take civil proceedings if they are harassed or victimised on the grounds of race."
"The Portuguese Presidency is to be congratulated for their readiness to put this matter on the Council' s agenda."
"The fight against discrimination is an issue which has been on the agenda of the French Assembly since 1979. Two inquiries on racism have already been established and the French Parliament was the instigator in 1986 of a joint interinstitutional declaration."
"However, such initiatives are no longer enough."
"We must go further and legislate."
"The Buitenweg report is timely as racism and anti-Semitism are still of concern in Europe."
"Is this the right moment to reiterate our vigilance with regard to certain parties now in power?"
"With Mr Deprez and Mr De Clercq I tabled an amendment to the title of the directive."
"In the French version the Commission' s initial text uses the phrase 'sans distinction de race ou d' origine ethnique' ."
"The concept of origin is fundamental as discrimination may relate not only to the current status of an individual but also to his origin and descent."
"We wanted to introduce the same nuance and precision with regard to the issue of race and therefore proposed 'd' origine raciale' ."
"This amendment was adopted in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights but I note now that it has simply disappeared from the text submitted to you."
"We should like an assurance that this will be duly corrected."
"Also, although the issue of religion has been excluded from this directive for legal reasons, it is vital to reiterate that we are definitely not ignoring the forms of discrimination based on religious beliefs. Parliament has still to examine another Commission text in this respect."
"To conclude, the Buitenweg report is inspired by a proactive and progressive approach which I have supported."
"The risk of a resurgence of the neo-fascist and racist hydra requires close vigilance from us, more so now than ever before."
"We must lead the way in this fight."
"That concludes the vote."
"Trafficking in women (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on trafficking in women."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the magnificent work she has carried out on such a serious problem."
"The trafficking in women is having a very great impact, especially in the border countries of the European Union, where mafias are forming which deceive women with promises of employment and a better life, and which lead them eventually into prostitution and, in many cases, into situations which can only be described as slavery."
"This is a phenomenon related to our current society, in which immigration is beginning to cause a serious problem, since we are seeing significant movements of people who are seeking the kind of welfare society which we enjoy in the majority, or practically all, of the European Union countries."
"This situation requires a series of new measures, most importantly aiding victims and prosecuting the people involved in the trafficking in women and children - since it is not just a problem for women, but children as well - for sexual exploitation."
"Amongst the measures proposed in this report are basically aid to victims and the request that Member States amend their legislation in a way which will allow quicker and more coordinated action amongst the various countries in order to resolve this very serious problem."
"The victims do not only require material aid, but also legal assistance - because we are generally talking about people with no documentation, with no options and who are living in fear and need help - which, at the same time, protects their identity and guarantees that they will not suffer even worse problems if they return to their countries of origin."
"The different countries of the European Union must harmonise their legislation in this respect and implement sufficient measures to help these victims."
"The trade in sex is increasing at an alarming rate."
"Women and children are involved."
"I believe that the media should also aid this process, because we are seeing more and more adverts in the press - sometimes in the very serious newspapers - behind which lies the trafficking in women and exploitation."
"However, it is not only through legal assistance and through protecting the victims that we must address the problem, but also through information campaigns, mainly in the countries of origin, so that these women know what they are really exposing themselves to, since the majority of them are being deceived and do not realise the hell they are about to walk into."
"Mr President, every year, half a million women are tricked or forced into lives as sex slaves."
"This greatly increasing trade is more profitable than drug smuggling and is increasingly being directed by an organised mafia for trafficking in women."
"Despite this grim reality, the penalty for trafficking in women is exceedingly small compared with that for serious drug smuggling."
"It amounts to perhaps two years' imprisonment compared with ten to fifteen years for serious drug-related offences."
"Few offenders are brought to court, and still fewer prosecuted."
"The EU has so far exemplified the fact that words are not always translated into reality."
"Despite a number of statements from the EU about the appalling traffic in women, there is still no complete database with information about victims, trade routes, legislation or measures to be taken."
"The European women' s lobby reports that only 0.036 per cent of the EU' s budget for the year 2000 has been set aside for issues of equality and that only a fraction of this fraction goes on measures to combat trafficking in women."
"A growing number of women are being smuggled in from the candidate States."
"In spite of this, the EU has not made demands upon these countries to prevent, and to introduce measures against, trafficking in women, similar to the demands that have been made regarding economic and environmental objectives to be attained by the candidate States."
"By not complying with existing laws and not creating new laws to tackle the mafia concerned, the governments of Europe are indirectly allowing this demand-driven trade to increase."
"There is a lack of legislation, not only in terms of measures to combat the aforesaid mafia, but also in terms of laws to protect the victims."
"All but two Member States send victims of the trafficking in women back to their countries of origin, in spite of the possibility that their lives may be in danger."
"We are voting today, or hopefully tomorrow, on an attempt to convert rhetoric and fine words into concrete measures."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is demanding that the Member States provide women who give evidence with protection and refugee status."
"We demand tough, exemplary penalties for trafficking in women, together with national informants on trafficking in women, able to inform their governments about developments in their own countries, as well as in other countries."
"We demand measures to combat the increasing use of the Internet for the purpose of trafficking in women, and we demand that national police forces and embassy officials be given appropriate training and that increased resources be made available for the voluntary organisations which provide aid to victims."
"Before the end of this year, the governments of the Member States will presumably have decided upon a new Treaty."
"We assume that this Treaty will contain a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women, including, of course, trafficking in women, and that we shall be devising a common European policy for combating the trade in human beings."
"Among the issues which should be covered by this policy is that of immigration and asylum, especially that of the right to asylum on the grounds of sexually motivated oppression and sexually motivated persecution."
"In the United States and Russia, slavery was abolished in the 1860s. It has to be said, however, that the incidence of slavery is increasing, despite the fact that we have now entered the twenty-first century."
"This new form of slavery mainly affects women and girls but, irrespective of who is being enslaved, the mere presence of slavery is humanity' s best evidence of poverty."
"Many now support the demand to put a stop to the female slave trade, but more is needed in terms of manpower, intervention by governments and concrete action."
"Mr President, it is quite incredible to stand in this Chamber - I can hardly call it an Assembly right now - and realise that we, in fact, have an on-going slave trade in the European Union, too - here, where we commend ourselves for creating peace, freedom, democracy and human rights."
"It is a serious matter that we should have this type of trade, because it is often not even adult women who are affected but near-children and very, very young people."
"This trade is very closely linked to drugs and money laundering."
"Presumably, it is different types of mafia which control it."
"This report is very good."
"Like the previous speaker, I want to emphasise that we need to see action taken and that police cooperation needs to be developed and more information made available."
"I am often sceptical about the very large demands, for example with regard to the environment, which are being made of the candidate States."
"At the same time, I think it would be reasonable to demand that information be provided to the countries' own citizens, with other information being directed specially at young women."
"This measure would not, in fact, require large resources, and it is entirely feasible to implement it."
"I can therefore only appeal to everyone to vote in favour of the report and to go home and work on their own governments, organisations and the media, too."
"Mr President, prevention is better than cure."
"This seems to be an impossible task in the case of trafficking in women."
"Within EU territory and especially in the Central and Eastern European countries, the commercial exploitation of women is flourishing."
"In the rapporteur' s report, it appears that the measures taken so far have been to little avail."
"If we really want to prevent trafficking in women, we will need to adopt a different approach."
"We cannot put a stop to this trade by amending immigration and asylum policy and the legalisation of prostitution."
"And although I am generally in favour of good working conditions, these too cannot halt the trafficking in women."
"After all, as long as the demand for prostitutes is still there, there will always be women who, enticed by better prospects presented to them, will - often unwittingly - make themselves available as merchandise."
"It is not only heartless criminal organisations, but also rich, and not so rich, customers who help perpetuate the slave labour of these women who have no other prospects."
"We cannot bridge this chasm between rich and poor with a few initiatives organised at Community level."
"In addition to a sound and generous development policy in order to improve the living conditions of women in our own countries, it is necessary to question the lack of moral standards within our society."
"By imposing heavy penalties on criminal organisations which indulge in trafficking in people, we clearly denounce this type of practice."
"Only in this way can trafficking in women be effectively pushed back."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for her very valuable report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in 1996, we more or less got the political go-ahead to tackle trafficking in women at European level, and I am delighted to tell you that the then Belgian government played a vital role in bringing about this green light."
"But I think we need to ask ourselves whether, after four years of work, Europe is sufficiently equipped to be able to fight this trafficking in women effectively."
"I think I can assume that the Sörensen report makes it abundantly clear that this is not the case."
"We back Mrs Sörensen' s report 100% and I would like to congratulate her on her sterling work."
"I would especially like to re-emphasise the fact that the resolutions, which we will be approving tomorrow, fail to display a coherent legal framework for tackling trafficking in women, an issue which, in fact, the Belgian government made a point of hammering home at the time."
"I think that everyone by now realises that a coherent approach to trafficking in people first and foremost presupposes a clear definition of trafficking in women, which, indeed, is not restricted to forced prostitution, although this is very important, but encompasses all types of trafficking in women and which is linked to deterrent sanctions involving trafficking in people."
"I think it is beyond dispute that the national laws and methods for tracing victims and prosecuting offenders within the world of trafficking in women should be harmonised as a matter of urgency and that it is important that police forces work together more effectively."
"A second point which is essential to us in this report - and we have been hammering on about this for a while now - is the fact that we need to continue to be committed to the protection of women who are the victims of such types of trafficking."
"All too often in many countries, those women are criminalised whereas, in fact, they are the victims."
"What we are advocating is a legal residence status for those women so that they can be protected."
"Thirdly, I think it is clear that without such a legal framework, we will never reach a solution to this problem."
"In fact, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Vitorino at this stage on his intention to present a framework decision to the Council within the course of this year, as a result of which we would then be able to resolve a number of these bottlenecks and issues."
"Patsy Sörensen, our rapporteur, knows the topic of her report like the back of her hand."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner, since he is here, when drafting his future policy on trafficking in people, to talk to police forces and the civil service - this goes without saying - but I would very much urge him to make ample time for workers at base and aid workers in the field."
"After all, it is also their expertise which can ensure that our approach to trafficking in women is coherent and all-encompassing."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Sörensen for her report, which contains many proposals, and for the emphasis placed on the fact that trafficking in women and children is a violation of human rights."
"The body and the human person are not commodities."
"Even though many women choose to become prostitutes as an easy way of making a living, I would make no distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution: all prostitution is exploitation."
"I would like to stress three points: firstly, trafficking and immigration."
"A closed border policy prompts immigrants to turn to criminal organisations in order to procure visas or enter the country concerned illegally."
"The Member States must develop a more united, responsible policy."
"Thirdly: the victims' rights."
"It was proposed that the European Union issue temporary residence permits to victims which would be conditional upon the victims giving evidence against the traffickers, but, as yet, Italy is the only State to issue permits which are not conditional upon the giving of evidence."
"I would like to finish by raising the question of clients."
"Commissioner Vitorino repeatedly stated the need to take into account the demand of this market, that is the clients."
"But who are the clients?"
"They could be our fathers, our sons or ourselves."
"It is our duty to do our part to bring about a radical change in the mentality and culture of our society."
"This means promoting policies which support women."
"Mr President, if we are to discuss trafficking in women, we have to be aware that we are talking about a form of slavery, a modern form of slavery in which the majority of the victims are women subjected to trafficking run by organised crime networks."
"Trafficking in human beings supplies various markets: the market in organs for medical transplants, the market in new-born babies for those who do not have any children and the sweatshop market."
"However, the greatest area of crime involves women, the majority of whom are victims of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation."
"The poverty and marginalisation of the women in their countries of origin, the high earnings guaranteed to traffickers and the low risks they incur, and the substantial demand for women for prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation are the factors behind the growth of this trade."
"The Tampere European Council recently charged the European Union to fight against illegal immigration and, amongst other things, against those who profit from the trafficking in human beings."
"Mrs Sörensen' s report goes beyond this perspective and gives absolute priority to the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"It is estimated that 500 000 women are trafficked every year, the majority of whom then work illegally, but the underground nature of the trade means that the true extent of the problem is unknown."
"The contribution of non-governmental organisations in revealing the causes, methods and consequences of the trafficking in women for sexual exploitation, and the support they provide for the victims, has brought about greater awareness of these issues."
"The STOP and DAPHNE programmes already represent a major contribution of the European Union, but we must not stop there."
"Mrs Sörensen' s excellent report stresses the links between the trafficking in human beings and the policy on immigration and asylum, and calls, in the first place, upon the Intergovernmental Conference to bring about integral communitarisation of European policy in this field."
"As the report requests, it will therefore be necessary to establish a legal framework and effective prevention, protection and victim support measures at European level."
"On the other hand, the Member States and candidate countries must intervene themselves at legislative, administrative and police levels in order to eliminate this crime and, at the same time, increase international cooperation with Europol and Interpol to fight criminal networks."
"At national level, refugee status must be granted to the victims of trafficking and they must be issued with residence permits."
"Some countries - Italy and Belgium - assisted by NGOs, have already introduced some early measures."
"Furthermore, information campaigns must be launched in the victims' countries of origin and an awareness action pursued in the Member States to raise public awareness, in particular, among the male population."
"- (EL) Mr President, with millions of people victim to the criminal activities of worldwide international trafficking gangs throughout the world and the terrifying spread of these networks to the European Union, we urgently need to take steps to fight this contemporary Lernaean Hydra."
"The Union and the Member States currently have no powers whatsoever to intervene efficiently and break up the gangs operating almost undisturbed in our midst and in our neighbourhoods."
"The public in Athens was shocked recently at the revelation that an Albanian immigrant, who had declared that he was a doctor, had kept a 13-year-old girl imprisoned in his apartment in a peaceful neighbourhood of Athens for nine months and prostituted her to some 50-60 respectable customers a day."
"I personally advocate therefore that all the strategies used to fight trafficking in and the sexual exploitation of women and children should call for harsh punishment, both for those who profit from the trade in human beings and for those who use the services of prostitutes, as is the case under Swedish and Canadian law."
"It would appear that the increase in human trafficking has coincided with the recent mass migration of people and the impoverishment of large sections of society."
"Le Monde recently published shocking information on the activities of human traffickers, who are taking advantage of the situation in Kosovo and working with international illegal immigration organisations in order to sexually exploit some 300 000 women in France, Germany and Belgium, women mainly from Kosovo, but also from Moldavia, Romania and Bosnia."
"Women are being held in concentration camps in conditions of true slavery and are being tortured before being forced into prostitution."
"What is happening is a disgrace to Europe in the 21st century and betrays a lack of political will and commitment to prioritise this issue."
"The Commission communication is satisfactory and Mrs Sörensen has presented an excellent report, but good intentions alone will not combat international organised crime."
"We need initiatives on several fronts: legislative and administrative measures, harmonisation of legislation and prosecution methods, harsh punishment, protection for victims and collaboration between police and judicial authorities."
"We also need to strengthen Europol with more funds and more staff so that it can start making joint prevention and prosecution plans with all the Member States and, of course, we need to strengthen non-governmental organisations."
"In other words, we need to implement all the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions immediately. All these are issues, Commissioner, on which we are making no progress whatsoever."
"Mr President and honourable Members of Parliament, the Commission welcomes the opportunity of participating in this debate on how to develop our common efforts in the fight against trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation following the Commission' s second communication of December 1998."
"I take the opportunity of paying my respects to my predecessor, Mrs Gradin, who was the author of that communication."
"May I extend my congratulations to the honourable Member, Mrs Sörensen."
"Her report is a very valuable contribution towards continuing our work."
"Before going into the more substantial parts of this subject, I would like to state that the Commission remains fully committed to keeping the fight against this degrading form of violation of human rights and human dignity high on the political agenda."
"We have proved that in the proposals that we put to the European Council of Tampere last October."
"As several Members have already emphasised, preventive and repressive measures, as well as measures to support the victims, together with international cooperation, must be given further encouragement."
"I noted that the resolution that you are going to vote on tomorrow and the report that we are discussing today contain a large number of requests to the Commission."
"I will therefore try to address a few of these key issues."
"I wish first of all to address the matter of improving existing penal law in the Member States as regards the criminalisation of traffickers of human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"As a starting point in this exercise, we have here the February 1997 instrument, but it has become quite clear that it has its shortcomings."
"As I understand, during the hearing in August, the Commission will present at the end of this semester a package of proposals on trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and children."
"We have, in my opinion, a firm basis for this in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Vienna Action Plan of 1998 and the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere."
"Therefore, we do not need to wait for any change in the Treaties: we have a clear legal basis to address this issue of making trafficking in women a criminal offence."
"Mrs Van Lancker said the proposal is based on a Council framework decision which will look in particular at how to ensure that all Member States have common definitions, common criminal offences and common sanctions."
"In addition, we need to consider in the drafting exercise horizontal judicial issues such as defining the competent jurisdiction, the rules on extradition and seizure of the proceeds of crime."
"One important aspect for the future is that when finally adopted, this proposal will form a part of the acquis communautaire."
"This means that the candidate countries will have to take it on board in the context of enlargement."
"Another important element closely related to improving efficiency in the conviction of traffickers is, as I have already mentioned to Parliament, granting temporary residence permits to victims of trafficking who are willing to give evidence."
"This was one of the Commission' s suggestions in its second communication."
"The package of proposals that I mentioned before will, therefore, be completed a bit later this year with a proposal for a directive that will cover the issue of temporary residence permits so as to ensure the protection of various victims of trafficking including the victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"This element must, however, be seen as a crucial complement to the first set of initiatives."
"As a matter of fact, there is a real difficulty in convicting those who are responsible for trafficking."
"Without the cooperation of the victims, we can never make sure that those who profit from this traffic are brought before a court and are duly convicted."
"It is extremely important to couple these two kinds of measures: criminalisation of trafficking and, at the same time, having a proactive policy on promoting the cooperation of the victims with the police and with the judiciary in convicting those who are responsible for such degrading activity."
"Talking about significant developments in the field of trafficking in women at European level, we also need to take a look at the various activities that are, and have been, supported by the STOP programme."
"Previous and future projects under the STOP programme cover several points that are highlighted in Mrs Sörensen' s report."
"In particular, I would like to mention two of the priorities set for this year, namely, assistance to victims and prevention."
"In applying a multidisciplinary approach, this will involve NGOs as well as law enforcement services and I believe that it is necessary to promote closer dialogue between the NGOs that act in this area and the law enforcement authorities."
"As the STOP Programme is now in its last financial year and has made a valuable contribution to the fight against trafficking at European level, the Commission will put forward a proposal for a renewal of the programme for another five-year period starting in 2001."
"The proposal will, of course, build on experience gained from the first programme."
"We also intend to offer the possibility of running multiannual projects which will improve the efficiency of the programmes."
"A word also needs to be said about implementation of the new DAPHNE Programme following the DAPHNE initiative adopted in 1997."
"Its scope, as you know, is to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women and children. This includes trafficking in women and the sexual exploitation of women."
"The programme will allow us, in addition to the STOP programme, to help victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation by providing a financial contribution of EUR 20 million in the period from 2000 to 2003."
"In addition, more focus has been given and needs to be given to developing our cooperation through specific projects with the candidate countries such as several Members have mentioned of Parliament."
"We share with these candidate countries a serious common problem, since there is a clear trend involving the Central and Eastern European countries as the most important region of origin of both victims of trafficking and perpetrators."
"The Commission has, therefore, opened DAPHNE to the candidate countries and will do the same under the STOP Programme."
"Finally, the Commission has also mobilised other sources of financing to promote both support to local NGOs in the candidate countries and prevention campaigns in countries of origin."
"In the framework of the new Transatlantic Agenda and in cooperation with the government of the United States of America, it has, for instance, carried out various information campaigns in Poland, Ukraine, Hungary and Bulgaria, to raise an awareness within the population and the public bodies of these countries."
"For the future we are exploring the possibility of new campaigns targeting new areas and new countries."
"This is an issue that has a relevant role to play in the Stability Pact for the Balkans."
"Last but not least, I wish to clearly underline the importance of the Union being involved in wider forms of international cooperation."
"The Commission is now actively participating in the work on the draft United Nations protocol on trafficking to supplement the draft convention on trans-national organised crime and I sincerely hope that the members of the United Nations will be able to adopt this new convention in autumn this year."
"In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to a point that we need to keep in mind when working against trafficking in women at European level."
"That point is that even though the European Union can, and must, play an active role against trafficking, the Member States have the prime responsibility."
"This means that we need to be careful when talking about measures such as automatic non-criminalisation of victims of trafficking, possibilities of NGOs bringing court action on behalf of the victims and investigative methods in criminal matters."
"In other words, we need to be clear about which objectives can be better achieved at European level taking into account the level of cross-border cooperation in place among the Member States."
"Honourable Members have an opportunity of adapting what I consider a piece of good work that not only confirms a coherent and multidisciplinary European policy on trafficking but also adds new impetus for further actions which are undoubtedly necessary at European level."
"I want to thank Mrs Sörensen for her knowledge, her expertise and her contribution to this common fight."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Readmission of third country nationals"
"The next item is the report (A5-0110/2000) by Ms Karamanou, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Initiative of the Republic of Finland with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation determining obligations as between Member States for the readmission of third country nationals (12488/1999 - C5-0319/1999 - 1999/0823(CNS))."
"Mr President, my report does indeed concern the proposal for a regulation submitted by the Finnish Presidency on the relations and obligations as between the Member States for the readmission of third country nationals inside the European Union."
"I am really sorry to have to say, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, that the proposal for a regulation has not been given the due attention, study and careful preparation needed when handling such a delicate and complicated matter."
"This lack of preparation has resulted in serious reservations, rejection or a lack of interest in the proposal for a directive by the European Commission and the Council and by the parliamentary committees responsible, i.e. the Committee on Freedoms and the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as on the part of non-governmental organisations, which the Finnish Presidency does not appear to have consulted."
"The Tampere conclusions noted that the Union needed a comprehensive approach to the phenomenon of immigration, which is clearly linked to a whole series of political questions which have remained unanswered."
"It is linked to respect for human rights and to the economic, social, political and cultural conditions in the person' s country of origin."
"As far as the question of readmission is concerned, the Member States already have the experience of agreements under European Political Collaboration and Schengen-type cooperation."
"This is a sensitive issue which calls for diplomatic collaboration."
"As far as the content of the Finnish initiative is concerned, there is no explanatory statement attached to the draft regulation."
"The initiative does not show any strategic vision."
"The draft seeks to lay down a Dublin-style system for illegal immigrants, following the model of the Convention on asylum seekers, the application of which, as we know, has proven to be highly problematic and ineffective."
"Priority is given in the proposal for a regulation to send back foreigners illegally present on the territory of Member States under a system of compulsory readmission operating between Member States."
"The regulation aims to determine which Member State is obliged to readmit a third country national in order to implement the agreement in question."
"The draft regulation does not debar a Member State from sending a foreigner who does not meet the conditions of entry or residence in a Member State back to his or her country of origin or another third country."
"This provision seems to empower Member States to take more severe decisions outside the scope of the proposed regulation."
"Other points which deserve criticism are the fact that any kind of solidarity between Member States is precluded, in particular as far as illegal border crossings and responsibility for the external borders of the European Union are concerned."
"The proposal is perhaps a way of exercising indirect pressure for the borders of the European Union to be fortified."
"Similarly, absolutely no consideration is given to the particular circumstances of persons who may have spent a long period of time in a Member State before being classed as illegal."
"Residence permits for asylum seekers are not included in the documents provided for in the regulation, thereby creating the possibility of undermining the protection afforded to them."
"The regulation permits readmission to another Member State to be requested within six months from the time when the authorities of the requesting Member State became aware that a third country national may be (not ""is"" ) illegally present."
"In other words, the proposal allows entry to the territory of a Member State to be proven on the basis of hypothetical evidence."
"The way in which the data required to identify persons to be readmitted is determined is open to every kind of abuse."
"However, the basic problem appears to be that no strategy or European policy has been devised on immigration."
"I consider, Commissioner, that we urgently need to prepare legal tools for the immigration directive, rather than confining ourselves to suppression and policing measures which are not subject to democratic control."
"We urgently need to implement the Tampere conclusions and devise a common European policy on asylum and immigration based on European humanitarian values and respect for fundamental human rights."
"Finally, we call on the European Commission to take the necessary legislative initiatives on all the issues which touch on immigration and, of course, to define the mutual obligations as between the Member States."
"We are aware, Commissioner, of your personal interest and of the difficulties facing the Council and assure you that any initiatives which you may table in this direction will have our undivided support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank Mrs Karamanou for cooperating in such a straightforward and excellent way."
"I know that we all had to work very quickly on this document, and at that time she was under additional pressure because of commitments at national level."
"She has already mentioned very many points, and I would just like to say that, as regards content, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was in agreement, as it was with the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"We only differed on a formal detail."
"On behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, we are also requesting that this Initiative of the Republic of Finland should be withdrawn."
"I am certain that it was very well intended, but it has not been thought through sufficiently."
"Legally speaking, it has thrown up more questions than it has supplied explanations."
"I would like to add a few important points."
"An initiative of this kind should not mean that people can just be shipped back and forth within our territory."
"Furthermore, as Mrs Karamanou has just said, this represents a programme singularly lacking in solidarity between the Member States."
"With regard to readmission agreements, they should not be used as a possible way of twisting the arms of countries in receipt of development aid by saying that they will only receive development aid and funds or cooperation if they also sign readmission agreements."
"This is bordering on blackmail."
"Last but not least, I would like to say that the readmission of persons illegally residing in our territory is another problem that can only be solved jointly, by working together to fight the root causes and to finally address the issues of integration and asylum in cooperation."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by highlighting the work of both the rapporteur and Mrs Echerer, the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I have had the opportunity to work with the rapporteur in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and it has been an honour for me to chair the committee that voted for Mrs Echerer' s excellent opinion."
"Mr President, we are facing a situation which is real problem: the progressive disappearance of internal borders means that non-EU citizens in both legal and illegal situations are moving freely amongst the Member States."
"If we are going to be realistic, this is a problem which, as the two rapporteurs have stressed, we must deal with fully, and, I might add, as a matter of urgency."
"My view of the Finnish initiative is much less critical than theirs."
"I believe we should stress the fact that the Finnish initiative was a very significant step forward from the moment it was put on the table, because it led the Council to get involved in a very urgent issue."
"In other words, at the time, the Finnish initiative played a fundamental role, and we might say that it has died as a result of its own success."
"The thinking behind the Finnish initiative means that its proposals no longer have any point, because they have now been fully adopted."
"What we need now is not a provocative initiative which points its finger at the problem and starts a debate, but rather we need to get down - calmly but immediately - to resolving this problem."
"Apart from that, I agree with many of the criticisms that have been made."
"I also agree with one which has been made implicitly but which has not been stated directly."
"We, as a legislating institution, cannot amend just any text; there are texts which are not amendable and texts which require a complete amendment."
"This is what we have done in the case of the Finnish initiative, at least in the PPE Group."
"We welcome the courage of the Finnish initiative, but we believe that this initiative will not seriously enable us to carry out the responsibilities that the European public has entrusted to us."
"Why not?"
"For the reasons which have been expressed, and which I would probably just be repeating: this initiative takes account of one aspect, the most repressive one, but that is only one aspect of the problem."
"What we need now, given the developments since Tampere, is a more global vision."
"The rapporteur is absolutely right to point out that this initiative does not take account of questions of procedure, or fundamental guarantees for the procedure, nor does it provide the necessary protection for the fundamental rights of those people who will be caught up in this type of procedure."
"Finally, it has not been pointed out - and I think it is important that it is - that what we do in this area must be coherent with the Member States' principles regarding readmission of third country nationals."
"All these types of bilateral agreement that are required are being negotiated."
"The PPE has presented two amendments which I hope this House - to take up what the two previous speakers have said - will support in tomorrow' s vote, thereby sending a political signal, and we ask the Commission to present a complete and coherent text sooner rather than later."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson for their report and opinion."
"I would also like to say on behalf of my Group that we fully support the proposal to refer this initiative back."
"We did not come to this conclusion because we wanted to make things easy for ourselves and not table any amendments, but because - as emerges from the explanatory statement, which is very comprehensive and convincing - too many fundamental requirements have simply not been met."
"We have heard about these shortcomings in the debate as well as reading about them in the reports."
"However, it is not because of these shortcomings that we are recommending that this specific initiative should be rejected. What is at stake here is whether it makes sense for the Member States to have the right of initiative in these areas of competence."
"The proposals on which Parliament has been consulted up to now under this right of initiative have not, on the whole, been very convincing - including an Austrian proposal that had both technical shortcomings and problems in terms of content."
"What these proposals have had in common has been a failure to fit in with a coherent set of measures."
"Something else they had in common was that they either conflicted with existing legal instruments or duplicated them."
"The advantage of the Commission alone having the right of initiative is surely that this ensures a systematic approach and guarantees that we have documents that are more precise and free from technical and legal contradictions. This applies in particular to matters for which Commissioner Vitorino is responsible."
"Another clear indication of the shortcomings of Member States' right of initiative is that they are seldom received with very much enthusiasm, even by other Member States."
"This also applies to the initiative before us today, which the Portuguese Presidency is no longer treating as a priority."
"So, as a Parliament, we have more reason than ever before to be sceptical about this right of initiative on the part of Member States. This is not only because this right skews the balance between the institutions but also because, up to now, it has never really been convincingly exercised."
"I would also like to touch upon another problem connected with this, which might perhaps warrant a joint initiative by the Member States."
"Officials working at the Schengen external borders are constantly telling us that the residence permits presented by third country nationals and issued by other EU Member States still vary widely and are often difficult to identify as such."
"This does not seem to fit in with the Joint Action concerning a uniform format for residence permits."
"The Member States should take the initiative here and act in compliance with the EU format in their own administrative area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I want to say that I am speaking as much as a Finn as in my capacity as a representative of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"I would thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson of the opinion for the frank, direct and sincere words they have written about Finland' s initiative."
"The report states that the initiative was poorly planned, that it contains no justification section, that it was prepared without organisations such as ECRE or UNHCR being consulted and that the relationship between the principles of readmission between the Member States and the principles of readmission to third countries is not made clear."
"Furthermore, the report states that there is a lack of strategic vision, something which the rapporteur also said."
"No distinction is made between those who do not fulfil and those who no longer fulfil the conditions in force for residence here."
"It is all too reminiscent of Austria' s initiative on that famous first day of Austria' s Presidency."
"There are also no procedural safeguards, which does not surprise me because, less than two months ago, the same Ministry of the Interior which is behind the present initiative proposed that Finnish immigration law be changed to include rapid repatriation."
"My party, the Swedish People' s Party, voted against this initiative, really for the same reasons that Finland' s constitutional committee had when it considered that the same proposal was unconstitutional because, in the case of rapid repatriation, no one has the right to be heard."
"It would be wisest, therefore, if Finland were to comply with Parliament' s proposal and withdraw the proposal, as both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs propose."
"I would point out that, of all the members of the Committees, only two supported this initiative."
"I regret that the Council' s and Parliament' s time has been used in this way."
"I think, like Mrs Berger said, that it could have been used for other things, for example, purely administrative procedures."
"The issue of women as asylum seekers might also have been reflected upon, because we need to look at the Tampere decision in its entirety with a view to improving the asylum process."
"I would emphasise that I am speaking as a Finn and as a representative of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"Mr President, the Karamanou report asks the European Parliament to reject the Finnish proposal to establish, within the European Union, a system for returning illegal immigrants to the Member State responsible."
"According to this initiative, a Member State which arrests illegal immigrants in its territory could return them to the Member State through which they entered, with the expectation that the latter would probably return them to the third country from which they originally came."
"This idea is interesting for three reasons."
"Firstly, it responds to a genuine problem caused by the abolition of internal borders within Europe. It therefore fills a legal void by establishing a system for the return of illegal immigrants based on the Schengen acquis and modelled on the Dublin Convention of 1990 on asylum seekers."
"Secondly, it forces the Member State which is negligent in monitoring its borders to take responsibility for illegal immigrants who use it to get into neighbouring countries."
"Thirdly, it shows the usefulness - whatever the previous speakers may have said - of the Member States' right of initiative which the Treaty of Amsterdam retained as a transitional measure in matters relating to immigration and the movement of people."
"In these areas, it is important that the national governments, which are still closer to the people than the Commission, should retain a full right to make proposals and, of course, decide on these."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights totally rejects this Finnish initiative however, and, in so doing, shows a tendency to exaggerate."
"It uses the pretext of legal shortcomings to reject the whole proposal whereas it could very easily, in a more positive spirit, have itself proposed corrections."
"However, this initiative is disliked by the federalists who would prefer a less intergovernmental and more Community-based approach, in other words granting more power to the Commission and the European Parliament."
"It is also disliked by the pro-immigration pressure groups whose influence is apparent in the explanatory statement which highlights the positive contribution of immigration and rejects a supposedly repressive initiative."
"This reasoning is, of course, diametrically opposed to ours."
"Mr President, the Commission would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report."
"Since we completely agree with her analysis and conclusion and share the view that it cannot be adopted, as it stands, I shall be very brief."
"Mrs Karamanou' s report has clearly demonstrated that the subject of readmission rules between European Union Member States, although a very technical and specific issue, touches upon some very sensitive policy issues that simply need more thorough reflection and preparation before they are again tackled by the Union."
"I recognise that this initiative has drawn the attention of the Council to the necessity of drafting a coherent and consistent approach to immigration policy."
"That is why I stated to Parliament the Commission' s intention of presenting to the Council and Parliament in the autumn of this year a communication on immigration policy, precisely to give us the broader picture within which these partial and sectoral issues can be fully and properly integrated."
"I can assure you that the Commission thinks that we should not start with this question of readmission."
"We think that though questions of readmission are no doubt relevant, they should be mainly addressed in the readmission agreements that the Union is now negotiating with third countries."
"Nevertheless, for the time being, it is better to see the whole picture before we start discussing small details."
"So the Commission can subscribe to the approach of the rapporteur and, apparently, the large majority in Parliament, in the sense that this initiative, as it stands - and I am not passing judgement on the intention behind it - is unacceptable."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, a gross mistake has found its way into Item 34 of the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting concerning the adoption of the resolution on Euro 2000."
"The Minutes show this resolution to have been adopted by Parliament when in fact it was rejected by an overwhelming majority. Moreover, the resolution is also listed among the texts adopted whereas notification of its rejection should appear in this part."
"This will obviously be corrected."
"Madam President, following your statement yesterday regarding the state of the air conditioning in the building, I have a slight problem in my position as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with Canada."
"I have a group of Canadian members of parliament coming to the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"I will have to take a decision on Monday as to whether they will be travelling to Strasbourg or Brussels."
"Bearing in mind the French position on the precautionary principle, can a decision be taken rather sooner than a fortnight on where we will be meeting next month?"
"Mr Sturdy, as you know, and as the Quaestors point out in the memo which you have received, checks will be carried out at Parliament' s three places of work, that is to say, Strasbourg, Brussels and Luxembourg."
"Unfortunately, we will then have to wait for the result of these checks."
"I would therefore advise you to contact Mr Poos, so that he can keep you informed of the situation."
"Madam President, I rise on the same point of order as my colleague, Mr Sturdy."
"It is essential that this Parliament should show by example and precept that it follows the same standards that it imposes upon everybody else."
"It imposes standards on beef in Britain and cheese in France and it must follow the same example in relation to its own conduct."
"I am perfectly prepared, in an extreme situation, to die for my country and my family. I am not prepared to die from legionnaire's disease because I have to sit in Strasbourg in June."
"Therefore we should do something about it now and not just talk about it."
"This is why, ladies and gentlemen, we are taking every necessary precaution at all Parliament' s places of work."
"Madam President, as you may well expect, we will not enter into a debate between French and British beef producers now. However, I have two questions to ask."
"Firstly, could the same checks be carried out for Parliament in Brussels?"
"Secondly, in accordance with the precautionary principle, can Brussels continue to be a place of work for Parliament since it is not equipped with air purifiers?"
"I have already answered the first question, Mr Daul, since I told you that the checks would also be carried out in Brussels as well as in Luxembourg where many people work, and this must not be overlooked."
"The checks will therefore be carried out at all Parliament' s places of work, but Mr Poos will be in a much better position to answer you than myself."
"Madam President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"I would like to inform and at the same time reassure the Members who have just spoken on this important and serious matter."
"I should like to point out to them that the College of Quaestors has acted in accordance with the precautionary principle."
"In fact, if the College of Quaestors had not ordered an air quality check in these buildings, the problem would not even have been mentioned today in plenary."
"This check has therefore been carried out and, as you know, it proved negative on two points."
"We took the necessary steps immediately, namely closing the buildings where the problems were observed."
"After technical changes had been made, we carried out a second air quality check, the results of which are available for asbestos."
"The second check did not reveal any more asbestos fibres, suggesting that they had been brought in from outside, or could well have been."
"We are quite certain that asbestos was not used to construct the building."
"Furthermore, a second check has been carried out for the ducts contaminated with legionella bacteria, but the results of this are not available yet for purely technical reasons, as well as biological reasons, because the cultures take about a fortnight to mature."
"At any rate, the results of this second check will be available by the start of the next part-session in Strasbourg, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that if they should be positive, i.e. if these pathogenic elements are found to be still present, then the College of Quaestors will advise the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents to take the necessary action."
"There is therefore no cause for alarm at present."
"We shall wait for the results of these checks and we shall take the necessary steps in accordance with the precautionary principle."
"Madam President, in Item 5 of the Minutes of yesterday' s sitting on the withdrawal of Mr Le Pen' s mandate, there are two half truths in the references to my speech and to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and two half truths can add up to one untruth."
"Firstly, the Minutes state that Mr Medina Ortega 'questioned whether the letter from the committee' s chairman truly reflected the opinion of the committee as a whole' ."
"What I said was that the letter read out by the President and sent by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi was not the opinion of the committee. It had not been adopted by the committee and therefore was not its opinion."
"It is not a question of whether or not it reflected the committee' s opinion: reflecting an opinion is not the same as being an actual opinion."
"Secondly, the Minutes then state that Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi 'confirmed that the letter faithfully reflected the committee' s position' ."
"Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi is not here but, if I remember rightly, what she said was something along the lines of it being her opinion of what had taken place in committee, although it had not been adopted by the committee."
"Although I am aware that I am splitting hairs here, I should like to make it clear that what I said was that it was not the committee' s opinion and that, in some way, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi acknowledged that it was her opinion of what happened in committee."
"In this way, the two half truths could be turned into two complete truths."
"Mr Medina, I suggest that we listen again to the recording of the sitting and, if necessary, make the changes you specify."
"However, given that this is a very delicate area, I think we must listen to the recording of the sitting first in order to see whether these changes are really necessary."
"If they appear to be necessary, the changes will indeed be made."
"Madam President, it is all very well Mr Poos saying that the Quaestors asked for the air quality check."
"I understand that the staff asked for an air quality check before this building was opened."
"I asked for an air quality check in January."
"Why has it taken so long to get that air quality check?"
"Usually, in a lot of countries, if legionella bacteria is found in any part of a building, that building is closed."
"Are there any other comments on the Minutes?"
"There are no further comments."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Vote"
"Madam President, I rise under Rule 126(3) so that I might question whether a quorum exists for this vote."
"Despite the unprecedented presence of some French Members, my assessment is that Fridays in Strasbourg do not function properly and effectively for this Parliament and we should transfer more of our parliamentary work to the capital city, Brussels."
"- (PT) Madam President, I would like to speak in reaction to the blatant hypocrisy of the request that has just been made."
"During yesterday' s vote on the Buitenweg report, we witnessed some very serious goings-on in this Parliament."
"Rules of Procedure were brushed aside so that we could proceed to the vote on the Buitenweg report, which bears the name of one of the leading lights of the group, whose spokesperson today is Mr Duff, perhaps because of some embarrassment on the part of Mrs Buitenweg."
"Given what happened yesterday, which none of us has forgotten - we were forced to listen to hypocritical statements about great principles when, in the April part-session, for example, a motion on Ethiopia was sacrificed - I would ask the leaders of this group to show, at least in this part-session, some remorse at what they have done and some respect for their colleagues."
"Madam President, I should like to convey our support and sympathy for the people of Paraguay in the light of another attempted military coup."
"That is all I wished to say."
"I should like the position of this House to be made very clear."
"Madam President, due to the absence of two dozen Members and the request for the quorum which we would have established without any difficulty, our Group yesterday chose to refrain from preventing the Buitenweg report from being put to the vote when this would have been quite possible. According to the agenda, the vote should have taken place today since the amendments were not put to the House in time yesterday."
"I appealed to the House to act fairly."
"I would urge the Members dealing with this matter to declare a moratorium."
"We are about to take up the matter of enhancing the status of Fridays."
"Of course, the best way to do this would have been by voting on this important report today."
"However, I believe Mrs Buitenweg cannot attend today' s sitting."
"In any event, we must nevertheless enhance the status of Fridays."
"Our Group is in the process of taking appropriate precautionary action."
"I would urge you to let us work fairly and to stop deliberately disrupting our work."
"As I already said yesterday, I can tell you again that within the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, we are in fact in the process of enhancing the status of the work undertaken on Fridays."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to address the mover of the motion, Mr Duff, since this is still, after all, a question on a point of order which is to be debated in this House."
"Mr Duff, yesterday a vote was taken in the House on the Buitenweg report, as a result of which, the Karamanou and Sörensen reports have to be put to the vote this morning."
"This is also the reason why Mrs Buitenweg, who is otherwise requesting a quorum on this, is nobly expressing her reservation because she knows that voting on these reports this morning is the fair thing to do."
"In this respect, Mr Duff' s request might have been overlooked among the large number of requests made."
"He has not been given any information, which explains why he has made this request now."
"I would therefore urge Andrew to withdraw his request, since Mrs Buitenweg and others want a vote to be taken on the Sörensen and Karamanou reports this morning."
"I would certainly suggest that Mrs Buitenweg and others refrain from making a big fuss about it this morning in order to avoid embarrassing scenes."
"Madam President, the issue of requests for the quorum to be tested does not have anything to do with whether we work in Strasbourg rather than in Brussels."
"Personally, I would prefer to work in Strasbourg, but I consider that if we have decided to work on Fridays - and this seems to me to be the issue here - then on Fridays the quorum needs to be present."
"I do not feel that it is right to vote in favour of working on Fridays and then be absent."
"With regard to whether requests for the quorum to be tested are intended to sabotage proceedings, I would refer you to events in the Italian Parliament."
"I myself have requested that the quorum be checked many, many times, and, on most of those occasions, the quorum was not present."
"Yet I have never been accused of sabotaging proceedings and I doubt that the war which has broken out between Ethiopia and Eritrea was caused by the fact that, last time, the quorum was not present."
"Madam President, as Chairperson of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I was a touch surprised at the request to establish that a quorum was present today."
"We moved our two topics so that Mrs Buitenweg' s report could be discussed and voted on yesterday."
"Mrs Sörensen' s and Mrs Karamanou' s reports were therefore moved to yesterday evening to be debated, and were to be voted on today."
"I think it is odd, to say the least, that our colleagues should behave in this way."
"It may perhaps be possible for my colleague to withdraw the proposal and appreciate the need to realise that half the earth' s population consists of women."
"It is an extremely serious document which Mrs Sörensen has written and which we shall be voting on today."
"I would most earnestly ask my colleagues to stop trifling with this Parliament and withdraw their proposal - perhaps with the help of Mrs Buitenweg."
"Madam President, I just wanted to correct what Mr Posselt said."
"He said that he did not think there was a quorum on the vote on Mrs Buitenweg's report."
"By my calculations, 242 people voted on that report including about 35 Members of the PPE, and they should be congratulated on supporting that excellent report yesterday."
"Madam President, before we take a vote - and I would rather a vote not be taken straight away - I should also like to join Mrs Theorin in appealing to Mr Duff as a friend and colleague to withdraw his request to establish the quorum."
"Last time, at the Friday sitting here in Strasbourg, a request of this type had a disastrous effect on the European Parliament' s image."
"It was broadcast on television the same day that there were not enough Members present in plenary to discuss aid to Ethiopia."
"Pictures of children who had died from famine and starving people were shown at the same time by the same channels."
"The same thing will happen today with the fight against trafficking in women."
"Pictures of poor girls living in districts that are unfit for habitation will be shown, and it will be broadcast that not enough Members were present in Parliament to discuss the matter."
"So, please, I beg you to withdraw your request to establish the quorum, and let us take a vote!"
"Mr Duff, do you uphold your request?"
"We shall then see if 32 Members join you."
"Madam President, should these reports be serious then they certainly deserve a quorum."
"What I will do is to press my point of order."
"Very well, so are there 32 Members to support this request?"
"(24 Members rose) The request is therefore withdrawn."
"We shall now proceed to the vote. First, we shall examine the text of the initiative from the Republic of Finland."
"The Commission proposes that the initiative be rejected."
"Madam President, I think you are mistaken as the voting list is different."
"If we want to reject Finland' s initiative, we must vote against it."
"That is primarily what we are voting on."
"So whoever votes in favour, votes for the Finnish proposal which was rejected by committee."
"Whoever votes against, rejects the Finnish proposal and thus gives the Commission the responsibility of presenting a relevant proposal, as represented by the subsequent amendments tabled."
"Madam President, this is a very complicated process as Mrs Karamanou has already explained."
"I would therefore urge you to allow me to very briefly explain the process once again."
"I have also agreed to do this with the member of the PPE Group who works as a coordinator in our committee, since the PPE has proposed two amendments, although only for the legislative resolution."
"The text of the resolution itself should be rejected."
"However, I would urge a vote to be taken on the legislative resolution, together with both amendments, in which it is pointed out that we invite the Council to put forward a new draft text."
"The present text should therefore be rejected and the Council invited in the legislative resolution to submit a new text."
"It therefore comes down to the rather unusual process of the text which is actually to be voted on being rejected, but a vote then having to be taken on the legislative resolution."
"I would urge that this rather remarkable procedure be carried out."
"It gives us the chance to obtain a new text."
"Indeed, it is quite complicated."
"You would therefore like me to put the draft initiative from the Republic of Finland to the vote straight away."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal, which was referred back to committee) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"(A5-0127/2000) by Mrs Sörensen, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ""For further actions in the fight against trafficking in women"" (COM(1998) 726 - C5-0123/1999 - 1999/2125(COS))"
"Before the start of the vote"
"Madam President, on the same point of order that Mr Duff raised earlier, the roll-call vote has just shown that we are not quorate, so therefore, under the same rules, I would like to ask for the quorum to be established and I call on Members to support me by standing."
"(19 Members rose)"
"President."
"The request is withdrawn."
"Relating to Amendment No 10"
"Madam President, with regard to this amendment, there is a linguistic problem."
"The French version contains the word ""délit"" , whereas this is written as ""crime"" in the English version."
"As you know, Madam President, this does not have the same meaning in French."
"The amendment seeks to correct this."
"I am not the one who tabled the amendment, but it does seem to me that this is the point of it. I wanted to point this out."
"Relating to Amendment No 5"
"Madam President, in the course of discussions with Mrs Martens of the PPE-DE Group, we decided to alter the amendment to paragraph 19 in this way."
"It stresses the vital role played by the NGOs, which might also include humanitarian organisations in Europe that have set themselves the task of receiving and supporting the victims."
"I endorse this amendment."
"You are therefore proposing an oral amendment to replace the words 'the churches and religious organisations' with 'humanitarian organisations' ."
"Madam President, I am not quite clear as to whether the words 'church organisations' should appear in the text."
"If not, I should like us to return to the original wording."
"You, Madam President, said one thing and Mrs Sörensen another."
"Would you be so kind as to repeat what the oral amendment should really consist of?"
"In order to make things crystal clear, I think that the best thing would be to listen to the rapporteur again so that everyone understands in his own language exactly what the oral amendment which you are proposing would consist of."
"I apologise for the lack of clarity."
"The oral amendment alters Amendment No 5 to paragraph 19 as follows: we want to keep ""stresses the vital role played by NGOs"" and then the words in bold in the original amendment are to be altered thus: ""which may also include humanitarian organisations in Europe that have set themselves the task of receiving and supporting the victims"" ."
"And so 'the Churches and religious organisations' is to be replaced by ""humanitarian organisations"" , because that is a much broader concept."
"I think that things have now been made quite clear."
"Are there at least 12 Members who are opposed to this oral amendment being considered?"
"(As more than 12 Members were opposed, the oral amendment was not considered)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Sörensen report (A5-0127/2000)"
"Madam President, it was with great pleasure that I voted for the Sörensen report."
"I fully approve the contents of the report, but, sadly, I feel that it fails to get to the root of the issue."
"The motion for a resolution states that 500 000 people, victims of trafficking in women, enter Europe every year."
"The true responsibility for trafficking in women lies with the men who take advantage of them in Europe - in the order of 180 million people, according to my calculations."
"The point I am trying to make in this explanation of vote can also be found on page 11, line 14 of the report, and it is the only line out of the 722 making up the report which reaches the crux of the matter: it states that we must fight for ""information and awareness-raising activities with a view to reducing the demand side"" ."
"Out of the 7 213 words in this report, a mere handful are dedicated to the truth."
"- (FR) Once again we are confronted with one of the most sordid aspects of contemporary society: trafficking in human beings."
"And once again, Parliament responds to this by using an incoherent form of language whose repetition is discouraging."
"Indeed, whilst the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities rightfully condemns trafficking in women and children as an intolerable violation of basic human rights, at the same time it denounces what it considers to be the disastrous effects of the prohibition of prostitution."
"But are the measures which we are rightfully calling for from national and Community institutions any good if we politicians fail to proclaim, beforehand, that this truly basic right to human dignity is being violated by sexual exploitation, particularly prostitution?"
"Let us take advantage of the fact that Parliament is presently involved in the work of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to think about the direction we want this to take."
"Is it about proclaiming a vision of the human being, and the sacredness and intrinsic dignity thereof, or recognising the rights of individuals in isolation and of separate impenetrable communities?"
"I will be told in reply that prostitution has always existed and that we should instead try to limit the damage it does."
"This scourge, like so many others, has certainly always existed and regrettably will no doubt always exist, but our task as elected representatives forces us to take a better and wider perspective, regarding what destroys the human being not as an inevitability but as a crime to be combated."
"The libertarian decriminalisation measures have proved to be inefficient and dangerous no matter what the field."
"Let me remind some of my colleagues of the role played by these laws: by prohibiting certain practices, they set limits intended to protect those persons, male and female, who for different reasons are easy targets for criminal networks which exploit, and prosper on, their poverty."
"If these laws are not enough to break up the networks, then we must also provide the competent authorities with the means to conduct a campaign which is all the more efficient since it will be supported by unambiguous legislation."
"The unspeakable excesses of some people are often a sign of some distress which must also be put right."
"It is criminal to use the weakness of certain individuals to promote a libertarian ideology which spreads distress further afield and ultimately smells of death."
"- (FR) The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities proposes a large number of ambitious legal measures in the Sörensen report."
"Nevertheless, all the proclaimed rights, protective measures and international cooperation are only any good if they are inspired by the higher fundamental principles which they are intended to serve."
"It would therefore be useful for us to start by solemnly reasserting that the dignity of all human beings is at stake here, and that any compromise with practices violating this is irresponsible and criminal."
"When you know about the terrible things that go on within paedophile networks, when you see women displayed as goods for sale in shop windows in European capitals, and when you are aware of the distress suffered by the victims of this exploitation, you can only reject the thoughtless and criminal texts which suggest decriminalisation based on a libertarian ideology with no regard for the need to protect, albeit imperfectly, the weakest members of society."
"It is essential that, in Member States and in any cooperation between them, the basic principles of human dignity regain a central place, and are promoted and defended by policies to protect victims and prosecute those responsible."
"It is essential that an ambitious development aid policy is implemented beforehand."
"This must be concerned with offering poor countries the means to develop, so that they can give their inhabitants the chance of a decent life: this process has an economic facet, but also in particular cultural and educational aspects."
"Admittedly, there is a constant demand for what is called 'the sex industry' , but we must try to prevent adults from selling themselves or their children to such networks because it is the only means of meeting their needs."
"It is particularly through educating young people as well as adults that these people will be able to create their own means of subsistence in their respective regions."
"At the same time, it is also up to us to create in our own countries the legal and social frameworks necessary for helping the victims and fighting against a scourge all too often presented as an inevitability or even a quaint tradition."
"Non-NAFO vessels"
"The next item is the report (A5-0101/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non-Contracting Parties to the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) (COM(1999) 570 - C5-0041/2000 - 1999/0231(CNS))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, regional fisheries organisations, which regulate fishing operations outside the 200 miles of exclusive economic zones, play a fundamental role in the regulation and rational management of fishery resources in international waters."
"They will be called upon to play an even more important role in the immediate future."
"As a result, the European Union must strengthen its presence in such regional organisations, in those that already exist and in those that may be created in the future."
"Unfortunately, in terms of human and technical resources, the European Commission is, in our opinion, currently unable to be present in each and every one of these regional fisheries organisations with the commitment they deserve, or in a way that reflects the important interests the different Community fleets have in the various oceans on this planet."
"NAFO is an exception and has perhaps become the best attended, most regulated and most monitored organisation of them all."
"It is also true that the Commission is paying greater attention to some of these organisations, as in the case of the ICCAT."
"This is certainly an organisation that is no stranger to pressure from this House and, more specifically, from our Committee on Fisheries."
"However, there are a number of other organisations - to mention only those that relate to the tuna species - and, alongside the aforementioned Atlantic tuna organisation, there is a pressing need for our presence in, and commitment to, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, the IOTC, the Inter-American Commission for Tropical Tuna, the IATTC, or the MHLC, the Multilateral High Level Conference, which is negotiating the convention that will govern the Western Pacific Council."
"The European Commission needs to have an effective presence, both in terms of human and technical resources, in all these organisations and, as I said, in those that may be created in the future."
"Parliament will help, and we shall spare no effort in ensuring that, in such organisations, the European Union has a level of influence that corresponds to our fisheries sectors. These sectors are calling for such an influence in view of third countries which, incidentally, sometimes defend their interests more vigorously than we defend ours."
"NAFO has served as a model in many cases."
"The regulation we are now considering represents an attempt to incorporate decisions adopted by the organisation in 1997, 1998 and 1999 into Community legislation to make our internal measures more effective."
"In this case, we are dealing with the thorny issue of trying to ensure that vessels which are not part of the organisation respect the rules laid down by regional fisheries organisations. Such vessels, whether operating under flags of convenience or not, simply act freely whilst others respect provisions on the conservation of resources and, of course, contribute to these respective laws."
"We support the measures drawn up, measures which are still scarce and difficult to apply, but which will continue to increase the world' s awareness of responsible fishing and trade and make such awareness more effective."
"The measures suggested by this House' s Committee on Fisheries are along these lines. They are measures which clarify some concepts to ensure greater accuracy and improve, as far as possible, upon the already significant control measures in NAFO waters."
"As we all know, a Community vessel that was operating in NAFO waters, the Santa Mafalda, has been ordered into the Portuguese port of Aveiro with Canadian NAFO inspectors on board."
"Whilst we await the findings of the port inspection, we ask everyone to comply with the NAFO fisheries' regulatory measures. These measures on the conservation of resources are essential if such resources are to be maintained."
"We also call on the Canadian authorities to behave in accordance with NAFO control measures and not to exceed their authority. During the plenary sitting on this matter, Mr Kinnock, Vice-President of the Commission, acknowledged that they had exceeded their duties in appropriating the ship' s documentation without the authorisation of the captain of the vessel."
"Attitudes such as these remind us of a time we thought we had left behind, a time when Canada created a crisis, which we do not wish to see repeated under any circumstances."
"Therefore, we ask for a forceful response from the European Commission to Canada over their behaviour and - I should like to stress this and then conclude - we ask everyone to behave appropriately in order to conserve resources and we ask them to comply strictly with the rules laid down by NAFO."
"Madam President, Commissioner, for some time we have been observing with increasing concern an influx of vessels, which do not belong to NAFO, the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, into the North-West Atlantic."
"To be quite frank, the owners of these vessels are stealing fish."
"They deliberately refuse to join NAFO, of which the European Union is a member."
"They think they can shirk all their responsibilities by doing so."
"We have known for a long time what kind of problems the fishing industry as a whole has to contend with."
"Overfishing certainly plays an important part in this regard."
"What we therefore need, at the end of the day, is a coherent fishing policy, not just in our waters, but worldwide, where all parties act in concert and cannot play their own game."
"This concerns everyone: the international community, individual countries and the European Union."
"NAFO is therefore more important than you would think for everyone, and not just for the European Union."
"The consequences of uncontrolled fishing have already been disastrous, particularly for cod and redfish, two highly valued sources of food."
"Regulations - that is, either a total ban on fishing or at least clear restrictions on fishing - have been in force for both types of fish on the part of NAFO ever since the 1990s."
"In spite of all the efforts even simply to make these often stateless vessels comply with the protective and conservation measures, fishing continues to proceed unabated."
"The problem for the European Union was previously the lack of a unified system of control when checking vessels of non-contracting parties in EU ports because they are obviously not subject to Community law."
"By transferring the NAFO regulations as international law directly into Community law which is in force in all EU Member States, the regulation presently under discussion thus gains importance."
"The NAFO regulations - and their assimilation in a unified system - which control and, if necessary, sanction the non-contracting parties and their frequently stateless vessels and fishing, are therefore the most important matter dealt with in the regulation."
"Those who took part in a psychological study which exists in Germany, and which is appropriately named the 'Fishing Game' , always headed for a resources catastrophe when they acted in isolation."
"In the final analysis, every one of them always took whatever was still left and this could no longer be replaced at the end."
"If we do not want to just have the choice between unreliable sources of food or unreliable fishing, then a functional form of cooperation between all the parties involved would be in our interests."
"As a member of NAFO, and with a large number of Member States of its own, the EU fulfils the requirements for this."
"We therefore welcome this initiative, but would like a few minor points to be clarified in our motions in order to achieve greater coherency between NAFO and the EU."
"A final word on this interesting term 'international law '."
"EU law also has its origins in international law."
"Certainly, we must now realise that EU Community law has become a term in its own right, and that this must be analogous to the evolving definition of the term 'European Union' ."
"Mr President, in his speech, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna has already mentioned the forceful response from the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Kinnock, to my question on the boarding by Canadian inspectors of a Portuguese fishing vessel in NAFO waters."
"If we are to maintain the balance in this important organisation - and in what is an extremely important fishing ground for the Community fleet - then the only way to do so is for everyone to behave responsibly."
"The proposal for a regulation under discussion today, on control measures for vessels from countries which are non- Contracting Parties to NAFO, is very much linked to this sense of responsibility that is so necessary in the fisheries sector."
"I am referring to the responsibility we all share for managing marine resources, in accordance with rules accepted by all parties to guarantee that such resources are preserved and that ours will not be the last generation to see cod, redfish or American plaice."
"Regional fishing organisations have played an increasingly important role over recent years in the management of resources."
"In this respect, we, the Socialists, would like to continue developing the idea that encourages this sense of responsibility."
"Legal philosophies dating from times gone by have been left behind, times when man felt how small he was in relation to the immensity of the Earth, which appeared to be a planet with infinite resources."
"The lack of ownership of the seas and the principle that the sea belongs to no one sprang from such ideas."
"However, nowadays, in a world that is becoming ever smaller, a world dominated by new technologies that make the world even smaller and with resources we know are becoming more and more scarce, we, the Socialists would like to move forward on the principle that the sea belongs to everyone."
"For this reason, we would like NAFO to be - and indeed it is - an organisation open to countries that have vessels operating in this area."
"In this way, such countries would play a part in creating regulatory measures and would share responsibility for managing resources."
"If this does not happen, flags of convenience, euphemistically known as 'non-Contracting Parties' , will benefit, not to mention the piracy which lies behind the euphemism, 'stateless vessels' ."
"Such vessels - which we are often keen to believe have nothing to do with us - do not come from remote southern seas, but rather almost always originate from European ports, from Community ports."
"They fly strange flags and their aim is to practise social dumping. In so doing, they avoid regulations on the rational management of resources and pay no attention to workers' social rights."
"People who idolise the market should note from this that neither fish nor people gain anything from their hypotheses."
"Lastly, it is extremely important that countries with vessels operating in NAFO waters are Contracting Parties, just as it is important that the European Community is also a Contracting Party to regional organisations being set up in the South Atlantic and beyond the area the Community fleet currently operates in."
"Our fleet, the Community fleet, does not wish to be seen as a pirate fleet, as a fleet without nationality, nor as an intruding fleet."
"To conclude, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to state that it wholeheartedly agrees with the content of this report although it regrets, as does the rapporteur himself, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, that there is a lack of proposed measures from the Commission on combating the main enemy of our fleet and of the conservation of fishery resources today. This enemy is none other than those vessels flying flags of convenience."
"I would very much like to support this report."
"It is extremely important and it is very important to support the attempts of NAFO to halt this very problematic activity of non-contracting parties."
"The reality of the situation is that ""vessels from non-contracting parties"" usually means vessels flying flags of convenience or flags obtained from countries which have open registers."
"These are countries which will allow shipowners the right to fly their flag if they pay the country a fee."
"Under international law, it is the responsibility of the state whose flag vessels fly to ensure that they abide by the relevant rules and regulations; for example, conservation measures, safety and labour standards, etc."
"The big problem is that these countries selling flags of convenience have no intention of enforcing these rules, and that is the main reason why they appeal to these unscrupulous shipowners who can do what they like."
"They can flout the law and no one is going to try and enforce it."
"All the shipowner has to do is pay a bit of money to the country to get the flag which will allow him to fish with impunity."
"This really has to stop."
"The list of these countries is very long, but the traditional ones are Belize, Panama, Honduras and St Vincent and the Grenadines."
"Many of these vessels have been active in the NAFO area, but that is not the only place where they operate."
"Very large numbers have also been fishing for tuna in the Atlantic where the regional organisation is ICAT."
"ICAT has done more than any other regional organisation to try and combat fishing by flags of convenience."
"Most dramatically - and this is something that other people should take their lead from - is that it has now imposed import bans on bluefish tuna from one of its own members, Equatorial Guinea."
"ICAT really does mean business and other people should follow suit."
"Organisations like ICAT and NAFO cannot solve the problem on their own."
"The responsibility lies in many other quarters and this responsibility needs to be taken seriously."
"Many shipowners like to use flags of convenience for it lets them get away with just about anything."
"There is no way of enforcing the law."
"The countries that sell allow them to fly their flags; they turn a blind eye and do not care."
"This is why it is so popular."
"The EU is among the worst in this sense."
"According to Lloyd's Maritime Services, in December 1999 there were 1,323 vessels over 24 metres flying flags of convenience."
"Of these, 168 were owned by companies based in EU Member States."
"By far the worst, of course, and not surprising, is Spain with 116 vessels, but of course they are not alone."
"Each country tends to have their preferred flag use."
"For instance, the French vessels tend to use flags of Réunion, St Vincent and the Seychelles."
"For Greece it is Cyprus and Panama."
"The Dutch use Belize and St Vincent and 4 vessels, of course, from my own country are flagged in Belize as well."
"The preferred British countries are Panama and Belize."
"It is not surprising that Belize is there, considering last year' s revelations about Michael Ashcroft, the Tory Party treasurer' s business connections there."
"The Spanish fleet is distributed across a very long list including Belize, Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, Panama and many others."
"The only place which has more of these flags of convenience is Taiwan, with 117, which just beats Spain into first place."
"Last year, the Commission was actually trying to do something; it proposed refusing to grant subsidies for transferring ship ownership to countries with open registers."
"The Council refused."
"It wants to use public money to fund ways of breaking the rules, and that is not acceptable."
"At least one organisation is trying to draw this matter to the public's attention."
"For the past two weeks, Greenpeace has had a ship in the middle of the South Atlantic where they have found plenty of vessels catching tuna, flying these flags of convenience."
"They have also found a transport vessel, flagged in Panama and owned in Japan, both contracting parties to ICAT by the way, which was receiving fish from non-contracting vessels from Belize."
"This is very much against ICAT rules and I really think we have to address it."
"The European Union has to take responsibility on this issue."
"Mr President, I too should like to welcome this proposal for a regulation from the Commission which improves upon certain control measures within NAFO."
"I have often voiced my opinion that NAFO fishing grounds are undoubtedly among the most regulated in the world. Such vigilance is sometimes the result of excessive mistrust, on the part of some Contracting Parties - who have almost unlimited power in NAFO - towards other parties who operate completely legitimately."
"We all remember the unjust and regrettable incidents that took place a few years ago, regarding a Community vessel. These incidents were the product of suspicion bordering on persecution which has often concealed a desire to throw a smoke screen around management errors in some coastal states."
"This is why I must applaud the fact that this proposal aims at incorporating into Community legislation three NAFO recommendations on controlling activities of vessels of non-Contracting Parties, and in particular non-Contracting Parties whose activities are, without a shadow of a doubt, much more suspect than those of any Community fleet."
"As is usual procedure when discussing the transposition of measures into Community law, I must once again express my disappointment over the Commission' s delay in starting to work on adapting legislation."
"If it is indeed true that the proposal covers NAFO' s latest recommendations on sightings and transhipments from its annual meetings in 1998 and 1999, it is also true to say that this represents nothing more than a reworking of the 1997 recommendation, which is only now being taken into account."
"Besides this now traditional complaint, this proposal for a regulation represents an opportunity to debate the real problem of flags of convenience and discuss what the European Union is doing to deal with them."
"Given the current state of marine resources, and at a time when there is growing awareness of the need for real protection of marine ecosystems, the fight against illegal fishing must become a priority and vessels flying flags of convenience should be first on the list."
"The European Union is responsible for taking the lead in the fight against such harmful forms of fishing and must be capable of putting forward its own alternatives."
"The first step must be to propose unified and clear measures in the fight against such activity to Member States. The aim of such common rules is to ban the flying of such flags and stop Member States allowing these fleets to dock in their ports."
"Currently, not all Community ports are aware that, directly or indirectly, they are often providing cover for illegal activity."
"We can only develop their awareness through an information campaign and by introducing rigorous measures to accompany it."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on the amount of work he has put into this, indeed into all issues that come before the Committee on Fisheries."
"The whole question of what we do to protect marine life outside our waters is not a very popular issue."
"It does not exercise the public mind an awful lot in the European Union."
"There is a growing understanding of the efforts that the European Union is making, and I would say that for the many years during which the Common Fisheries Policy has existed, the Union has failed, to a large extent, to convince the European public of the importance of the role it has been playing in trying to establish the facts of marine life, to provide the public with the scientific information and to take the necessary action."
"Too often we do not get the sort of support from Member States and from national governments that is needed to convince the public that determined and substantial efforts have to be made to enforce all the laws and regulations."
"In spite of these efforts, something like 80% of all the major stocks are still over-exploited and continue to diminish."
"The measures before us may be the best that we can manage, but they seem rather weak and hardly sufficient to achieve what we want."
"We are the biggest market and the most lucrative market in the world for fish products."
"We should be prepared to use our muscle and impose every necessary trade sanction on all the states and all the products that are associated with this illegal trade."
"It is not just a matter of protecting our interests, because stocks outside our 200-mile limit can be affected by our activities."
"Stocks within our limit can be affected by activities outside it."
"There is also the whole question of our obligation to protect this resource that belongs to mankind."
"I believe that for some people who have the money to buy large ships and equip them in today's world there is no limit to the capacity that can be applied to extracting resources from the sea."
"I do not think that individuals should have the right, just because they have the money and capacity and because they happen to live in a certain region, to go out and exploit those resources and become very rich as has happened in some instances."
"We may be reaching the point where this resource is tendered and paid for and the public can get some compensation from those who get rich very quickly - they are already doing this in New Zealand."
"The European Union in its review of the Common Fisheries Policy should take into account the fact that this is a public resource and that a small number of people think they have the right to go out and get rich from it."
"There would be widespread public support for some sort of system that requires compensation."
"In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are, to get them, and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that."
"I would like to express my sincere thanks for the interest you have shown in the proposal for the Council regulation in question."
"As you know, the aim of the regulation is to implement at Community level a very important NAFO scheme intended to counteract non-contracting party activities which risk undermining the effectiveness of NAFO conservation measures."
"In this context, I should stress that the Community, as a contracting party to NAFO, has every interest in measures that help to resolve problems caused by states which do not discharge their cooperation and conservation obligations under international law."
"In respect of the proposed amendments, I should stress the following. Amendment No 1 does not seem to be necessary."
"In fact, recital 3 of the version proposed by the Commission is correct because we are actually dealing with the practice of using non-contracting party vessels."
"What is more, this wording is drawn from the language used in other legal texts, for instance the Council decision concerning the approval by the Community of the FAO compliance agreement and the Council regulation laying down certain control measures in respect of vessels flying the flag of non-contracting parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources."
"Amendment No 2 is relevant and will be taken on board."
"Amendment No 3 is not acceptable to the Commission."
"There is no need to impose an obligation on individual vessels."
"If it merely involves spelling out a faculty for individual vessels, there is no need to regulate."
"Furthermore, the terms ""proceed to a formal sighting"" can be construed as an obligation for the Community inspection vessel to direct itself towards non-contracting party vessels in order to make a sighting formal."
"Such an obligation would divert the inspection vessel from the performance of its existing tasks, which is certainly not acceptable."
"I hope that what I have had to say has contributed to a better understanding and thank you again for the time and effort you have put into this proposal."
"The debate is closed."
"I have been up in my room just now, and it is little surprising that Fridays are so devalued."
"The television technicians have gone home, so the television pictures are of the Assembly and no longer of the original speakers."
"The staff are apparently running for the exits from 9 a.m. on Friday mornings, so it is hardly surprising that Fridays are being devalued."
"I would ask you to check that the whole service of Parliament is available so long as the House is sitting."
"I will pass on your comments to the Bureau but as regards the TV system we have considered this question before."
"During the last Parliament, when Mr Gutierrez traditionally took the chair on Fridays, he asked for full television coverage of the sitting."
"We tried this for a period of six months and no television network ever took any of the broadcasts and so the practice was discontinued as it was extremely expensive."
"I do not wish to embark on a discussion of this issue now but you can rest assured I will pass on your remarks to the Bureau."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE"
"I would like to congratulate Mr Varela on his report on vessels flying non-Community flags that are non-contracting parties to NAFO, which was adopted unanimously."
"As Ms McKenna rightly said, the use of flags of convenience makes it possible to flout all the regulations."
"My father had a bar in Genoa next to the Panama consulate - and I am not criticising the Panama consulate or any other consulate, for that matter - and I am therefore very aware that laws are violated."
"For example, people who did not know how to swim or row were allowed to set sail, for only a passport was required, not a seaman' s book."
"We will be staffing ships with sailors who do not know how to swim, next."
"Protection of juveniles of marine organisms"
"The next item is the report (A5-0103/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fifth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (COM(1999) 570 - C5-0041/2000 - 1999/023(CNS))"
"Mr President, Commissioner, before I begin my speech, I should like to highlight the unanimity in this House over the previous report so that the Commission reflects upon the reasons underlying the amendments we have tabled."
"I hope that such unanimity leads them to reconsider their position on these two amendments that you said you would not adopt."
"In any event, regarding the report we are currently debating, I should like to point out that the specific aim of these technical measures is to protect juveniles of marine organisms in order to reduce the threat to future yields."
"As a result, alongside the Commission, we are aiming and endeavouring to protect fishery resources."
"As you know, such measures include rules on the size of fishing gear, - and of meshes in particular - minimum allowable landing sizes, specific closed areas, protection of endangered species and so on."
"The governing Regulation No 850/98 entered into force on 1 January of this year, but it must obviously continue to be periodically adapted to incorporate any new data and scientific innovations which may emerge."
"In the case we are currently dealing with, we are discussing the fifth amendment which will enable the Commission to include various new measures that, in our opinion, are fully justified."
"We are talking about nets for shrimp fishing, closed areas for fishing for sand eels and a review of the minimum size for certain bivalve molluscs and crustacea."
"The Commission' s proposed revisions and additions to Annex XII appear to be reasonable."
"However, in the newly added case of deepwater rose shrimp, the carapace length of 24 millimetres seems excessive and could cause problems for fishermen. As a result, your rapporteur has introduced an amendment, which has already been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, suggesting a compromise of setting this restriction at 22 millimetres."
"This compromise, of course, has already been agreed with the Member States as being more appropriate."
"We also feel that reducing the size of carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres, which has been widely called for by the sector, is a very positive step."
"Therefore, it is now a question of adapting certain measures that will have a positive impact on economic and social spheres whilst strictly respecting scientific reports."
"To sum up, it is essential that this regulation is kept up to date and that it is based on the best available scientific recommendations."
"This will not be the last amendment made given that there will be a continuing need to adapt to specific conditions and to scientific reports that emerge in the future."
"For this reason, with this amendment - which I think should be taken into consideration - we accept the overall proposal from the Commission and I hope that the Commission will in turn accept our amendment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you can see, we are dealing thoroughly with the conservation of the fish population."
"A short while ago, we were still dealing with measures within the sphere of NAFO. We will now depart from the subject of offshore fishing in the ocean and go into detail on fishing in EU waters."
"It is not always just whales and seals which the public wants protected, and which attract, without doubt, greater attention from them."
"No, we must also direct our attention now and then to less popular species which do not look as cute."
"Who as a child has ever taken a carpetshell (venerupis polastra) in his arms as he would a soft toy?"
"We certainly have a heart for children, but nothing concerns us quite so much as whether the juvenile fish are thriving."
"We are therefore always prepared to take the necessary measures to protect them."
"We must protect the periphyton of marine organisms now in order to preserve all species."
"The regulation which we are dealing with is not a new one."
"In fact, it is being amended again today for the fifth time."
"In view of the developing populations, however, it must be amended time and time again in accordance with the requirements at a particular moment in time."
"The mechanisms are improved, and new minimum sizes and fishing methods to protect species are established, as is deemed necessary by the fisherman on the spot."
"In the end it is the theoretical expert who must give way to practice."
"We do not have any objections to the amendments which the Commission is proposing, right down to the last detail."
"They represent the latest technical and scientific developments."
"I think the Commission likes to hear this, and it is also therefore appropriate to emphasise the work done by the experts dealing with this in the Commission."
"Ultimately, Parliament has no interest in branding the Commission as its general scapegoat."
"On the contrary, I would like to use this report to show that things can also be done differently."
"The Committee on Fisheries is particularly benefiting from positive cooperation with the Commission and its services."
"This cooperation is imperative for the preservation of sea populations."
"Who, apart from the Commission, should monitor them and protect this natural resource?"
"It is not always possible to fall back on artificially bred substitutes, which furthermore have been genetically manipulated wherever possible."
"Does it sound healthy to you, for instance, when I say that it is possible to breed super salmon which grow eight times faster than before?"
"Quantity instead of quality?"
"The awareness that we need to do something to preserve a healthy variety of food and the willingness to take appropriate action are the needs of the moment."
"We cannot go onto a fishing ground like the Huns, destroy it, and then simply move with the caravan onto the next one without taking responsibility for what is left behind."
"If the matter is worth something to us, economically as well as ecologically, we must also take appropriate action on our own doorstep and not just in the North-West Atlantic."
"These measures are a step in the right direction."
"I do not think that tourists, on boat trips in the future, will be able to watch sand eels as well as seals being reared, but maybe, in a few years' time, we will once again be able to say, with a clear conscience, that we can fish for this species because its preservation is guaranteed."
"Mr President, we are now discussing the fifth amendment in two years to the regulation on technical measures for the conservation of juveniles of marine organisms."
"This is a report of a technical nature which is of no interest whatsoever to the majority of MEPs."
"However, perhaps their attitude would change a little if we were to explain exactly what it is about and how a report of this type can impact on the lives of the peoples of Europe."
"For this reason, Commissioner, I shall refer specifically to the carpetshell, which is mentioned in paragraph 4. I shall refer to carpetshells as I am delighted that the Commission has reduced the minimum size for selling carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres."
"Ladies and gentleman, this is a matter of 2 millimetres of carpetshell."
"These millimetres are important because when the landing size was increased to the current 40 millimetres, this caused serious problems for women who harvest shellfish in my region, Galicia, as it did for the whole marketing sector and for consumers themselves."
"In Galicia, shellfish gathering on foot - and this is how carpetshells are collected - is only done by women."
"It would take a long and complicated explanation to say why."
"The fact is that men gather shellfish at sea and using technology, albeit basic, and women gather shellfish on foot using a hoe."
"Approximately 10 000 women in Galicia extract carpetshells, as shellfish are not fished but rather extracted."
"These women work in a self-sacrificing way, working long days digging up hectares and hectares of beach in very difficult conditions for very low incomes. These women then see their income dwindle away as more than half their annual income is consumed by social security contributions."
"Evidence seems to contradict any research the Commission used to increase the minimum landing size of these molluscs as, from 30-32 millimetres upwards, the carpetshell is mature and can reproduce."
"Environmental conditions in densely populated areas where the carpetshell breeds and reproduces, such as in the estuaries of Galicia, do not allow them to reach the 40 millimetres required by the regulation which we are going to change today."
"The truth is that 80% of naturally produced carpetshells fall short of the current size requirement."
"If shellfish gatherers were to wait for carpetshells to reach this size, mortality would be considerable and such loss would be due to environmental conditions and not to the women' s actions."
"In places where molluscs are most abundant - and I am thinking of the Ferrol and Arosa estuaries - the size of carpetshells does not exceed 36 or 38 millimetres."
"Carpetshells measuring 40 millimetres are neither produced, sold nor consumed, simply because there are none."
"If we wish to avoid encouraging non-compliance, one of the tasks of this or any other Parliament is to ensure that the rules reflect real conditions. In the case of harvesting shellfish on foot, such non-compliance leads to illegal fishing and to a black market subject to no health checks."
"This House must realise that, by drawing up these technical measures, we are trying to protect juveniles, by allowing them to reach a certain size and breeding age, whilst at the same time trying to reduce unnecessary yields."
"But for a regulation to fulfil its purpose, it must be adapted to real conditions."
"As a result, not only will we benefit hard-working Galician shellfish gatherers but we will also benefit consumers as they will have access to a product that has passed all health checks. We will also encourage traders who will cease to feel persecuted by legislation that, if it were fully complied with, would lead to a shortage on the markets."
"For this reason, the Group of the Party of European Socialists - which I represent - supports the proposed amendment to this regulation, in the same way as it supports the amendment from the Committee on Fisheries on the size of deepwater rose shrimp."
"The only thing we hope, Commissioner, is that we do not have to review the regulation again within a year, because this would mean that both we and the European Commission had once again made a mistake in our calculations."
"But, if need be, we will be here to amend it once again."
"Mr President, I should like to express our support for Mr Varela' s report and, at the same time, thank the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries for being so cooperative in the Committee."
"Technical measures in order, especially, to protect juvenile fish- and thus secure the quantities which can be fished in the future - may be necessary."
"Up until now, measures have consisted of reductions in quotas, minimum mesh sizes for nets and fishing bans in certain periods."
"It stands to reason that such measures and arrangements should be modified in the light of new needs and knowledge."
"What is new is that the fisheries in which sand eel are caught off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland are to become protected areas."
"The reason for this is the low breeding rate of the kittiwake in recent years."
"Denmark is the Member State which will be most affected by this limitation, which will reduce many fishermen' s potential catches and, in that way, affect their livelihood."
"As a matter of form, I would point out that Denmark has agreed to this technical measure for a limited period."
"I should like to ask the Commission if the fishermen have been compensated for their losses or been directed to other likely fishing grounds."
"Because bird colonies are affected by many factors in addition to fishing, I wish to propose that the Committee on Fisheries be included in future discussions about closures or limitations on quotas against the background of what is happening on land."
"What I want is for us to have the opportunity to look in depth at the different factors of relevance to bird colonies and, in that connection, to discuss the bird colonies' influence on catch sizes in relation to the principle set out under the common fisheries policy whereby the fishing industry is to be safeguarded through the optimum exploitation of marine resources."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on today's fisheries reports, both of which I am sure will receive the overwhelming acceptance of this House and both of which are extremely important in terms of protection and conservation of fishery resources."
"I welcome the Commission's updating of the regulation on the protection of juveniles."
"We all know that sustainable development is a learning process and we must be able to update and adapt existing legislation to protect our fish stocks."
"I have paid particular attention to scientific advice which indicates the requirement for the closure of fisheries for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland."
"This does not just concern the maintenance of sand eel stocks themselves, but the preservation of the entire ecosystem in these localities."
"The low breeding rate of the kittiwake that Mr Busk referred to is of particular concern."
"I am also happy to note, as Mr Busk confirmed, that Denmark as a Member State principally concerned with sand eel fishery has accepted these measures."
"However, while these measures will hopefully contribute to improving the state of fishery resources, I am concerned that the Commission has not got it right in certain other areas: for example, in the recent report on the implementation of MAGPs and the drastic cuts that it calls for in some fleets which is of grave concern to Scots and other fishermen."
"I would like to ask the Commission if they have really looked at whether cutting fleet sizes actually improves the conservation of fisheries."
"I quote from the Commission's own document which says: ""The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries found no evidence that stocks had, in general, deteriorated or improved since the adoption of MAGP4."""
"Surely we must question the effectiveness of MAGPs as a conservation measure."
"The Commission also failed to take into account how fleet sizes are reduced."
"I call for a more thorough investigation by the Commission into this."
"In those states which have, on paper at least, been complying with MAGPs such as Spain and Portugal, what has happened to the vessels which are removed from the register?"
"How many would be decommissioned?"
"How many were scrapped?"
"How many were sunk and so on?"
"How many were simply transferred to another flag?"
"How many vessels continue to fish either here in the Community or elsewhere under what is, in many cases, a flag of convenience?"
"The Commission must get conservation measures right, but I am not convinced that MAGPs are the way to do that."
"They can be circumvented easily and they do not fully take into account national measures such as days at sea."
"How can the Commission reconcile this with the fact that its own report says, and I quote again: ""It could be argued that a reduction in activity would have a more direct impact on the exploitation rates than a reduction in capacity."""
"I hope that the Commission will review its position and not impose swingeing cuts on our fleets."
"In Scotland, the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas."
"The new proposals to cut fleets will, ironically, fall mainly on the Scottish pelagic fleet where MAGP targets have actually been met through control measures."
"I welcome today's reports on this agenda, but I hope the Commission will think again when it comes to the interrelation between fleet sizes and other conservation measures."
"We have got to get this right so that in the long run fish stocks in Europe are conserved, thereby ensuring the continuing viability of our fisheries communities."
"Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude for the fact that my suggestions were taken into account when this report was drawn up and, in particular, the recommendation that the size of deepwater rose shrimps be set at 22 millimetres rather than at the 24 millimetres proposed by the Commission."
"Although I think that the Commission' s proposal is not unreasonable, we have to bear in mind that the size limit is being set for the first time and that this species is an important part of the catches of certain fleets in southern Spain and Portugal where, until now, they have been fishing for shrimps without any size restrictions."
"In a species that does not grow very large, 2 millimetres is a great deal when trying to determine whether the profitability of some very small-scale fisheries will be increased or decreased. As I said, such fisheries are not used to fishing with minimum size restrictions."
"What is more, Portugal, the other Member State involved, wanted this minimum size to be even smaller. As a result, I feel that the compromise reached is acceptable and to be commended."
"I should like to thank the Commission for being so prepared to listen and to accept both suggestions from this House as well as from the Council, which were along the same lines."
"I am also especially interested in the Commission' s proposal on the temporary halt on sand eel fishing in Scottish and English waters."
"I must also welcome the fact that Denmark, the country most dependent on fisheries, has not raised any major objections to this measure. Their attitude should enable us to progress towards a more realistic management system of fishery resources used for industrial purposes."
"I have often expressed my doubts about the idea that we should maintain large fleets in depleted ecosystems, such as those of the Community, which means that fish stocks are being destroyed in order to produce fish meal or oil."
"In the European Parliament Resolution of June 1998 on this type of fishing, which was based on a report drawn up by Mr Kindermann, it was highlighted that 60% of Community yields in the North Sea, Skagerrat and Kattegat are intended for this type of industrial use."
"Reports from the FAO and environmental organisations estimate that 70% of fisheries production is used to this end and say this is contributing to the destruction of stocks on a worldwide scale."
"Evidently, these figures also highlight the high socio-economic dependency of some Community regions on such activity."
"For this reason, while I have no desire whatsoever to eliminate this activity completely, it may be an opportune moment to debate the possibility of achieving a greater balance, taking account of the various fleets' objectives in the use of resources. Eventually, this new balance should be borne in mind when distributing Community funds for structural measures as well as administrative and market policy measures."
"Mr President, firstly, can I congratulate the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries on his report on the revision of the regulations on the conservation of fishery resources and technical measures for the protection of juvenile marine organisms."
"This report, whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following, the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation."
"Firstly, with regard to separator trawls or nets with sorting grids used in shrimp fisheries; secondly, the revision of minimum sizes for a number of bivalve molluscs and crustaceans; and thirdly, with respect to the establishment of a closed area for fishing for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland."
"It is on the last proposal that I primarily wish to speak."
"This is a very good example of the eco-system approach to fisheries: taking action for environmental reasons beyond those applying strictly for fish stock levels."
"In 1998, a report by the Working Group on Eco-System Effects of Fishing Activities of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas identified for the first time that sea birds, specifically the kittiwake, which has been experiencing low breeding success over recent years, were in fact in competition with the industrial fleet, primarily Danish operators fishing for sand eels off the East coast of Scotland and England."
"The United Kingdom requested the Commission to submit an appropriate proposal in the light of that report and the United Kingdom made initial approaches to the Danish government to encourage their support for the initiative."
"It was suggested that a closed season for sand eel fishing should be introduced between April and August when the breeding birds were most dependent on sand eels for food."
"The ICES subsequently looked at the science again and suggested a closed area stretching from mid-Northumberland northwards to include the Grampian coast."
"This closed area is the one proposed by the Commission in December as part of the annual TAC Regulation and adopted by the Council."
"These measures have, I understand, already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved."
"I therefore hope the Council will be able, after this debate, to reach a speedy agreement."
"It is important for the conservation of sea birds."
"It is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area."
"Mr President, this is an important subject."
"It is highly technical and not easily understood by the public."
"A gradual improvement in the regulations will contribute in the long term to the future health of the marine environment for the generations that will come after us."
"We can improve our resources."
"We are not self-sufficient in fish in the Union, only 50% self-sufficient."
"With good conservation and better practices, we could give a better living to more people involved in fishing."
"We could increase by something like EUR 4 000 million the value of the fish landed in the European Union if we could apply a little bit more care over a period of time to our fishing activities."
"This is highly technical."
"It is important that we do the research, keep up the revision and gradually convince people that the European Commission is not a hostile organisation sent from afar to persecute fishermen and prevent them from making a living."
"We should not use occasions like this to make inflammatory statements about the necessity of reducing the size of fleets that are involved, because of the reduction in stocks, because of the high price of fish arising out of its scarcity in the European Union and the attraction of this type of food for health reasons."
"There is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it."
"People complain about the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme and say it is not working."
"Surely, a transport manager will not want to keep ten buses on the road if one bus will transport the passengers available."
"The same applies to trains or trucks."
"So why do we get this pressure from the fishing communities to maintain large expensive fleets if, in fact, the fish are not there and we are bound by quotas?"
"If the quotas are being observed, surely it is in the interest of the fishing communities of the regions and the individuals involved to go out and catch these fish with the smallest possible number of fishing vessels."
"Surely it contributes more to regional and national economic planning to do that."
"Do not swallow this foolish talk that we want to keep boats and that somehow or other this will keep people in jobs if the fish are not there."
"There were banner headlines just because the Commission published, a few days ago, a report which indicated that some fleets would have to be reduced."
"Those reports spread over from Scotland to Ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed."
"There is no need for it."
"Let us sit down, come to the Fisheries Committee, listen to the officials, listen to the researchers and work out a sensible solution to the problems instead of trying to create an atmosphere of hostility."
"We have one programme broadcast in Ireland that deals with the sea."
"It is called ""Seascapes""."
"The night before we had the Maastricht Referendum, they upped their tone and the temperature of their anti-European broadcasting, which goes on continuously, in an effort to ingratiate themselves with fishing communities who have the impression that somehow or another the European Commission is there to damage their interests."
"Let us, as responsible public representatives, try to present the truth to our people instead of trying to mislead them and excite them and frighten them."
"Mr McCartin appeared with his last remarks to be accusing honourable Members of this House of misleading the public."
"I hope that was not true."
"In case it was, then I suggest that he ought to be supplied with a map of the Scottish fishing areas to see just why it is so important to a lot of places where people can take boats out from."
"Mr McCartin is far too polite to make any such accusation."
"May I thank Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna for this excellent report, he is an acknowledged expert on this subject - and also thank the honourable Members who have spoken on this debate and expressed their thanks for the work of the Commission."
"I am very happy to inform honourable Members that the Commission can agree to the amendments that have been put forward."
"It appears to me to be an excellent example of the cooperation between our two institutions on this important issue of conservation."
"Apart from this, the report fully supports the Commission proposal; and therefore I feel that I need not take up any more of your valuable time."
"That concludes the debate."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) EXPLANATION OF VOTE"
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party I voted for the Varela report."
"It is not the first time that I have intervened on behalf of young fish, but I do so because I would like them to have the chance to grow old and, if possible, become pensioners."
"I have already received satisfied feedback, not only from fish, but also from human pensioners, for it is right to protect the young, even if they are only fish, as is the case here."
"It is true that this could cause problems for a few fishermen who can no longer catch such large numbers of fish, but I am sure that the Commission will find a way to compensate the fishermen whose income will fall as a result of their observance of this directive."
"I would like to thank the House for its patience in listening to my explanations of votes."
"Mr President, I should just like to say that I hope the Conference of Presidents will take serious note of the numbers - or rather lack of numbers - of Members in the Chamber voting on that very important report."
"Mr President, I would like to draw to the attention of Parliament' s administration the fact that the Members' coffee bar has been occupied."
"There are fifteen people there in military uniform who have taken over one end of the coffee bar and are holding some kind of meeting there."
"I should like Parliament' s administration to take immediate steps to put an end to this occupation, so that Members can have the use of both ends of their coffee bar."
"You are right, the Members Bar is only for the use of Members."
"We will ensure that is enforced."
"This matter has already been drawn to the attention of the Quaestors."
"Insurance"
"The next item is the report (A5-0104/2000) by Mr Langen on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the operation of Commission Regulation No 3932/92 concerning the application of Article 81 (ex-Article 85), Paragraph 3, of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements, decisions and concerted practices in the field of insurance (COM(1999) 192 - C5.0254/1999 - 1999/2183(COS))"
"Mr President, this time the subject at the close of the sitting is not fisheries, but competition policy."
"We have discussed this subject in great depth. It has not been too controversial, so it is also possible to discuss it at the end of such a sitting."
"Since I am often here on Fridays anyway, I personally do not find this at all difficult."
"The subject is exemption regulations, which are in force for the European insurance industry."
"You all know that competition law has been one of the most important objectives of the European Union - and therefore of the European Commission - since the founding Treaties came into existence."
"The general aim of competition law is to ensure that there is competition in the European Internal Market."
"This serves consumers, promotes technical progress, and prevents monopolies and agreements."
"Therefore, the rules on this are strict."
"The Commission can and must take action in accordance with the rules, which have three different spheres of application: agreements or cartel agreements which are generally prohibited, abuse of a dominant market position, and public subsidies."
"Over the past few years, the Commission, on all these issues, has repeatedly shown that it takes the provisions of the Treaties very seriously."
"We will deal with the first of these areas today."
"The general prohibition of cartel agreements is lifted under certain conditions; these are the exemption regulations."
"Price fixing, restrictions on, or control of, production, dividing up markets, application of different prerequisites for the same services and the extra provisions of the Treaties, which often vary tremendously in Europe and exclude different services, are incompatible with the laws, even in the areas where exemption regulations apply."
"Under Article 81(3), exemption regulations only apply - please listen carefully - when consumers receive an appropriate share of the benefit generated and no unnecessary restrictions ruling out competition are imposed."
"A regulation of this kind has existed in the field of insurance since 1992, and expires in 2003."
"The Commission is required to submit a situation report every six years. The present report is available."
"The Block Exemption Regulation for the insurance industry lays down and permits common rules governing agreement on the calculation of premiums, the stipulation of policy conditions, joint coverage of certain types of risk, and safety precautions."
"To date, agreements on claims settlement and registers of aggravated risks have not been included."
"I hope that when the Rothley report on the harmonisation of civil liability insurance in respect of the use of motor vehicles is adopted after the third reading on Monday, the Commission can, and will, also incorporate - on account of the harmonised legal basis - the settlement of claims into this future exemption regulation."
"It will then be much easier for European Union citizens, in future, to be able to settle claims abroad, including in EU Member States, with their own insurers, safe in the knowledge that these agreements are also then guaranteed by the Commission within the framework of the exemption regulation."
"Parliament has made unanimous demands on the Commission in its proposal. These should be taken into consideration by the Commission when examining the proposal."
"This concerns, firstly, the definition of market share in a globalised market, followed by detailed questions about the lead insurer, for whom this might not apply."
"When there is one large and 20 small insurers, then the large one may not have more than 10 per cent of the market share for the exemption agreement to be accepted."
"Whether this is correct or not is doubtful."
"This concerns matters which are connected with the possibility of termination."
"We want the notice period for an insurance company to be 6 months and not 12, and we want to bring about a harmonised basis for European standards in the settlement of claims."
"All in all, I can say that Parliament is satisfied with this interim report and that it expects the Commission to make continuous progress on this matter and achieve an end result for the insurance industry within the framework of the exemption regulations in force, all of which expire in 2002 and 2003, including for other areas."
"With this in mind, I would urge you to give your assent. Thank you very much."
"Affairs and the Internal Market. I would particularly like to express my own gratitude to Mr Langen for his report and for the great clarity with which, in writing and in his presentation today, he has brought to our attention what this is all about."
"I am glad to say that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is in substantial agreement with Mr Langen and finds no legal obstacles to this bloc exemption regulation."
"As Members of the House will know, the bloc exemption creates exemptions from normal competition law, of the kind Mr Langen mentioned, in relation to the calculation of premiums where net premiums may be jointly calculated by insurers."
"Secondly, in the establishment of standard policy conditions for direct insurance and common models illustrating profits from insurance policies involving an element of capitalisation."
"It also creates an exemption to make possible co-insurance, common coverage of certain risks and, finally, the coordination of technical specifications for safety equipment and procedures."
"The Commission says in its report that it is disappointed that the insurance industry has not taken up as much of that as it might have done."
"These are all areas where it seems clear that there is a genuine public interest in not insisting on the strictest rigours of competition law."
"What that draws to our attention, in a philosophical way, is that even in a competitive market, insurance is inherently a collective activity in which people share risks among themselves."
"If I might make a remark about a currently controversial topic in my own country, I think it is a pity to see such vigorous efforts being made to de-mutualise excellent old mutual assurance companies which fully express the collective aspect of insurance, and I am sad to think of a raid being made on the Standard Life in this way."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Langen, and all those who have contributed to this draft resolution on the Commission's report on the operation of the insurance block exemption regulation."
"The Commission welcomes the draft resolution, not only for its overall support concerning the Commission's application of the regulation, but also for the specific comments which it contains on how the regulation can be improved."
"A brief word of background about the regulation in question is perhaps in order."
"Before 1992, the competition directorate-general of the Commission was submerged by literally hundreds of notifications of agreements in the insurance field, many of which raised similar issues and were eligible for an exemption under Article 81(3) of the Treaty."
"Rather than adopting hundreds of individual exemption decisions, the Commission adopted in 1992 a block exemption regulation granting exemption, with conditions, to agreements between insurance undertakings in four categories: agreements concerning the joint calculation of risk premiums, those concerning standard policy conditions, co-insurance and reinsurance, pooling arrangements and agreements adopting standards for safety equipment."
"The Council Regulation of 1991 enabling the Commission to adopt an insurance block exemption regulation also authorised the inclusion of two further areas which the Commission, however, decided not to include in its regulation for lack of experience in those areas, namely agreements on claims settlement and agreements on registers of aggravated risk."
"Following the adoption of the Block Exemption Regulation in 1992, most of the notifications on the Commission's table were withdrawn, but some were not, as the notifying parties considered that the regulation did not provide total clarity as to whether their agreements were eligible for exemption."
"Most of these notifications concerned insurance pools."
"The current regulation expires on 31 March 2003 and a new regulation will be necessary."
"The future regulation should build on these strengths and remedy any weaknesses in the existing one."
"The report produced by the Commission on 12 May 1999, which it was pursuant to Article 8 of the Council enabling regulation, was the first step in the process leading to the adoption of a new regulation."
"It summarises in detail the experience of the Commission in applying the regulation and the various problems it has identified."
"It does not, however, contain precise proposals for the future regulation."
"These will only be decided upon after the end of the consultation process."
"Considerable account will be taken of Parliament's resolution in this process."
"Other interested parties, including professional insurance bodies and consumer organisations, will also be consulted."
"The next step in the consultation will be a hearing organised by the Commission on 28 June of this year for an exchange of views between all those who have submitted comments on the report on the regulation."
"This hearing responds in part to the call in the draft resolution for an informative debate on the regulation."
"It is clear that the area in which most improvement to the regulation is needed is that of pools."
"Significant change will be necessary here, but key questions exist in all the other areas."
"The comments and suggestions contained in the draft resolution, for which I thank Parliament, are all relevant and interesting in this context, although each of them will have to be analysed individually and on its merits."
"May I just respond at this stage to two issues of a similar nature raised by both Mr Langen and Mr Meijer, and that is the question whether the Commission accepts the draft opinion's recommendation that agreements on claims settlement should be included in the future block exemption regulation."
"The Commission has an open mind at this stage as to whether agreements on claim settlement and agreements on registers of aggravated risks should be covered by the future regulation."
"It takes good note of the fact that the draft opinion recommends the inclusion of agreements and on claims settlement."
"The conclusion of the draft resolution that the regulation has been successful overall, but that a moderate enhancement is needed, is one that the Commission entirely shares."
"The draft resolution is a most helpful contribution to this end and the Commission will keep Parliament fully informed and consulted on the process of revising the regulation."
"Mr President, I have, of course, voted for Mr Langen' s excellent report, and I congratulate him on his work and also on his report."
"Both the public and ourselves are obviously pleased with the simplifications he has explained so clearly."
"I would like for this to be the case in other areas as well."
"You know that I am a great advocate of Parliament' s seat in Strasbourg and I have also regretted all the fuss again made this morning by those who wanted to prevent us from voting today, because they simply want to ruin the Friday sittings in Strasbourg and for everything to be concentrated in Brussels. And these centralists are also, of course, setting their sights on Luxembourg - as a by-product so to speak - for Parliament' s Secretariat."
"Certainly, I must also say that this does not always make things easy for France to defend Strasbourg as a parliamentary seat."
"One of my groups of visitors found this out again on their way here this morning."
"Their bus was stopped by the French police under the pretext that the driver would not have a French driving licence."
"This particular company has transported thousands of my visitors here in the past ten years."
"What is going on here then?"
"I must say that these visitors wonder, naturally, whether this is what Europe is all about."
"Moreover, the French police do not seem to have heard of credit cards yet."
"The visitors had to pool their French francs together to pay the horrendous FRF 5 000 fine."
"This cannot be right, Mr President!"
"I will, of course, check ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I am afraid I must cut you off, Mrs Lulling."
"Explanations of vote must refer to the subject of the debate."
"I gave you some leeway as you are such a distinguished Member of the House but I must cut you off there."
"Mr President, last Sunday in Bergamo, my native town, I held a meeting on insurance and compensation for damages, which Mr Langen discussed in his report."
"A young 20-year old, who had, sadly, suffered a serious road accident, rose to his feet and said: ""I have suffered this serious road accident but I am, so to speak, content because I have received EUR 500 000 from the insurance company"" ."
"Another person present at the meeting, who was about 40 years of age, said: ""I suffered exactly the same road accident, but I only received EUR 200 000."
"""An older man who was about 60 added: ""I only received EUR 20 000"" ."
"Another man who was about 70 years old said: ""I suffered the same accident with the same results, and I was given EUR 1 000"" ."
"An elderly 80-year old pensioner, who could not even get out of his chair because he was so disabled, said: ""I did not receive anything at all from the insurance"" ."
"Insurance companies consider that the elderly are worthless."
"But I say that the elderly are worth more."
"I therefore call for measures to be included in the regulation that will put a stop to this injustice."
"Mr President, I just wanted to ask one question."
"I did not notice Mrs Buitenweg this morning and I would like to apologise to her for that."
"I just wanted to ask whether Mrs van der Laan is here or have I missed her as well?"
"I will take that as an interesting intervention."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting closed at 11.30 a.m.)"
"Before we start with the order of business, there are still a number of points of order."
"Mr President, with regret I have to inform the House of the arrest yesterday in Moscow of Vladimir Alexandrovich Gusinsky, chief executive of the Most-Media group of television, radio and newspaper outlets."
"Mr Gusinsky is a leading Russian community leader, being chairman of the Russian Jewish Congress and deputy chairman of the World Jewish Congress."
"This morning he is in what is known as a general purpose cell in Butyrsky prison where conditions are such that they must be left to your imagination."
"Mr Gusinsky's media activities were the only ones permitted to criticise Mr Putin and his government."
"His independent television is the only one that questions the behaviour of Russian troops in Chechnya."
"His programme Dolls, based on Britain's Spitting Image, satirises the President, something which supposedly causes him great irritation."
"His radio station Moscow Echo was selected by President Clinton a few days ago for the only substantive interview that he gave to a Russian outlet."
"On 11 May Mr Gusinsky's places of work were raided by so-called tax police - men in ski masks and camouflage outfits carrying Kalashnikov rifles."
"There are few Russians who do not see a connection between Gusinsky's criticisms and the heavy-handed treatment now being meted out to him."
"Now we have this arrest and Mr Putin says he knows nothing about it."
"This latest event leaves Russia teetering on the brink."
"Either Mr Putin backs down and releases Mr Gusinsky, or we shall have to conclude that Russia's brave attempt to establish a free press has turned out a failure and their democracy an illusion."
"The consequences of this will be devastating."
"It will mean goodbye Council of Europe, goodbye Partnership for Peace, farewell Tacis and a warm welcome to a new arms race."
"The European Parliament must do what it can to avert this catastrophe."
"I ask you, Mr President, to confer with your colleagues so that the whole range of EU-Russia relations can be investigated, debated and our influence brought to bear not least on the turbulent Mr Putin, who is putting us all in danger."
"Thank you."
"As you can hear from the applause, the House has taken note of your comment."
"- (NL) Mr President, I would like to bring up another point."
"Not only yesterday, but also a few months ago, every month really, permits are granted to the presidency or other nationalities to organise receptions."
"These then degenerate into all-out bingeing sessions, at which point the cameras start to roll."
"I think, Mr President, that that is unworthy of Parliament."
"What I would like to ask through you is that these kinds of festivity be regulated properly."
"I think that we can no longer afford this kind of behaviour."
"I am surprised that permission is granted for this kind of thing, because my request to set up an exhibition for the handicapped, organised by myself, was turned down last week by the same College of Quaestors."
"My request was looked upon critically, whereas these kinds of party, where we are portrayed as vultures, are simply tolerated."
"I would ask you to raise this matter with the College of Quaestors in order to put a stop to this, as this is beneath us all."
"Madam, please be so kind as to file your concern in writing with the Quaestors, who will then take the necessary steps."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have been studying yesterday' s Minutes and I have noted that Elmar Brok, MEP, has not mentioned that there might be grounds for his disqualification when voting on the report on digital television, although he has indicated in the register containing information on Members' secondary occupations that he is senior vice-president in a company called 'Media Developments Bertelsmann' ."
"In my opinion, this matter should be discussed in Parliament."
"I have not quite understood the honourable member."
"Are you saying that he did or did not vote?"
"According to the translation, he did not vote and if he did not vote on a matter which is pertinent, then he behaved correctly."
"Mr President, I have been reading the Minutes and it does not say here that he would not have voted."
"We shall clarify the matter."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Mr President, I have taken the floor simply to tell you that I have been in contact with Mr Murphy, the rapporteur of this report, and we have agreed that it would be better to proceed to the vote without debating the report."
"What you have suggested is most unusual, because normally this is decided when the order of business is adopted."
"If reports have been entered on the order of business with a debate then, having consulted the Rules of Procedure, I see no way of removing them from the order of business."
"I suggest that we keep to the chosen procedure with debate."
"I now have another statement to make."
"Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to ..."
"(Interruption by Mr Brok)"
"Mr Brok, we have moved on to another point."
"If it is about what the honourable member said earlier, I shall gladly give you the floor afterwards so that you can make a personal statement."
"Now if you would be so kind as to take your seat, that would ease the tension somewhat."
"Yesterday Mr Lannoye moved to table the motion by 185 members to set up a temporary committee of inquiry into ECHELON in accordance with Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, which was rejected by a majority at the Conference of Presidents' meeting on 13 April, for a resolution by Parliament."
"The President has informed me that the Conference of Presidents is due to discuss the question of setting up a temporary committee again tomorrow."
"I am sure the honourable member agrees that it makes sense to wait for the results of this discussion before tabling the matter before plenary."
"It makes no material difference, a vote will he held anyway, the question is merely whether it will be during this plenary session or the next."
"Mr President, I do not know if the problem lies in the wording, but this does not appear to answer the question I was asking."
"In fact, on tomorrow' s agenda, the Conference of Presidents has tabled its proposal for the establishment of a temporary committee, not a committee of inquiry."
"This, however, is not the issue: what I am asking for is a vote on the decision by the Conference of Presidents, with the motion that there should not be a committee of inquiry."
"There is another motion, but that is not it."
"You have therefore not answered my question."
"I believe I have because, as far as the procedure is concerned, we have two options."
"First, we can vote separately on the question of setting up a temporary committee and the question of setting up a committee of inquiry."
"We can do that separately and at different times."
"But the Rules of Procedure do not require us to proceed in this way."
"The motion, therefore, is to vote on both questions jointly as a package and that is our second option."
"I cannot see that it will prejudice the idea of a committee of inquiry, which is what you want, if we merge the votes and the whole issue takes another three weeks."
"It makes no material difference; at some point the House will have to state its view."
"I repeat: it would be possible, but the President suggests that we proceed differently and I suggest likewise to you now."
"Mr President, I think that it is quite reasonable to propose two votes at the same time, but I insist that there should be two votes: firstly, a vote on the principle of establishing a committee of inquiry, which was rejected by the Conference of Presidents, and there may have to be a second vote if agreement is reached on establishing a temporary committee, which, I must point out, serves a quite different purpose."
"These are two different problems and a close look at the Rules of Procedure will show that Rule 151 does not provide for a temporary committee: it only mentions a committee of inquiry."
"I feel that the plenary is within its rights to state its opinion on the position adopted by the Conference of Presidents."
"Mr Lannoye, that goes without saying!"
"The Rules of Procedure are crystal clear: if the requisite number of signatures is collected, then a vote must be held in plenary following the decision of the Conference of Presidents, otherwise it would mean that the Conference of Presidents decides whether or not to set up a committee of inquiry rather than plenary."
"And, of course, that is not how it works."
"There may be one or two people in the Conference of Presidents who believe that it is, but they are labouring under a misapprehension!"
"(Heckling, interjection by Mr Poettering)) Mr Poettering says no-one believes that and so your problem is solved!"
"Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to support the request and I am satisfied with your response."
"At last, tomorrow afternoon, the Conference will give a response to this request which has been signed by so many Members."
"I have taken note of the honourable member' s comment."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"The next item is the vote on the motion for urgent procedure with regard to the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0280/1999 - 1999/0236(CNS)] amending Regulation (EEC) No 1251/1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops to include flax and hemp grown for fibre and the proposal for a Council Regulation [COM(1999) 576 - C5-0281/1999 - 1999/0237(CNS)] on the common organisation of the market in flax and hemp grown for fibre."
"These proposals were addressed in Mrs Schierhuber' s report, on which the final vote on 16 May was postponed in accordance with Rule 69 (2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The matter was referred back to committee."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has the floor for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, as the committee responsible."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as Parliament and the Commission are concerned, this regulation raises three issues: first, how to prevent abuse of the aid scheme for flax and hemp, because there have been very significant irregularities under the regulation in the past; secondly, how to ensure that flax and hemp, both of which are impressive, renewable raw materials with a strong ecological and social impact, can continue to be cultivated in the EU."
"And thirdly, we need to protect, consolidate and promote the burgeoning processing industry in this area, an industry producing smart, ecologically valuable, biological degradable products."
"So we agree on the objectives, but we do not agree on how to achieve them, which is why Parliament has postponed the final vote on this report and is currently negotiating with the Commission."
"Considerable progress has been made towards consensus and a compromise has been reached on numerous points."
"We met again yesterday but did not finish editing the compromises and proposed compromises."
"This motion for urgency tabled by the Council or the presidency is therefore premature and we propose therefore that it be rejected for the time being."
"We assume that we will have reached a compromise which can be tabled by July and plenary will then be able to vote on it in July."
"I should like to reiterate my express thanks in this connection to the Commission and Commissioner Fischler, who has been most cooperative in this matter."
"I hope that we shall also be able to take account in this proposal of the fact that the Commission is keen for us to table and complete this procedure this year."
"Thank you."
"The chairman of the Committee on Agriculture has tabled a procedural motion."
"According to the Rules of Procedure, one member may speak for and one member may speak against the motion."
"Mrs Schierhuber has asked to speak."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I agree wholeheartedly with the motion tabled by the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture."
"He has outlined the matter quite clearly."
"I, for my part as rapporteur, should like expressly to thank the Commission for its willingness to negotiate."
"As you know, we still have no co-decision in agriculture, hence the two informal meetings, both of which lasted over an hour."
"We reached a consensus on a great many points and the Commission too was willing to compromise."
"Unfortunately, we have no written documents on which we can really vote and pass resolutions, which is why I support the motion to reject urgency for the time being."
"Mr President, allow me a brief personal comment."
"My professional activities are entered in the presidents' register in accordance with the rules of the European Parliament and I have conducted myself over the last eight years on that basis."
"I have never taken any parliamentary action on matters which bear directly on my corporate interests and have refrained from voting on such matters, despite the fact that I am not obliged to do so."
"For the rest, there has been no occasion on which my voting conduct might be interpreted as representing indirect interests or on which I have departed from the opinion of my group."
"I therefore refute what Mr Seppänen has said."
"President."
"Mr Korakas on a point of order."
"Mr President, we shall shortly be debating Mrs Lalumière' s motion for a resolution on European security and defence."
"It is an important proposal and we each have an opinion on it; however, I think that, if we are to hold a proper debate on this important issue, we should have received the amendments in time."
"We requested the amendments this morning between 8 and 8.30 and they were not available."
"This means that, when the time comes to vote on these amendments, we shall be unable to debate them first."
"Because this also happens with other debates, I should like to ask for measures to be taken so that we receive amendments in time, before reports are debated in plenary."
"Our services tell me that the honourable member is right and that there was a delay in distributing the documents because the deadline was set so late."
"But as we are not due to vote until Thursday, I think that there is some justification for holding the debate nonetheless."
"But basically you are right and we shall make an effort to distribute the documents earlier in future."
"European political parties"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"(B5-0488/00) by Mr Poettering on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Barón Crespo on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Cox on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party and Mr Lannoye on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to the Commission on European political parties;"
"(B5-0494/00) by Mr Pasqua on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group to the Commission on political parties at European level."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to submit seven considerations on this important issue."
"First: in 1991, the European heads of state and government expressly recognised the importance of European political parties in Article 138a of the Treaty of Amsterdam, guided by the idea that full-blown democracy in the European Union cannot be achieved without solidly-funded European political parties set on a reliable legal basis."
"Secondly: next year will mark the tenth year without any material progress with the legal status of European political parties or life breathed into the Treaty."
"The group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats deeply regrets this."
"Thirdly: we would remind the House of the important preliminary work carried out in the Tsatsos report adopted in 1996 and the Kuhne report of 13 April 2000."
"Other reports by the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, the most recent being the Ferber report, have also indicated the urgent need for a European party statute and for this matter to be regulated."
"Fourthly: we therefore welcome the fact that the Commission is prepared to advocate an addendum to Article 191 of the EC Treaty on European political parties and thank President Prodi, Commissioner Barnier and the College as a whole for treating this concern with the importance which it deserves."
"It is this which will enable a solution to be found."
"We hope that the wording selected will allow the Commission to finalise a European party statute quickly, not set the majority requirements in the Council too high and respect full co-decision for the European Parliament."
"Fifthly: we also welcome the fact that the European Commission obviously also confirms the possibility, if my information is correct, of proceeding on the basis of Article 308."
"The possibilities offered by Article 308 must be used if and insofar as the Treaty is not supplemented."
"Nonetheless, we take the firm view that supplementing the Treaty is the best way forward."
"Sixthly: the chairmen of the four largest groups in the European Parliament, i.e. the group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance submitted a proposal for the core elements of a European party statute several months ago, in agreement with the chairmen of the party federations and the Commission, thereby demonstrating that this problem should and could be solved within a broad political consensus."
"We are confident that other groups which do not yet have their own European party can be included in this consensus."
"Seventh and lastly: we are also aware that, until such time as a European party statute enters into force, we need transitional rules regulating and limiting support for European political parties by groups in the European Parliament and we are prepared to take a broad initiative here which crosses the group divide."
"We want to promote the emancipation of European political parties from the groups still further and open up future prospects for them and our main concern is to see European political parties become a major vehicle for European political work."
"We want to give them this opportunity and we want, above all, to ensure that, in all aspects of support for European political parties, we have a transparent situation and clear legal conditions which can be presented as such to the public."
"This will serve the credibility not only of the parties but also of the European Union and the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with the words of chairman Poettering on this joint initiative and, if you will allow me, I would like first of all to remind you that ten years ago we achieved jointly - on that occasion we were the Christian Democratic Party, the Liberals and the Socialists - the inclusion in the Treaty of Maastricht of the article recognising the personality of the political parties."
"It fell to me at that time to negotiate its inclusion with President of the Council Lubbers and I would like to pay tribute to him because I believe that it was an important step."
"We could have chosen to pose the question in reverse, that is to say, why, when the Commission had the monopoly on initiative for ten years, did it not take any step to regulate such an important issue? However, we are taking a constructive view."
"We want to resolve this problem which is not just a question of a legal vacuum but a constitutional problem for the European Union."
"The current situation is becoming increasingly complicated."
"It was traditionally believed in the media that it was necessary to go 'lobbying' in Brussels, to behave like a pressure group."
"We managed to have the political parties recognised. In our countries they are a fundamental pillar of democracy."
"Nevertheless, in ten years, no progress has been made and we truly find ourselves in an increasingly difficult situation."
"We could go so far as to say that at least 75% of the Members of this House are affiliated to organisations which are not clandestine, certainly, but do not have legal status, and demands are continually being made of us, which we try to respect and comply with, by the Court of Auditors, a key institution within the European Union, but which must not be the institution which in reality establishes the legal framework."
"We believe that it is absolutely essential, in order to ensure that it is the democracy of the people and not the power of money, which prevails in the Union, that the Commission should exercise its power of initiative responsibly at the moment."
"We have made certain useful suggestions so that we may find our way out of a situation which is not only unsatisfactory but also negative for the development of democracy in Europe."
"Mr President, the essentials have been covered, but I should like to reiterate the point that the right to propose legislation rests with the Commission."
"We have taken an initiative across the various political groups, which we presented in February to President Prodi."
"As a matter of law there has been a reference to political parties in the Treaty for more than seven years now."
"It states that the parties are a factor for integration, they contribute to the formation of European awareness and are a vital element in the democratic life of the Union and the political debate of the Union."
"However, like several of the rather aspirational articles in the Treaties, Article 191, the article referred to, lacks a certain operational content."
"The question is: can the Commission take an initiative which breathes life and operational content into the aspirations of Article 191?"
"That really is what the debate is about in this House today."
"I share the concern of other speakers that the reports of the Court of Auditors - which, by the way, we fully anticipated in this House several years ago with the report of Professor Tsatsos, which pointed out the urgent necessity of validating parties in statutory terms - adds a new urgency."
"The institutions must be able to deliver accountability and transparency."
"This House does not have the right to draft legislation: that is the exclusive preserve of the Commission."
"We are asking for your assistance to ensure that this vital element, as the Treaty states, in the democratic life and political debate of the Union is validated by statute."
"Mr President, my Group has also been involved in submitting this motion to the Commission, simply on the basis that we are creating a Europe that is undergoing integration, but it is not at all clear that our citizens will be able to have a say in this merging Europe and keep pace with the advance of integration."
"I do not want to say that the political parties are the only, or even necessarily, the most important channel whereby the public can have a say in matters that currently affect society, but they play a part, and the status of the European parties must be defined without delay."
"Just as my colleagues have said, these parties must be brought out into the light of day."
"They are, in any case, already active today."
"They cannot replace the national parties, but cooperation among national parties is no longer necessarily enough."
"It is important that we agree on fully open and transparent financing when the European parties are defined."
"It is, for example, very important that accurate information is available concerning their sources of income, and the financing of elections is of particular importance in this respect, since money must not determine success in elections."
"My Group does not merely intend that we should acquire in this way a funding channel for the European parties, but what is most important is that there will now be the opportunity to define those basic principles on which the European parties can function."
"We must take the view that they must respect fundamental democratic rights, human rights and the principle of the rule of law when they function."
"The time perhaps has come to specify that only European parties such as these may enjoy public support."
"If the legal basis is vague, we agree with the request for the Commission to take an initiative to make it clearer, and the Intergovernmental Conference must also take responsibility for this."
"Mr President, according to the Treaty, parties which contribute to informing the citizens about events which take place within the Union and the European Parliament are political parties, and therefore, by their political activities, they contribute to the development of a European awareness and European knowledge."
"But what is European awareness?"
"It may be that the Treaties are not sufficiently clear on this subject, seeing that they do not mention the rights of the disabled and they do not provide enough protection for children and babies, who are nowadays particularly affected by widespread paedophilia in Europe."
"European consciousness is that which must contribute to the development of mutual respect, which must prevent one culture prevailing over another, and which must ensure that tolerance is not confused with laxity and an absence of rules and laws and that laws and rules are not made with the intention of protecting some and not others."
"The European culture is born of respect for our national cultures and national traditions. New elements are integrated, but this must not lead to a situation where one category of individuals dominates to the detriment of another."
"The citizens of the Union need greater protection of their rights, economic and otherwise, in the face of a world market which is becoming increasingly dominated by the interests of multinationals and of a world market created, one might say, to serve political as well as other purposes."
"Therefore, European parties are not those parties which, to further party interest, have the same acronym in different countries, but those parties whose common ideals, values and programmes lead them to unite within groups and to work together to give the citizens a louder voice and greater representativity"
"So, à la Voltaire, if you want to talk to me, lay down the rules now."
"We have to clarify whether the European parties are something that we want to develop now, something different which will overlap with the national parties, that is if we desire cultural and political globalisation to follow economic globalisation - which would bring total uniformity - or whether we want, effectively, to build a Europe in which parties with the same affinities and ideals can work together at European level."
"European parties, let us not kid ourselves!"
"Before hearing the speakers for the groups, I would like to give the floor to Commissioner Barnier."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my Group chairman has tipped me the wink and I am able to say on behalf of our group, the PPE-DE, that we fully support and welcome the Commission' s explanations in reply to the oral question, as regards both what was said and the timetable and legal evaluation."
"Secondly: I am also delighted that we are again stepping up the political debate on the party statute, the pressure of time in the run up to the final stage of the intergovernmental conference notwithstanding."
"This is not just a question of money."
"This is also a question of political self-awareness, a question of political identity, a question of the role of national and European parties in the unification process."
"We want a stronger European Parliament and that means reducing unanimity and increasing the co-decision powers of the European Parliament."
"But a stronger European Parliament depends on strong groups in Parliament which have the authority to act."
"We want a strong Commission which drives the European integration process forward."
"One of the ways in which this is expressed is by lobbying for the President' s function to be strengthened and through parliament' s proposals to the intergovernmental conference."
"We want a statute for European political parties because our democracy is a civil and party-political parliamentary democracy."
"But we must not underestimate the psychological importance of this debate."
"At present people and national parties are elected."
"We want, as we have stated in the proposal to the intergovernmental conference, members on European lists to be elected because we want to raise the European political profile of members further still."
"The proposal was touched on at the intergovernmental conference."
"I readily admit that we want European lists and European members of parliament."
"The proposals have been made; it all depends on the European party statute."
"The report by the Court of Auditors containing demands on the groups was also touched on."
"We shall comply with these demands."
"My group started taking steps in this direction even before the Court of Auditors' report in order to clarify this transparency and this division."
"But it cannot work against the European parties because that would represent a reduction in our European self-awareness."
"That is also why the party statute is one of the conditions which needs to be put in place so that we can in fact quickly do what is demanded of us and what we demand of ourselves."
"Mr President, I take good note of Commissioner Barnier' s statement and the commitment which the Commission is making."
"Please allow me to express, not a criticism, but surprise in relation to the unassailable legal basis."
"The Union Treaty, at that time signed by the twelve Heads of State and Government and ratified by all the parliaments of the Member States with the approval of the European Parliament, which recognises citizenship, is not, it appears, a sufficient legal basis."
"This surprises me because to be associated with a political party is a fundamental right for citizens and, while our citizenship is recognised, that right is not."
"We did not manage to have this included in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The Commission is behaving gingerly and takes this approach: two stages, almost three stages, according to the Commissioner."
"I understand that the proposal relating to the tripartite dialogue and stemming from Article 308 is a provisional proposed legislative provision and the best laws, at least in my country, are provisional laws, which are the ones which have lasted the longest."
"This would allow us to end this current situation of a lack of legal status, and I take good note of this and I believe we should work in that direction."
"The second step is the amendment of the Treaties."
"I believe I can say that we all support it, but the important thing at the moment is, firstly, the existence of a public commitment by the Commission to exercise its right to initiative, a common will to consolidate a fundamental dimension for European citizenship and contribute immediately to the political parties beginning not only to exist in reality, but also to be legally recognised, because I believe that this is an important step towards the construction of European democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I naturally concur with Mrs Hautala' s views on transparency."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his proposal in which we will be given the opportunity to exchange ideas here with Parliament which is, after all, eminently suited to express its opinion on this matter."
"But what we need is an initiative - albeit hopelessly overdue - from the Commission."
"After all, for the past twenty years, we at the European Free Alliance have been bringing together political parties which want to help build Europe on the basis of a diversity of cultures, peoples and regions."
"In this connection, we have always attempted to stand up for the small and the weak, who cannot represent themselves in this big Parliament but whose concerns we are trying to take into consideration."
"Up to now, it has been impossible to do this fully transparently, because there has been no clarity with regard to the European parties' expenditure and revenue, among other things."
"But there are questions left unanswered concerning the future too."
"It has not yet been mentioned here, Commissioner, but I would like to raise the question nevertheless."
"Will the European democratic parties which in future appoint themselves as European parties only be supported if they stand for the values on which Europe is built?"
"This seems a rhetorical question to me."
"I hope that the Commission can give me a clear answer to it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are totally opposing views on European political parties within my group."
"The main question raised is the extent to which they can actually represent a European public."
"Direct links with people exist not at a pan-European, but at national or regional level."
"That is where the parties are anchored, that is where their members and electorate are."
"The situation is in fact quite paradoxical."
"First, there are European parties."
"Secondly, there is Article 191, which states that European political parties are an important factor for integration. Thirdly, at the same time, we still have no idea what European political parties actually are."
"On 12 December last year, the chairmen of the Party of European Socialists, the European People' s Party, the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and the European Free Alliance and the secretary-general of the European Federation of Green Parties themselves stated in a joint declaration that clarification was needed as to what a European party is."
"Now I am convinced that, outside this House, no-one, to all intents and purposes, can comprehend or understand this."
"Plus, the parties tend to take themselves very seriously."
"It is not by chance that citizens - and not just in my country - are highly sceptical about things such as party memberships."
"When they commit, it is mainly in civil initiatives, non-governmental organisations and various structures within the civil society."
"I have nothing against European parties."
"I think that they face the challenge of achieving cross-border coordination of their work during the course of integration."
"But one thing is unacceptable and that is a situation in which European parties exist and receive funding but are still undefined."
"The criticism of the Court of Auditors was justified."
"I should like to close by saying that I too am in favour of finding a solution to this muddle."
"But the solution must include treating political democratic forces in Europe equally, including those which define themselves otherwise and which, for example, are critical of the EU, and not excluding them from this problem-solving process."
"Mr President, I would first of all, perhaps specifically for the benefit of the German delegates, insofar as they still care about respecting the rule of law, like to remind you of the judgement by the German Constitutional Court of Karlsruhe, in which the European Union is unambiguously defined as a confederacy, and hence the opposite of a federal state."
"In fact, this vision of the European Union is also held by the large majority of citizens of our Member States for whom our Union is a close partnership of free peoples and states which very clearly respects the principle of subsidiarity."
"In the light of this, the project of European political parties is the umpteenth fundamentally undemocratic project because it can only widen the enormous chasm which exists between the electorate on the one hand and European political decision-making on the other."
"But this is apparently the price which some, hiding behind a mask of rhetoric, are willing to pay here in order to channel even more of the taxpayers' money to already excessive party funds."
"It is also a project of people who are hoping to create the European federal superstate."
"Indeed, these people are trying to attain their goal, the undemocratic federal superstate, by guile, and seize upon a variety of issues, including monetary union, the unified statute for MEPs and the possible accession of countries which are not even geographically situated in Europe, such as Turkey, to help them reach that goal."
"In a European Union which really respects the principle of subsidiarity, we do not need a European political party."
"Anyone who has different ideas about Europe or who would like to increase the pompe afrique, the money pump from the taxpayer to the European political parties, should have the courage to stand up and speak out, but you are lacking this courage."
"Mr President, I am a strong supporter of cooperation between peoples."
"Many problems can only be solved jointly."
"Global problems must be solved in the UN."
"The court here in Strasbourg can support us in connection with human rights."
"In Brussels, we have close economic cooperation between the EU and the EEA in connection with a common market."
"Would we obtain better solutions, however, if decision-making were, in every conceivable case, to be centralised in Brussels?"
"Would we obtain better democracy by downgrading the national parties and raising the profile of common supranational parties?"
"Would more people join, become active members and take part in debates in connection with elections and decision-making?"
"Supranational EU parties are an artificial product which will never be financed through voluntary subscriptions but only by siphoning off EU funds."
"We are familiar with the pattern from many national parties which have distanced themselves from the electorate and instead allow themselves to be financed by the State, business and the unions."
"It is quite right that the State should support parliamentary work and provide citizens with information."
"It must not, however, be a propaganda machine for the view of the majority."
"To quote Grundtvig, doyen of the public education movement in Denmark, there must be 'freedom for Loki as well as for Thor' ."
"The supranational EU parties will never win the hearts and minds of ordinary people."
"They will instead be populated by highly paid officials bound to no country in particular - bureaucrats without roots in local political associations."
"Manifestos will be written by small groups of experts out of touch with the lives of real people."
"An artificial product of that kind does not deserve financial support from the EU."
"My group will vote against subsidies for supranational EU parties and against bending the Treaty by using flexible clauses for that purpose."
"Mr President, this is a question of democracy."
"Democracy is transparency, public accessibility, rule by the people, and participation."
"The current European political parties do not represent transparency or public accessibility."
"It is a rhetorical question, but who of us knows anything about the European political parties?"
"The only certainty is that some groups in the European Parliament have given financial support to the Europarties, contrary to the regulations concerning parliamentary funds."
"They have been discovered in the investigations conducted by the Court of Auditors."
"I suspect these abuses are now being covered up."
"The European political parties do not represent democracy."
"They are parties of parties and that means that the public does not have the opportunity to participate directly in their activities."
"For rule by the nation, you need a nation."
"Europe is not a nation; it is nations."
"We have no concept of supranational democracy."
"Now, supranational rules and regulations for Europarties controlled by the big countries are being drawn up, with the Commission' s support, by the big parties in the big countries."
"Parties of parties are not democracy."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Security and defence"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"(B5-0315/2000) by Mr Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the European Common Security and Defence Policy in view of the European Council meeting in Feira;"
"(B5-0475/00) by Mr Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Commission on the European Common Security and Defence Policy in view of the European Council meeting in Feira."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and I should like to start by saying that I consider this, to all intents and purposes, to be the first reading of the Lalumière report, because Mrs Lalumière has invested a great deal of expertise and work in this project."
"We must stress that, after Amsterdam, Cologne and Helsinki, a great deal of progress has been made in developing the foreign, security and defence policy and we would like to thank the Council and the Commission for making this progress possible in these areas."
"It is the result of our understanding that a disaster such as we have witnessed in the Balkans must never happen again."
"We must guarantee that Europe has the authority to act in the area of foreign, security and defence policy, the authority which allows us to safeguard our interests jointly; however, at the same time, we must make it clear that this is not an alternative to the transatlantic alliance."
"This development complements NATO, which will continue to remain responsible for collective security in Europe."
"We as the European Parliament have already come to this conclusion by intensifying and institutionalising collaboration with the NATO parliamentary assembly."
"We must realise that Amsterdam transferred the Petersberg tasks of the WEU to the European Union and that, as a result, practically all areas of the Western European Union now come under the responsibility of the European Union."
"All that remains is Article 5."
"I think this Intergovernmental Conference should consider whether Article 5 can be adopted in the form of a protocol to the EU Treaty and whether we should leave it to each Member State to take a sovereign decision as to whether or not it subscribes to this protocol."
"This is surely a way for non-allied, neutral countries to find their own way as members of the European Union while, at the same time, allowing collaboration in practically all circumstances."
"In the long run, this must be credibly sustained by the European Union."
"We are a Union with our own legislation, which has resulted in our own legal system, and with our own interests based on the internal market and monetary union, which is why areas with different standards of security within the European Union must be a thing of the past."
"This will surely help to develop a coherent foreign, security and defence policy."
"We can see, precisely in Community matters, that the European Union has a plethora of instruments which are important for foreign and security policy, especially for civil crisis management, and that we are therefore able to provide more foreign aid than the United States Congress, that trade policy is the responsibility of the Commission and therefore that the nucleus of our potential to act is a Community remit and that we should not assign the development of a foreign, security and defence policy to intergovernmental collaboration."
"The European Parliament will advocate bringing the Community position, the Community part to the fore."
"We are of course delighted that we have a highly qualified High Representative in the person of Mr Solana, but it has always been the aim of the European Parliament in the long run to have a European foreign secretary incorporated into the Community area as part of the Commission."
"This is unattainable at present for certain reasons, but we should strive towards it."
"It is still our aim."
"We can see that the Commission has a large stake and that foreign and security policy is being formulated in the European Council."
"Defence is still a matter for national governments when it comes to equipment and similar questions."
"This must be merged, including practically, so that such absurdities never occur again."
"If we just think that today the foreign secretary of Kazakhstan will be received by fifteen foreign secretaries, the Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs and the High Representative, then I think this makes for wonderful Council meetings, but it is not a sign of any particular authority to act on the part of the European Union."
"I think that we must speak up with one voice more loudly here and the Troika of Council President, High Representative and Commissioner for Foreign Affairs introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam should first establish the Union' s authority to act; we should not have any other definitions in this area."
"We must also ensure that this Treaty improves our decision-making mechanisms and we should not forget the huge shortcomings brought to light in the organisational disaster in Kosovo, which are the reason for the lack of an arms export policy and which have so far forestalled unity in the EU Treaty."
"We must recognise the fact that we are squandering money in national budgets."
"We spend more on defence than America, but with far fewer results."
"This also applies to transport, satellites and such like."
"According to the Treaty, this European Parliament is responsible for parliamentary control, including and especially of the Petersberg tasks, which is why the control function of the European Parliament must also be strengthened."
"We shall also endeavour to bring about cooperation as well as collaboration with the foreign and defence policy committees of national parliaments in order to close gaps and cooperate with the parliaments of candidate and other countries."
"But this European Parliament is named in the Treaty as the parliamentary controller of foreign, security and defence policy to the exclusion of all others."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during Portugal' s Presidency of the European Union the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy has been regarded as a priority, as is evident from the document which we presented at the beginning."
"The report to be submitted to the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira will detail the progress made on the various mandates received in Helsinki. In particular it will cover the development of the European military capability, the headline goal, the institutional development of the permanent political and military bodies, the relations between the European Union and third countries in this area, the relations between the European Union and NATO, an indication of whether or not the EU Treaty needs to be revised and the problem of non-military crisis management mechanisms."
"In the area of foreign policy and the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the EU has decided to develop the military and non-military dimensions in parallel."
"We clearly must coordinate these two dimensions and particularly the military and non-military crisis management actions which the EU may decide to undertake."
"This coordination will be carried out by the new structures of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in particular by the Political and Security Committee, the future Military Committee and the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management."
"I must point out that the interim bodies started work in March 2000 and that the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management was formally created during the Portuguese Presidency."
"As will be evident from the Presidency' s report to the Feira European Council, an effort is being made to simultaneously develop the military and non-military crisis management capabilities. The Member States have already been working to develop the headline goal."
"For example this was discussed yesterday at a meeting of the General Affairs Council attended by the Defence Ministers. The Feira European Council will also see the Member States make a commitment to develop their civil police capability by 2003, with up to 5 000 officers, for crisis management operations."
"This represents a major effort by the Member States to ensure sustained and uniform development of these two dimensions which are fundamental for security and stability."
"On another issue raised in Mr Brok' s question, I must say that strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy by developing a common European security and defence policy, thus allowing the EU to establish a military capability and also to reinforce the efficacy of its civilian crisis management mechanisms, does not necessarily require an increase in the defence budgets of the Member States."
"Rather, the basic objective will be to improve the use and rationalisation of the military assets and capabilities of the Member States."
"In this context it must be said that the European Union will use, in order to develop the headline goal, the NATO defence planning, the planning and review process for countries which are not members of NATO and the defence capabilities initiative which is ongoing within the Alliance."
"Every effort is being made to ensure effective use of all the assets and capabilities and to avoid the duplication which could lead to additional defence costs."
"No increase in the Community budget is planned as these efforts are to be implemented by the Member States in a context of voluntary cooperation."
"A final answer on the budgetary impact of this policy may only be given, however, after the Commitment Capability Conference to be held in the autumn. This will analyse the national military contributions to this joint effort and the shortfalls which it may be considered necessary to meet."
"As for the involvement of the European Parliament in this process, it should be recalled that the Common European Security and Defence Policy is a component of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The EU intends to make its foreign dimension more effective and credible by developing military and civilian crisis management capabilities."
"Under Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, Parliament shall be consulted by the Presidency on the main aspects and the basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The views of Parliament shall be taken into consideration by the Council."
"The European Parliament shall also be kept regularly informed of the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and may ask the Council about aspects which it considers are important and may make recommendations which it deems appropriate."
"The need to avoid unnecessary duplication and to make the best use of all the existing assets and capabilities also underlies the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy. It is therefore natural that the Member States have from the beginning advocated the transfer of WEU powers which could prove useful in the process now under way in the European Union."
"Portugal, which holds the Presidency of the WEU, has tried to advance the process for transferring powers from the WEU to the European Union."
"The Portuguese Presidency has therefore prepared a set of political and military concepts and procedures which, following the WEU Council of Ministers meeting in Oporto, will be transferred to the European Union. This constitutes a fundamental part of the acquis which must be preserved."
"During our Presidency of the WEU, preparations for the process of transferring the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre of the WEU have also been started. This will occur during the next presidency."
"The WEU has already taken the decision to allow the EU direct access to these structures."
"Therefore, in accordance with the desire expressed by the Member States, the transfer of the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre will take place."
"The transfer of powers from the WEU to the EU does not imply the end of the WEU; at least this is not the current aim of the Member States."
"The amended Treaty of Brussels will remain in force without any further changes. This is why the collective defence mechanism specified in Article 5 will also remain in operation for the States which have signed this Treaty, as will the Parliamentary Assembly, which will continue to operate fully."
"However, the whole organisational structure will be slimmed down. This will then simply provide support to a permanent council which will meet when necessary and to other structures which will continue to operate, in particular the Western Europe Armaments Group."
"The budget for this organisation will also be substantially reduced."
"The Common European Security and Defence Policy requires a close, intense and transparent relationship between the European Union and NATO."
"The Portuguese Presidency has paid particular attention to developing ways of establishing this relationship, which must be based on cooperation, dialogue and transparency. However, it must not threaten the autonomy of these two organisations."
"The report to be presented to the Feira European Council includes a document establishing the principles and terms of this relationship during this interim period."
"Four ad hoc working groups involving the EU and NATO will be created on the following issues: security, European military capability, development of processes for transferring NATO assets and capabilities to operations led by the European Union and, finally, definition of the permanent terms of the relationship between the European Union and NATO."
"If necessary, other working groups on specific issues may be created."
"In its effort to develop the European military capability, the EU must take into account the need to maintain a relationship of cooperation, dialogue and consultation with European allies who are not members of the European Union and with the applicant countries."
"It must be stressed that the headline goal defined in Helsinki is open to participation by these countries which may therefore contribute to the European force."
"According to the document agreed by the European Union which will form an integral part of the Feira European Council report, a single and inclusive structure will be created in which the fifteen Member States of the European Union and the fifteen third countries will participate."
"This structure will be responsible for dialogue, cooperation and consultation between these countries."
"In view of the fundamental role of the six European allies who are not members of the European Union and also bearing in mind that NATO may provide assets and capabilities for operations led by the EU, meetings will take place within this single structure between the Fifteen and these six countries to discuss issues involving the development of the European military capability."
"In the pre-crisis phase or rather at the start of a crisis, dialogue, cooperation and consultation will clearly be reinforced and, if the EU were to consider using NATO assets and capabilities, particular attention would be given to the dialogue, cooperation and consultation with the six European allies who are not members of the EU."
"It must be stressed that, under the terms agreed in Helsinki, EU operations will in principle be open to participation by these countries."
"Russia, Ukraine and other European countries may also participate in operations led by the European Union."
"The French Presidency will be responsible for presenting the Nice European Council with proposals on the terms for the consultation and participation of these countries."
"At the Feira European Council, the European Union will record the interest expressed by Canada in participating in this joint European effort."
"Finally, in Helsinki the Portuguese Presidency was given the task of presenting the Feira European Council with an indication of whether or not the Treaty of Amsterdam needs to be revised."
"From the debate conducted and the opinions expressed, it has been possible to conclude that the implementation of the EU decisions on the Common European Security and Defence Policy does not require the Treaty to be revised as this policy falls legally within the provisions currently in force."
"However, as this is a process that is open to developments, the Member States have agreed on the need to keep an eye on this issue."
"Mr President, I welcome this timely and useful debate, which was introduced characteristically and forcefully by my honourable friend, Mr Brok, in a thoughtful and useful speech."
"I welcome the report by Mrs Lalumière."
"It is an exceptionally helpful document."
"What it says about non-military crisis management provides us with a checklist, an action list of things we should be making sure are put in place over the next few years."
"It is a very good report, and I would like to congratulate the honourable lady, without reservation, on what she has said."
"The Commission has actively contributed to non-military crisis management since long before the Cologne and Helsinki Summits."
"These summits have reminded us that there is an urgent need for our policies to become more ambitious, coherent and effective."
"We need to improve our capacity for rapid and targeted action."
"We need to step up our efforts of coordination."
"We need to improve the availability of analysis and information exchange, and we need to radically enhance our capacities for pursuing preventive policies."
"The creation of additional instruments, or the mobilisation of additional funding, does not, in my judgement, stand in the centre of current deliberations; nor are far-reaching Treaty changes required."
"Instead, our focus lies on using existing instruments and financial resources considerably more efficiently."
"Parliament knows the priority which the Commission and I attach to discharging our existing competencies a great deal more energetically and a great deal more competently than we have in the past."
"That gives us a considerable agenda for the next few years."
"I hope that we will have the support of Parliament in working through it."
"We should build on existing competencies."
"We should bring them to bear more effectively on the twin goals of conflict prevention and crisis management."
"Saying 'no' to institutional revolution does not mean turning our backs on innovation."
"The Commission recently tabled a proposal for the creation of a rapid reaction facility."
"The limited funds we think are required for that facility will be found by redeployment within our existing budget."
"I also believe that the idea to set up a European civil police corps merits careful examination through a feasibility study by the Council, as proposed in the relevant European Parliament resolution."
"It is also plain that the Commission's lack of human resources for both conflict prevention and crisis management greatly impinges upon our capacity to make more rapid progress in this field, though that is something we are attempting at present to address."
"Let me be clear about the Commission's role."
"We are plainly not responsible for coordination of the military and civil components in crisis management."
"What the Commission is trying to do is to ensure an effective and coherent Community input into the overall coordinated effort of the Union in this area."
"I have spoken before about the impossibility of making a clear distinction, in preventing a crisis or in managing a crisis, between the military and the civil components."
"The important thing is to recognise the relationship between the two."
"Look at what the Commission is doing around the world: we are paying for the training of police in anti-terrorism tasks in Palestine."
"We are helping to create border services in the Balkans."
"We are spending money on de-mining in virtually every continent."
"Those are the sorts of ways in which the Commission is contributing to preventative diplomacy and I hope that in future Europe will manage those tasks in a more coherent way."
"This is not our first effort to create as it were a common foreign and security policy."
"We had the Pleven plan."
"We had de Gasperi."
"We had Fouchet."
"We had years of European political cooperation, during which there were lots of ringing declarations, perhaps slightly too many of them, some weeks after they could actually have any effect on events."
"The decision taken at Maastricht, the decision taken at Amsterdam, the decision taken at Helsinki - they all mark a signal move forward, a recognition that we have not done enough in the past to ensure that Europe's voice is heard adequately around the world and that Europe's capacities to prevent and manage crises are brought to bear with sufficient competence and vigour."
"This time we have to make a difference."
"This time we have to ensure that a common foreign and security policy ensures that Europe discharges its responsibilities at the level which events require, at the level which our citizens now in my judgement demand."
"We in the Commission want to play our full part in ensuring that this time a common foreign and security policy is a resounding success."
"Mr President, the decisions made at the Helsinki European Council on the development of a common security and defence policy are open to interpretation."
"Many aligned countries believe that the formation of a common military force would mean the start of a common defence arrangement."
"Their plans are clear."
"Under the treaties, the aim of a common foreign and security policy for the Union is to safeguard its independence and integrity, as well as strengthen its security in all its forms."
"The military force to be established is, in their view, a tool to realise these aims: a common army for a Union that is becoming a federation."
"In the opinion of the non-aligned Member States, only the creation of a system for crisis management has been decided upon."
"They stress that each country should decide separately on its involvement."
"They believe that they have no obligation to become involved in enforcing peace."
"Non-aligned Member States do not want the Union to become a military alliance or military superpower."
"These differences of opinion and interpretation must be taken into account."
"It is also wise in security policy to establish differentiated integration."
"Combined troops of the European Union should only be used for crisis management."
"Countries which are part of the federal core, as proposed by Messrs Delors, Giscard d' Estaing, Schmidt and Fischer, could create a defence community, to form a strong European pillar within the context of NATO."
"The understandable and commendable aim by the European NATO countries to develop a European defence identity should thus be realised within the context of NATO itself."
"Decisions relating to security and defence policy are immensely important, and should therefore be made with the emphasis on openness and democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is useful to remind ourselves and to realise that we are in the first round of many of a debate on European security."
"This means that we have imposed a few restrictions on ourselves."
"We are very much focusing on the Summit, the European Council of Feira, which is fine, but that means that we will not be covering a number of other issues which are vital to European security."
"One such issue which we are not discussing today is the criteria for the deployment of this rapid reaction force."
"I am sure that we will be discussing this issue following a further report by Mrs Lalumière in due course, but in the meantime, we are subject to a few restrictions."
"Despite these restrictions, we are able to pass a sound verdict now, in my opinion."
"Let me start by making a positive comment."
"A large part of the resolution is taken up by non-military crisis management, and this is very much how it should be, in my opinion."
"The Commissioner spent quite a long time talking about this and I think he had every reason to."
"According to my group, the EU has unique opportunities in this respect which, so far, have remained for the most part untapped."
"Fortunately, there are also examples of how things can be done, for example, the Stability Pact, which is a mixture of economic reconstruction, promotion of human rights and the development of a civil society."
"This is a good example of how, also in future, the Union will be able to use its nearly unlimited options in the field of non-military crisis management."
"But military resources also form part of this package and, this may surprise some delegates, this is also largely backed by my group, albeit subject to a number of conditions."
"I would like to specify two."
"One is the EU' s say."
"In my opinion, it should be crystal clear, and this is not included in the present texts, that the EU has autonomous power of decision and that the EU countries must be able to decide for themselves on their level of commitment, without needing permission from NATO - or should that be the US?"
"I would like to make one final point."
"It cannot be the case that the new military resources which are required will be over and above the ones we have at the moment and that, as such, a new arms race would be created for military resources."
"What is important is that the analysis and security policy are new."
"This does not necessarily include more resources."
"Mr President, there are matters which give rise to fundamental differences of opinion and this is obviously one of them."
"You, Mrs Lalumière, have obtained the backing of a large majority in committee and you will no doubt maintain this majority in plenary."
"This majority confirms the quality of your work and the care which has gone into it."
"But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become."
"I do not see this is a cause for celebration."
"Even official threat analyses confirm that there is no military threat to the countries of western Europe."
"Instead, scenarios such as the war in Kosovo or imaginary crises in the future, Islamic fundamentalism or, as in the German defence guidelines, even possible ecological threats are wheeled out in order to justify huge military spending."
"It marks the capitulation of politics and of the intellect, when such problems are met with a military response."
"Let me pick up on just one issue, an issue which figured at the centre of all the positions taken here today: the war in Kosovo."
"I think that the Council, the Commission and we ourselves are drawing the wrong conclusions in principle from a war which was wrong in principle."
"First, the violation of international law, as practised by NATO, and which, for the rest, still forms part of the official NATO military strategy, should not shape future security policy."
"Secondly, I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent, preventive, long-term policy, especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disastrously."
"War, if anything, is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect."
"Finally, when it is again argued that the war in Kosovo demonstrated that the EU needs major military independence from the USA then, to my mind, this begs the conclusion that militarising international relations and security policy will increase, not reduce dependency on the USA."
"Military is what the USA does best."
"My group takes an opposing view in principle to the present prevalent European security policy on at least three counts."
"First: the security policy template is a military, not a political, civil or cooperative one and the section on preventive and civil security policy cannot hide that fact."
"It is interesting that military resolutions have been coming thick and fast since the Helsinki Summit while, to all intents and purposes, nothing has been done about a civil, cause-orientated security policy."
"Secondly: we reject a European military block formation."
"The only viable approach, in our view, is to restore the central role of the UNO for international security, reinforce the OSCE, design cooperative security concepts and radically disarm."
"Thirdly: we are deeply concerned at how automatically demands are rejected which, until just recently, formed part of a broad political consensus, at least between Mrs Lalumière and, for example, the positions represented in my group."
"In all events, demands for an unequivocal declaration on the UN charter, defence of the ABM treaty, respect for the policy of neutrality of certain EU Member States or an increase in funds for peace education and peace studies failed to muster a majority in committee."
"Germany has earmarked DM 17.5 million for civil conflict management projects this year."
"I think it is a fairly typical figure."
"It represents - and let me say this very slowly - 0.00029% of military spending."
"I fear that this policy first creates crises which it then endeavours to control."
"Which is why there is nothing left for us but to say a firm No."
"Mr President, we take a different approach to the important point raised by our colleague, Mr Brok' s question to the Council."
"This is an important issue, because, following the very serious crises that have struck the Balkans, the European Council, especially in its Cologne and Helsinki declarations of June and December 1999 and the Presidency, particularly in the two reports it has drawn up on the Union' s military and civilian resources for dealing with crisis situations, have demonstrated their intention to see the Union become more closely involved in the management of crises that threaten European security, interests and values."
"A number of European Union Member States, but also non-members, may perceive such threats as common threats."
"The issue of concern to us, then, is how we envisage establishing an intergovernmental process which deals with each country individually and which would allow all the States that wish to commit themselves, to actually do so and combine forces, while not forcing any State that does not so desire to take part against their will in a course of action of which it may not approve."
"The organisation of this kind of intervention capability must not, however, be designed in ideological terms, as a factor to make political integration binding."
"Such an approach would lead to failure."
"It must be seen in terms of specific crisis situations which are likely to occur, whilst respecting the freedom and the will of each of our States."
"Treating each case individually will enable us to do this and to establish a type of reaction that is appropriate to the type of crisis and in line with the will of the people."
"Furthermore, the question of the financial resources allocated to the establishment of civilian and military capabilities which are likely to be united is obviously a crucial one."
"It requires significant budgetary input and therefore a radical reversal of the trend that has been seen in most Member States, unlike the United States, since the end of the cold war."
"It would be useful to know whether the Council feels that the upturn in growth in Europe is such as to favour this essential turnaround and how the Council intends to promote it."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to the person who submitted the oral questions for creating the opportunity, before the Feira Summit, to debate the CFSP, which is shrouded in mystery."
"Its lack of transparency is characterised by a multitude of initiatives and ever changing coalitions."
"I would nonetheless like to try to make a few observations."
"First of all, I wonder whether the creation of a European identity is backed by sound motives."
"I would like to stress that we should not be guided by power motives."
"If we only focus on a strong role for Europe on the world stage, then we have got it all wrong."
"It is not about power, but about taking responsibility."
"This cannot be done without joining forces with NATO as the latter has all the necessary resources available."
"I should also like to warn against all too unrealistic expectations as far as cooperation between the Member States in this respect is concerned."
"A realistic view of the current developments in Europe shows that paper declarations from St. Malo, Cologne and Helsinki have so far not been accompanied by real security guarantees."
"The required ""firm political commitment on the part of all Member States"" of Paragraph 19 of the resolution is lacking."
"These brief comments do not detract from the fact that it is important to include this subject on the IGC agenda."
"We need plain agreements on competencies in this field."
"And as far as we are concerned, these are still mainly within the national state."
"Mr President, we must recognise that the progress that has been made in recent months in the field of security and defence policy originated from the informal Council of Defence Ministers in Sintra, which should be included on the list of successes of the Portuguese Presidency."
"One of the many and complex problems involved in the development of this policy, which necessarily requires greater involvement by Finance Ministers and Defence Ministers, is the role and influence of the institutions."
"At this initial stage, Mr President, Parliament should be more involved in the development of this policy."
"We should be thinking about a parliamentary dimension for the common security and defence policy which includes the establishment of mechanisms necessary for Parliament to participate, with its corresponding institutional role, in the definition and the objectives of that policy."
"Furthermore, the appropriate measures should be taken for the Parliament to exercise control over the security and defence policy and so that it is constantly and adequately informed of its tasks and of the provisional bodies which currently work in the service of the Council of Ministers of the European Union."
"What I have just said with regard to Parliament, Mr President, is equally valid for the Commission."
"The balance between the institutions should not be altered in the case of such an important question."
"We should clarify the competencies of the Commission and the Council, since there is an unresolved tension between intergovernmental and Community powers."
"The ambiguity with regard to the limits of the Commission' s role is particularly evident in the field of security and should be clarified once and for all, since we must not forget that the harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission has given rise to the successes of the European integration project, and we should work and fight for its restoration."
"Furthermore, Mr President, this European Union project is not just a matter of a political, economic and military union."
"Our project is based, or should be based, fundamentally on a community of values."
"We in the European Union do not simply define ourselves as consumers in a big market place, but as citizens of the Union."
"The citizens of the Union, represented by Parliament, increasingly want to be involved in this area which concerns them and affects them directly, namely the common security and defence policy."
"Mr President, last month we celebrated Europe Day."
"Central to this was Robert Schuman' s speech of 9 May 1950."
"A lot has changed since then, but Robert Schuman' s and Jean Monnet' s basic axiom to the effect that a lasting peace is created by weaving peoples and nations together in mutually enriching dependence is still valid."
"Security is created through cooperation pure and simple, as well as through integration and enlargement."
"Schuman began his speech with these words: 'World peace cannot be preserved without constructive efforts to combat impending dangers' ."
"This far-sighted approach permeates the Socialist Group' s vision of Europe' s foreign and security policy and is also a persistent theme in Mrs Lalumière' s report on the eve of Feira, a report which our Group supports wholeheartedly."
"For Social Democrats like ourselves, there are two complementary dimensions to the challenge of security policy in the twenty-first century."
"The first is the global dimension, and the second is the purely European dimension."
"Seen in a global perspective, security is clearly indivisible."
"We share the same planet and the same fate."
"In today' s globalised world following the end of the cold war, poverty and exclusion stand out as the main enemies of peace and democracy."
"No military arsenals and no new nuclear arms race can provide security against the resentment of the poor."
"Generous, fair and far-sighted aid, together with a trade policy which attacks the causes of poverty and insecurity must therefore be an integral part of our foreign and security policy."
"In the same way, we must look at conflict prevention and crisis management in the context of our new European security policy."
"We are, of course, loyal to the decisions taken in Helsinki."
"We should constructively develop the military capacity which the war in Kosovo, in particular, has necessarily brought about."
"The headline goals which have been established are important and must be implemented in full, without delay and without exception."
"At the same time, we must, however, oppose those who wish to exaggerate our military capacity and role."
"We should accept increased responsibility for security on our own continent, but we should not take the place of NATO or create an embryonic form of permanent and independent European defence."
"Such ambitions are pure fantasy and mere tilting at windmills."
"A policy on conflict prevention is missing from our arsenal."
"We must therefore actively support the proposals tabled by Commissioner Patten and also by the Council, together with the proposals in Mrs Lalumière' s report."
"Mr President, slowly and all too belatedly, a common European security policy is in the process of taking shape, one which, though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth to say so, is, at it were, being built on the ruins of Kosovo."
"The EU did not manage to stop the catastrophe in the Balkans in time, and we shall forever be accountable to our children for this failure."
"As Liberals, we consider it absolutely crucial for the EU to be able in future to intervene with personnel and resources in countries in its immediate vicinity, to be able to engage in civil crisis management, humanitarian efforts and peace-keeping exercises based on European values and human rights."
"The EU must adopt a credible and independent policy in this area, but it is important to retain the commitment of the United States and the transatlantic link."
"NATO is at present the most important organisation for peace and security in Europe."
"The EU' s Member States must nonetheless soon come to some definite decisions about the common security policy."
"There are three main questions which must be answered at Feira and which I want to submit to the Council."
"What is the distribution of labour between the EU and NATO to look like?"
"We must develop complementary, and not duplicate, structures."
"How will it be possible to guarantee the influence of the non-aligned States upon expanding security policy?"
"Thirdly, a question in connection with which there are many good proposals in Mrs Lalumière' s excellent report: how will it be possible for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to be guaranteed influence upon, and participation in, the decisions so that the latter are made openly and democratically in the interests of our European citizens?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to the priorities for Feira, the European Union must strengthen the civil conflict prevention dimension of its policy."
"That means, as far as weighting instruments is concerned, that the financial and material focus must be on an effective conflict prevention policy."
"The main lines of conflict today are to be found in domestic conflicts and this proves that the rich countries lack the will to do enough to foster sustainable and socially-balanced development in the crisis regions."
"The opportunity was missed in Helsinki to give concrete expression to an active prevention policy and efficient and prompt crisis management and we urgently need to make up lost ground here."
"I congratulate Mr Patten on his activities in this direction, which I should like to support and help develop further."
"In building up conflict prevention and after-care instruments, the focus needs to be on combining a reduction in the production and sale of arms and stricter controls."
"One more point: the importance of Parliament."
"There is a risk in the numerous informal circles of totally inadequate democratic control of a European security policy, which is why the European Parliament needs to take the lead."
"Its position must be strengthened and this point needs to be entered on the agenda for Feira."
"Mr President, Europe is in the unique position of not having any enemies who threaten it militarily."
"This might therefore be the time for extensive military disarmament in Europe but, in reality, rearmament is taking place."
"Nor is this new military force of 50 000 to 60 000 men to be used within the EU' s own territories."
"There is, in fact, no common defence commitment. Rather, it is a question of operating outside the EU' s borders."
"It is about intervention."
"Some might even go so far as to say that attacks may actually be mounted one of these days."
"I am concerned about statements to the effect that the EU should be able to intervene anywhere in the world where there are threats to the Union' s security, interests and values."
"To me, it sounds as if, in this area too, the EU has the United States' superpower policy as a model for its development."
"Mr President, I too would like to express my great appreciation for the work of Mrs Lalumière, who has produced an extraordinarily sound document which is also carefully thought out. It has been discussed at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and has put us on the right track."
"Mr President, a European Union which cannot play a clearly defined role in terms of security and defence creates uncertainty on the world stage."
"In tandem with the Commission and Council, Parliament would like to contribute to a transparent and convincing policy."
"After all, the European Union cannot escape its responsibility which is commensurate with its economic and cultural stature."
"The Christian Democrats hope that the transfer of tasks and competencies from the Western European Union to the European Union can contribute to this clarity."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council pointed out, this naturally means that the budget of what may be left of the WEU will be drastically reduced but, to our great amazement, he is at the same time quite negative about the idea that the European Union' s budget should increase accordingly in this respect."
"This seems extremely illogical to me and leads me to believe that this development is not taken altogether seriously."
"Mr President, we have emphasised the civil and military aspects of this policy in our resolutions."
"Both play a major role and the military component should explicitly be embedded in the wider context of the civil component."
"These are not just pious words, they also have an immediate implication for the way in which this policy is supervised."
"This is why it is essential that this European Parliament, in which we discuss all kinds of civil affairs with each other all the time, be the place where the military components form part of a wider context in parliamentary supervision too."
"We know that the civil components will always take priority and the military components will in the first instance be used as a big stick and a last resort."
"It would therefore be dangerous if this policy were not entirely supervised by us."
"I also have to say that the nature of the tasks which we have in mind, the Petersberg tasks, is such that here is the ideal place where they can be dealt with."
"As champions of a Community policy, we are particularly keen for the European Commission' s input, as Mr Patten described it a moment ago, to be at its best."
"This means therefore that the Council must make this possible and that the personnel and budget required for this should be adequate."
"Mr President, we do not want to disconnect these tasks from cooperation with North America."
"Obviously not."
"In fact, we are very keen for our security to be undivided."
"This is why it was with some hesitation that, in another resolution, we in the meantime urged that a position be adopted on America' s inclination to determine its own security unilaterally via the ABM system."
"We do not want this."
"We want to cooperate with North America in these matters too, but also - and particularly - with sound backing from the Council."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to the excellent work of our rapporteur, Catherine Lalumière, we are now able to present Parliament' s position in the run-up to the European Council in Feira."
"She has succeeded in describing a really accurate and balanced position with which a large majority of the political forces here in Parliament can identify."
"Thank you, Catherine Lalumière."
"The war in and about Kosovo has made Europeans realise three important things."
"First, that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities."
"So far, we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts."
"If we want to avoid war, we need to give ourselves this capability."
"I am delighted that you, Commissioner Patten, take this same view and look forward to hearing your proposals, the Commission' s proposals."
"Secondly, we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood, even in the case of very limited military action."
"Thirdly: we have learned that we need to be independent from our American friends if we want to control the means to be deployed in a military conflict."
"In other words: if we are dependent on others when it comes to reconnaissance, transport, attacking capacity and other such aspects, then we are fighting their war, not ours."
"These realisations have resulted in the European Union' s at long last tackling and stepping up its efforts to define, organise and restructure a common security and defence policy."
"Today' s debate is the European Parliament' s contribution to these efforts on the part of the European Union as a whole."
"As the European security and defence policy develops further, the Commission and European Parliament are increasingly being sidelined."
"The European Parliament should also gain greater influence on military action through the budget and proper accountability through the Council."
"If the Union only deals with civil and police matters whilst the governments' exclusive remit is military aspects, then the unity of European action is in danger of becoming the first casualty in crisis situations."
"There can be no artificial divide between humanitarian aid and military action."
"The idea of a joint European and national Assembly has not been sufficiently developed by a long chalk."
"Will it need to be more than an informal conversation club?"
"Will it be given competencies at the expense of national parliaments?"
"It should in any event not cause this Parliament to be sidelined even further during the development of the European security and defence policy."
"Mr President, I hope that Mrs Lalumière' s sterling report will this time not only meet with widespread agreement in Parliament but will also be heard in the Council."
"But all too often the Council puts to one side what has been decided within the European Parliament, by consensus or not, as the case may be."
"European unification is born from a desire for sustainable peace."
"This is a leading concept which recurs in many interventions."
"The Common Foreign and Security Policy should therefore forge a unity between political decision-making, conflict prevention, crisis management, possibly military action - only if need be, and ideally not - plus a plan to return to peace afterwards and to keep this peace."
"I am not only thinking of Kosovo, which has been so important to us as an eye-opener."
"The failure throughout the former Yugoslavia has shown that European helplessness and fragmentation between the different governments do not lead to a prospect of joint peace."
"This peace is communal and it should also be maintained communally."
"Mr President, the resolution proposed by Mrs Lalumière seeks parliamentary backing in the form of proposals for the necessary means and structures so that the European Union can assume international policing duties alongside ÍÁÔÏ, especially when and where ÍÁÔÏ fails to act immediately, as specified at Helsinki."
"Unfortunately, this philosophy, as can be seen from the debate, prevails not only in the Council and the Commission, but also in the European Parliament which, instead of expressing the feelings and interests of the citizens, is about to ratify an extremely dangerous policy for Europe and mankind as a whole."
"Not only are we ignoring the blatant crimes committed and being committed in Yugoslavia, we are also being called upon to support the need to repeat them with more efficient means and procedures."
"The following questions must inevitably be asked: who gives us the right, on any pretext, to bomb, kill and trample the fundamental principles of international law underfoot?"
"How should we describe someone who stirs up tension and conflict between peoples inside countries and then uses that tension and conflict to control and plunder the countries in question?"
"But, even if international alliances are still prepared to commit such crimes today, the people will soon form their own peaceful front against these criminal policies."
"I do not congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Lalumiere;"
"I am disgusted by her proposal."
"Mr President, the challenge confronting us is how Europe can do more for crisis prevention and management, and the proposals which we are debating are the only way we can achieve that more effectively."
"I congratulate the Commissioner on the lead he is setting for greater efficiency not only in aid, but also in this area."
"I thank him particularly for his undertaking to examine my proposal for a European public security force, because there are several organisations across Europe which could offer experience, not least the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland."
"I want to address a word to people in London."
"It is reported in the newspapers that certain people in London are saying they would end the EU's involvement in the defence process."
"To London I say: you cannot do that; be realistic!"
"You could possibly end the UK's involvement, but you cannot stop what the European Union is doing. Please face reality."
"This is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating."
"We must try to shape it positively."
"I look forward to further debate on these questions, being Parliament's rapporteur on the Rapid Reaction Facility that we will be dealing with later in the year."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Lalumière, on the report which she produced for our Parliament and in which she managed to strike a fine balance."
"Cologne and Helsinki have added substance to the common European security and defence policy."
"With unusual drive, the European Council has taken a number of important decisions, of which we have taken note and for which we have given due credit."
"The aim is to develop our own capacity in order to be able to implement the so-called Petersberg tasks."
"A decision has been made on the extent of the troops required in this respect."
"A draft of the necessary decision-making mechanisms is in place."
"A small-scale NATO is emerging."
"In this context, I would like to emphasise two incisive questions, which are a small selection from a long series of matters which are being discussed here today."
"The European Union must be able to act autonomously."
"This may sound obvious, but this statement also touches upon an enormous problem."
"What does autonomous mean in relation to NATO?"
"There is some confusion surrounding this on both sides of the Atlantic and this should be resolved soon."
"Autonomy should certainly not culminate in a political exchange between the common European security and defence policy and the national missile defence, as was suggested recently by an American senator during the NATO Assembly in Budapest."
"In summary, the question which I would like to put to the Council is: what is autonomy in this context?"
"Is action within a NATO context always the first option, as the Americans claim?"
"Should NATO be given first refusal before the European Union can act autonomously or will the European Union allow itself more room for manoeuvre?"
"I have the impression that this question is being avoided on both sides of the Atlantic, which will compromise future cooperation."
"The second point is about democratic control."
"In the Netherlands, there has been a lot of discussion recently about who was involved in what decisions in Bosnia and Kosovo."
"This mainly relates to the government."
"But if some kind of policy of faits accomplis is already mentioned sometimes at this level, then what about parliamentary control?"
"Will the common European security and defence policy turn into a cosy intergovernmental get-together or will national parliaments and the European Parliament be truly involved?"
"Here too, the pertinent question arises as to whether the Council pays any attention to this at all?"
"Operating at an informal level has its advantages but not if issues of war or peace are involved."
"The support base required for using the EU military instrument needs to be more extensive than that required for creating it."
"Mrs Lalumière' s resolution contains a relevant proposal for tackling the threat of a democratic deficit in this connection."
"The government conference can benefit from this."
"The least the European Parliament could ask for is to be considered a fully-fledged partner in this very important debate."
"It is disturbing to note the major rush towards the militarisation of the European Union."
"The last speaker said that a small-scale NATO is emerging."
"Many Members, especially citizens in neutral countries, have no say on whether this is what they want."
"In my own country the vast majority of people are against the militarisation of Europe, especially a Europe that will have nuclear weapons at its disposal, a Europe where the arms industries are exporting arms to places around the world where there are mass and gross abuses of human rights."
"If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world, we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem."
"We need to address that."
"With respect to the neutral countries, some of the wording in this resolution is extremely ambiguous in relation to collective defence."
"We in the neutral countries are being told that collective defence is not going to be part of it, but of course when we get in so far then there will be no going out."
"Finally, I was quite amazed to hear Mr Newton Dunn cite the RUC as a good example of policing."
"If you look at the human rights organisations around the world that have amassed damning reports on that organisation, it is incredible to put it up as an example."
"I am sure there are good examples, but the RUC is not one of them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several speakers have referred to the importance of the European security and defence policy."
"I should like to confine myself to the question of democratic and parliamentary control of this policy."
"Peace and security are not suitable subjects for Council meetings in camera."
"They must be subject to parliamentary control."
"It is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments."
"It is also important for budgetary questions and national defence budgets to continue to be decided in national parliaments."
"But everything over and above that, all questions of civil policy, come under the jurisdiction of the European Parliament."
"This European security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this House."
"The President-in-Office has said that transparency and clarity are needed."
"It was clever to pretend that the aim is to integrate the Western European Union in the European Union, which is why the debates currently being held within the Western European Union are so absurd, trying as they are to invent a new identity for the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union."
"Every iota of strength is being used at the moment to define new remits, even going so far as a European assembly for security and defence, yet another committee to add to the confusion, rather than to increase transparency."
"I am reminded of the policy of the Christmas goose trying to postpone Christmas."
"It would be good if more transparency were to reign here and if we were to come to accept that the European Parliament is the right forum."
"We attended the NATO assembly a few days ago, where the president of the North Atlantic assembly stated that the Western European Union was merging into the European Union, that the EU had a parliament, that NATO had a parliament and that the WEU assembly therefore had no further raison d' être."
"I think that is also our position and account should be taken of it at this Summit."
"Mr President, I also wish to congratulate Mrs Lalumière on producing a report which is a fine balance of the arguments and interests involved."
"It is a remarkable achievement."
"I also wish to congratulate the Council on being able to establish at the last summit the principle of the headline goals."
"It is important to realise the significance of these headline goals because for once, instead of spending years discussing institutions, the European Union has put results before means."
"That, as we are already seeing, will drive forward the agenda very rapidly."
"If we are to succeed in our ambitions at a price we can afford, we have to ensure that we get better value for money out of defence and, in particular, defence industries."
"We need a strong, competitive European defence industry."
"Notwithstanding the takeovers and mergers in the private sector, there is still far too much fragmentation in this area."
"We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity."
"The Western European Union Armaments Group, for example, moves very slowly on the basis of consensus."
"Even the six EU Member States which two years ago signed a letter of intent on cooperation have still not agreed a framework agreement to implement that letter of intent."
"We clearly need more urgency in this area and we need a single, coherent framework within which the defence industry can cooperate."
"That is why I am disappointed to hear what the presidency said about the intention to continue with the work of the Western European Armaments Group."
"I believe the pillar structure of the EU provides us with the best opportunity for a framework within which industry can operate."
"Pillar II can provide the common positions on things like arms exports, and we could be working towards a European armaments agency which brings together OCCAR and the Western European Armaments Organisation."
"The Commission has a crucial role in this."
"The last Commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries: there were two communications."
"This Commission has been completely silent on this issue."
"It is as if it is running scared from confronting the implications of its role as the guardian of the Treaties."
"We have to ensure that the single market applies to defence industries as far as possible, and that Article 296 only applies in those areas specified in the Treaty."
"I would urge Commissioner Patten to follow in the footsteps of Commissioners Bangemann and van den Broek to drive forward the Commission's responsibility in delivering an effective and competitive European armaments industry in order to back up the measures we are taking in the political field."
"Mr President, considerable progress has been made towards the establishment of a common European security and defence policy."
"The Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon Councils have all made significant contributions in that regard."
"However, in all truth it must be said that decisions taken at these summits and any that may be taken at Feira will remain little more than aspirational until the Union has the necessary resources to implement such a policy."
"I agree with the recent comments of Commissioner Patten when he criticised EU governments for making ringing declarations which they are reluctant to underwrite with money and staff."
"If Member States are indeed serious about establishing a real security and defence policy then they must put their money where their mouth is."
"In the meantime we have to be realistic about what we can achieve and at the moment we cannot talk about operational autonomy for any European force."
"This will always be relative to our dependence and reliance on NATO which still owns the essential military hardware and which enabled EU governments to deploy their troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo."
"Unless and until we have a sufficient intelligence capability matching that of the US and the transport capabilities to put EU military personnel into world trouble spots quickly, we will continue to need a close working relationship with NATO underpinned by a structured EU-NATO dialogue which is not simply a replication of the WEU/NATO acquis."
"These realities must temper our discussions at Feira and elsewhere as must also the need to keep in mind the status and role of the United Nations."
"Let me conclude by saying I welcome the speculation that the Feira Council will endorse the concept of a rapid reaction police force which would swing into action after completion of military tasks."
"The experience of Kosovo has underlined the need for such an initiative and I welcome the fact that it may happen at Feira."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, a common foreign, security and defence policy has recently developed in the European Union which would probably have been unthinkable a few years ago."
"It has come about because two main groups of members in the European Union have shifted their position: those who believed that NATO alone was responsible for security and defence, and those who believed that security and defence were not a Community affair and should be dealt with by individual states either neutrally or within a pact."
"I think that what is happening today is a positive sign of community and solidarity."
"I also think that, in the final analysis, Article 5, which has been quoted several times today, should represent the common basis for all members of the European Union, even if this can only be achieved gradually."
"Kosovo has been mentioned several times today."
"I think that too one-sided a view is sometimes taken of the lessons to come out of Kosovo and the Balkans."
"In fact, four issues are at stake."
"First, prevention, of which there was practically none whatsoever in the case of Kosovo."
"Secondly, deterrence, of which there was certainly too little in the case of Kosovo, because no common will was visible."
"Thirdly, the facility for rapid, targeted intervention."
"This functioned perhaps to a certain extent, although the fight about what constitutes the optimum form of intervention blocked a great deal."
"And fourthly, the restoration and stabilisation of peace, including after military intervention."
"Developments over the past few days show that it is not as easy as you might think."
"I am particularly thankful that the question of the police and security forces in Kosovo has been raised several times today, because it is essential to establish security by strengthening the presence of police troops."
"There is also the question of developing a system of regional responsibility in Europe which does not fly in the face of the United Nations system, as has been maintained time and again, but which, on the contrary, can be incorporated into the United Nations system and into the ideas of the United Nations."
"Finally, Commissioner Patten has said that we do not necessarily need institutional revolution, perhaps just reforms."
"But we should try for institutional revolution."
"As far as the institutions to be set up in the near future referred to today are concerned, I am afraid that we will paint ourselves into a corner."
"We should not allow too many institutions to exist and the integration of the WEU and the EU forms part of this philosophy."
"Mr President, we are regularly reassured that the measures being put in place under the common European security and defence policy are intended to strengthen NATO."
"This is somewhat disingenuous."
"If this was the intention there would be no need to set up the separate structures which largely exclude the Americans and Canadians and marginalise reliable European allies such as Turkey."
"Over the past five years NATO has already restructured for the specific purpose of facilitating European action should the alliance as a whole not wish to be engaged."
"But this apparently is not enough."
"The real desire is to create something separate from NATO."
"Of course we want to see the Europeans reforming and enhancing their military capabilities but I fail to see how the continued reductions that we are seeing in European defence budgets, most notably by Germany, demonstrate resolve to make a greater contribution to Western defence efforts."
"The amendments we have put forward to the Lalumière resolution are intended to stress the importance of the continued commitment of our North American allies to the security of Europe as a foremost priority, to make it clear that the European Union should only opt to act militarily in agreement with the alliance and when NATO as a whole has chosen not to be engaged, to insist that any rapid reaction force should also be assigned to NATO and in any case should not impact adversely on the capacity of NATO allies to meet their alliance obligations."
"We want EU decisions relating to the use of military assets, including decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy or when implementing a joint action, to be taken unanimously."
"There should not be attempts to create a European armed police force behind the cloak of the common European security and defence policy."
"The Royal Ulster Constabulary is a fine force with a proud record in fighting terrorism but this is not at all relevant to this particular debate."
"Our overall concern is that the common European security and defence policy is indeed a further step towards European political integration and that is our fundamental objection."
"Mr President, honourable members, for reasons of security in Europe and in order to safeguard the security of others outside the Union who may need our support, Europe requires an independent military presence which differs from the presence which it has by reason of its membership of NATO."
"Events in Kosovo and the whole tragic break up of the former Yugoslavia are proof most painful of Europe' s failings within NATO."
"One might even say that Europe has entrusted the task of a military presence to the NATO leadership and, at the same time, relaxed its efforts over the years, to the point at which it is now more or less incapable of properly honouring its obligations within NATO."
"There is a psychological explanation for this."
"If someone, be it a person, a country or a group of countries, considers that it has no initiative to act, it loses interest, neglects its duties or goes through the motions of performing its duties, but there is no substance to them and they are performed perfunctorily."
"Perhaps the most important outcome of the resolutions of the Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon summits is precisely the fact that they have restored Europe' s sense of initiative, giving it the motivation needed in order to accept responsibility, make an effort and honour its obligations."
"From this point of view, the draft which we are debating does not constitute a threat to the cohesion of ÍÁÔÏ."
"On the contrary, a Europe with its own military initiative will take its NATO obligations more seriously."
"It is the only way in which it can take its NATO obligations seriously and reassure the political forces in the United States which object to American armed forces and American resources being tied up in the defence of Europe."
"Consequently, Mr President, we must ensure that our immediate decisions are geared towards European unity and the defence of a common border and, sooner or later, that is the point we must reach."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed resolution on a common European security and defence policy is an important signal from the European Parliament in the run-up to the Feira Summit, a signal which points in two directions."
"First, a declaration of an independent role for the European Union in both civil and military security policy within a clearly defined remit, as in the Petersberg tasks for maintaining peace and peace-making."
"Secondly, a signal to take account of and strengthen the role of the European Parliament in fashioning a common European security and defence policy."
"The European Union needs to make up lost ground when it comes to a common security and defence policy if you think that its defence spending does not even equal 60% of comparable spending in the USA and only achieves 10% of the operational efficiency of the USA."
"The specific undertaking to create a European strike force no more than 60 000 strong in order to complete the Petersberg tasks calls for solidarity between all the Member States of the European Union."
"The lack of any real common foreign and security policy has been exacerbated by the Balkan crisis, which highlighted the weakness of the European Union in this area."
"We cannot double the functions of NATO in the area of global security."
"We cannot build up an expensive parallel structure."
"But completion of the Petersberg tasks must be guaranteed and the principle that security is indivisible must be applied, which is why mutual support, as anchored in Article 5 of the WEU Treaty, must be open to all sides in a revised EU Treaty."
"The idea of attaching Article 5 in an additional protocol to a revised Treaty, to which the individual Member States may accede if necessary, therefore represents a reasonable attempt to find a solution."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, honourable members, it is quite right to make crisis management the main objective of European foreign and defence policy."
"After all, crises all over the planet are the predominant issue at the dawn of the twenty-first century."
"Of course, the current state of the world and the intricacies of the international system also raise other issues and questions which, in my view, form an integral part of the issues and problems which need to inform a specific proposal on European foreign policy."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière because she has taken a huge step forward in her report."
"Not only has she made specific proposals, she has also highlighted the need to find a modus operandi and a modus vivendi for all the means proposed in order to implement European foreign policy."
"The problem with a European foreign policy is not quantitative."
"There is no problem with the figures."
"It is qualitative."
"The problem lies in the content."
"Having said this, may I suggest, Minister, that we act with the greatest caution when it comes to questions such as the integration of the Western European Union or relations with ÍÁÔÏ."
"I, fellow members, shall insist above all on the need to find a system, a modus operandi for all the proposals tabled in the House."
"Because foreign policy nowadays cannot and must not merely be the product of simple intergovernmental cooperation."
"On the contrary, it must be derived by operating a multi-dimensional structure and system within which the parliamentary aspect plays an important part."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a year has gone by since the war in Kosovo, and intensive reconstruction work has begun."
"An enormous amount of valuable property has been destroyed."
"To avoid similar disasters in the future, we are now taking new steps to establish a common European defence and security policy."
"We are doing this in order to join together in creating tools to safeguard the lynchpin of security, namely freedom and peace in Europe."
"I am extremely pleased that this process is going on."
"Within the framework of the EU' s mandate, this joint commitment is now being carried out and intensified."
"I think it is important that the EU should concentrate on what it is good at, namely engaging in trade, developing contacts and taking measures to prevent conflicts. It is also important, however, to create credibility through 'more muscle' and increased ability to intervene in time."
"If (as it wishes, and is endeavouring, to be) the EU is to be taken seriously in the world, it must also demonstrably be able to take more responsibility in its own area."
"It is therefore important that we should create structures which cooperate with NATO, for it is there that the competence, capacity, leadership ability and credibility are to be found."
"The EU has a complementary role, and that is why Mrs Lalumière' s report is so commendable."
"This concept is based upon individual Member States' fulfilling the commitments they have made."
"Our main role in the European Parliament is therefore to exercise supervision."
"I have previously discussed the shrinking defence budgets of the Member States."
"These defence budgets are shrinking at the same time as we require investment in restructuring and new hardware."
"Since we last discussed this subject, Germany' s supreme commander has resigned in protest, which is as good a sign as any."
"If our heads of State and government are to have any credibility in the year 2003, they should not only talk in Feira, but must also then return home and review the responsibilities of each country and the commitments they have undertaken to fulfil."
"Mr President, Secretary of State, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in order for the European construction process to maintain its vitality, which is a prerequisite for its survival, each point of arrival must also form a point of departure."
"Having achieved economic and monetary union, other plans are now being drawn up. We cannot take 50 years to implement these, however."
"This is the case with the establishment of an effective common European security and defence policy."
"The Member States must address this issue from a European perspective which can be fully reconciled with NATO commitments."
"Although this was clearly not our desire, the fall of the Berlin wall has obviously not helped with security and defence in Europe."
"We are therefore now faced with the complex situation in the Balkans, which throws up new problems on a daily basis. The lessons of Kosovo show us how not to act and the challenges in the Mediterranean basin are keeping us alert."
"After decades of a bipolar world, the situation of unipolarity must be transitory and in this the European Union' s contribution will be decisive."
"Peace must continue to be the grand plan of European construction but this will not happen by itself."
"We must therefore have effective mechanisms for managing crises using non-military means, for developing and ensuring the compatibility of the military capabilities of the Member States, for mobilising adequate financial resources in the national and Community budgets and for establishing effective decision-making structures."
"The choices seem clear, the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive."
"Reforms must be implemented, major financial resources and means must be identified, made compatible and mobilised."
"The commitment of the Member States is essential."
"The current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over."
"The Feira European Council must be more than an occasion to reaffirm our desires. It must be a turning point characterised by the identification of the necessary financial resources and by the inclusion on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference of the institutional aspects of the Common European Security and Defence Policy."
"I congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her work."
"- (PT) Mr President, I must very quickly highlight the usefulness of this debate and the importance of all the interventions in terms of better preparing the Council on this issue."
"Mrs Lalumière' s report is excellent, particularly in its balance and the relevance of many of its observations. The report to be presented by the Portuguese Presidency to the Feira European Council next week will dispel many of the doubts and clarify many of the aspects which we have addressed here."
"This report is the result of our commitment to carry out in full the mandate established in Helsinki."
"Regardless of certain differences which are evident here in terms of security and defence cultures, and more so in the defence culture than in the security culture, we believe that we all agree on the need for the European Union to rapidly acquire a crisis management capability at either military or non-military level."
"We must determine the extent of these mechanisms and the appropriateness of these various dimensions in terms which express the different sensitivities indicated here."
"I must mention one specific point which was raised with regard to amending the Treaty on European Union and other possible amendments to this Treaty at this stage in order possibly to enshrine in law the EU' s current military mechanisms. The Portuguese Presidency' s and the Council' s reading of this issue is that there is no need for an immediate amendment of the Treaty and that the provisions of Article 17 are sufficient to cover the current mechanisms."
"In any case, the way is clear for future discussion of this issue bearing in mind future developments and what will be enshrined in terms of the definitive structures."
"As for the EU-NATO link, all the concerns expressed about how the creation of a common European security and defence policy may reflect negatively on the relationship with NATO are unfounded."
"On the contrary, we believe that this mechanism will allow us to independently reinforce a particular dimension without creating any type of barrier in our relationship with NATO."
"Moreover, the mechanisms which we are implementing to link Member States who are in NATO with those who are not and, at the same time, the formulas which we are using to link the European Union in terms of security and defence with NATO partners outside the EU seem to have found the right balance. We hope that the Feira European Council will enshrine these as the definitive model in this area."
"On the issue of parliamentary representation, we obviously appreciate the sensitivity of this House with regard to its greater involvement in these matters."
"However, we believe that this issue of representation precedes that of security and defence and in fact lies at the level of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the well-known claims made by Parliament with regard to its involvement in this wider policy."
"This point has been and is being discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference and we will see to what extent these claims are accepted."
"In any case, it is essential, particularly with regard to the national parliaments, to guarantee their association with any future development in this area."
"We too share these concerns."
"Civilian crisis management has been one of the aspects highlighted by the Portuguese Presidency, particularly bearing in mind the concerns felt within the Council and also expressed in this House about this dimension. The day after tomorrow the first meeting of the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management will take place."
"This Committee was specifically created during the Portuguese Presidency."
"Finally, on the last issue of the Armaments Group, this group is continuing its work and will remain active within the WEU."
"Mr President, it has been an interesting debate."
"We have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it, as one would anticipate."
"I shall be mercifully brief."
"I do not want to come between Parliament and its preprandial democratic duty."
"However, there are a couple of points I should like to make."
"Firstly, there was some discussion about the sort of institutional arrangements that we need to make, not least in the Commission, to cope with the responsibilities of adequately implementing a common foreign and security policy and, in particular, to ensure that we can play our own role in the non-military aspects of conflict prevention and crisis management."
"We need our own crisis units in the Commission, but we should keep that small."
"I want to make it absolutely clear that I have no intention of duplicating within the Commission the sort of structures which are necessarily going to be created in the Council."
"Secondly, Mrs Lalumière spoke very pointedly about the importance of taking decisions much more quickly."
"I am bound to say that is one of my obsessions."
"It is one of my obsessions in relation to, for instance, MEDA regulation and in relation to the Balkans."
"We brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the Balkans."
"We have made proposals about asymmetric trade measures for the Balkans, which are now being considered by the Council and, in due course, will be considered by Parliament."
"We have made proposals for cleaning up the Danube."
"Those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals."
"I hope we can get quick decisions."
"Unless we can take decisions more quickly, before crises happen, then the question of how quickly we take decisions when crises have actually broken will come up a great deal more frequently."
"So in my judgement the importance of taking decisions more quickly is one which is relevant at every stage of our activities."
"The sooner we face up to that the better, not least for the credibility of a common foreign and security policy."
"Once again I thank the honourable Member for her superb report."
"I can only imagine the amount of work that went into it."
"All of us know the amount of wisdom that went into it as well."
"President."
"I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Welcome"
"Colleagues, it is a great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Australian House of Representatives and the Senate, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery."
"I extend a warm welcome to the Australian delegation, which is here to attend the 24th European Parliament/Australia Interparliamentary meeting, taking place here in Strasbourg on 14 and 15 June."
"The honourable Bruce Baird heads the Australian delegation, which is composed of three Members of the House of Representatives and two Members of the Senate."
"The European Parliament and the Australian Parliament initiated their direct political dialogue in 1981 and over the years this dialogue has encompassed a broad range of issues."
"We now look forward to the strengthening of our cooperation with Australia."
"I wish you all a successful and an enjoyable stay here in Strasbourg."
"Vote"
"Mr Perry has the floor on a point of order."
"Madam President, outside the door of this Chamber there is somebody dressed as a cigarette packet."
"I have no objections to people dressing as cigarette packets but I have objections to what I take to be political manifestations outside the very door to the Hemicycle."
"Is this allowed under our Rules?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall just say that the amendments which Mr Dell' Alba has just been speaking about have indeed been deemed to be inadmissible, because Parliament is only entitled to give its opinion on the dates of the part-session as they are presented in the proposal formulated by the Conference of Presidents."
"There is therefore some confusion as to what we are voting on."
"That is why we did not feel that we could deem these amendments to be acceptable."
"On the other hand, all the other amendments have been deemed to be acceptable, and indeed has always been the case."
"(Parliament adopted the calendar of part-sessions as amended)"
"Simplified procedure - without report"
"Initiative of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to the adoption of a Council decision establishing a procedure for amending Articles 40(4) and (5), 41(7) and 65(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders (7217/00 - C5-0216/2000 - 2000/0803(CNS)) (Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs)"
"(Parliament approved the initiative)"
"Proposal for a Council decision modifying Decision 1999/311/EC of 29 April 1999 adopting the third phase of the trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education (TEMPUS III) (2000-2006) (COM(2000)0184 - C5-0231/2000 - 2000/0074(CNS)) (Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport)"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"
"Recommendation for 2nd reading (A5-0153/2000) by Mr Beysen on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the European Parliament legislative resolution on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, with specific reference to a simplified application of the nomenclature of products (14100/1/1999 C5­0134/2000 - 1997/0162(COD))"
"(The President approved the common position)"
"Report (A5-0156/2000) by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (COM(1999) 594 - C5­0016/2000 - 1999/0244(COD))"
"Madam President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to request that the vote on Maaten report be postponed until July."
"Mr Fiori, to make things quite clear, you are therefore asking for the vote to be postponed, pursuant to Rule 146(1) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Is there a speaker in favour of this request and one against?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is surely an extremely important report on what is without doubt a serious issue."
"My own opinion of the legal basis notwithstanding, I really have the greatest respect for the proposals submitted and, above all, for the work carried out by Mr Maaten, who had to process an unbelievably large number of proposals, both in committee and here in Parliament for plenary, in an unbelievably short space of time."
"I think that we shall not do justice to the significance and importance of this issue if we complete this procedure in such a short space of time."
"There are so many proposals - 120 in all - that I fear that majorities will be reached and results will emerge which are not compatible with each other."
"We really do need more careful voting and coordination both in and between the groups so that we achieve a result which is worthy of its name."
"With the best will in the world and with the greatest respect for this issue, we must not forget that we really are not under any pressure and we should use the time available to us for careful reflection and review."
"Madam President, I must state my opposition to this request to postpone the vote. I do not think that there is any shortage of arguments against taking such action."
"I know that the tobacco industry lobby is most anxious to prevent this directive and I think that this request is yet another ploy to prevent a vote, which is clearly a matter of urgency, from taking place."
"I would remind you that the Council postponed its review of this dossier until it had heard Parliament' s views."
"If we postpone our vote, the tobacco industry will gain even more time, since the Council will then not be able to state its position until the end of June."
"Furthermore, I think that Mr Maaten and the Commission on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have produced a good piece of work."
"It is true that many amendments have been tabled and also that in future we will have to make efforts to improve our work so that fewer amendments are tabled in plenary."
"As it happens, however, I do not think that this would in any way justify postponing the vote."
"Everything is in place for a vote to be held."
"(Parliament rejected the request to postpone the vote)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"President."
"I congratulate Mr Maaten and I shall take this opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, to tell you that I have received several letters from Members who would like us to respect the non-smoking areas because they suffer from asthma."
"(Applause)"
"Report (A5-0142/2000) by Mr Berenguer Fuster, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC and 93/22/EEC as regards exchange of information with third countries (COM(1999) 748 - C5­0011/2000 - 2000/0014(COD))"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0144/2000) by Mrs Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs,"
"I. on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directives 69/169/EEC and 92/12/EEC as regards temporary quantitative restrictions on beer imports into Finland (COM(2000) 76 - C5-0137/2000 - 2000/0038 (CNS))"
"II. on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 as regards a temporary derogation for duty-free imports of beer into Finland (COM(2000) 76 - C5-0138/2000 - 2000/0039(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions in successive votes)"
"Report (A5-0159/2000) by Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the European Parliament resolution on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on historical liabilities resulting from nuclear activities carried out at the JRC under the Euratom Treaty - Decommissioning of obsolete nuclear installations and the management of the resulting waste (COM(1999) 114 - C5-0214/1999 - 1999/2169(COS))"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I should just like to point out that I believe that the House has passed an illegal resolution in the vote on the calendar because a four-day week in Strasbourg would only be permitted if there were no additional plenary part-session in Brussels or, conversely, I believe that only if the full plenary week has been exhausted is it legal to hold additional plenary part-sessions in Brussels."
"Please have the legal implications checked as a matter of urgency."
"We have clearly passed a resolution which violates the spirit and probably even the letter of the Treaty."
"Because this could result in our holding one-day sessions here and five-day sessions elsewhere."
"That cannot be the purpose of the compromise."
"Apart from that, it is a huge waste of money to cut a day here and then hold additional plenary part-sessions."
"Mr Posselt, firstly, I am doubtful as to whether this is a point of order and, secondly, bearing in mind that, of course, the Bureau is willing to study everything that is asked of it, if that interpretation were indisputable, the amendment that you are criticising would not have been put to the vote in plenary session."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE - Parliament' s calendar of part-sessions - 2001"
"Mr President, I rise to register my opposition to the amendments of my own Group with whom I am out of step, and to similar amendments, which seek to eliminate the Friday sittings in Strasbourg or to break up one of the weeks of the part-session into two distinct part-sessions in order to artificially increase the number of part-sessions in Strasbourg and even to the amendments by Mr Pannella and company, seeking to remove Mondays and Fridays from the Strasbourg part-session or to extend the additional part-sessions by two to three or even five days."
"All of these amendments are designed to render the Protocol on setting the venues of institutions, which is annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, meaningless. They are designed to attempt to eliminate Strasbourg and to concentrate Parliament' s activities in Brussels."
"By the same token, and out of respect for the rule of law, I voted against the amendments which seek to cancel the additional part-sessions in Brussels."
"It is legitimate to attempt to change the terms of the Treaties regarding our working venues, although it is not an intention that I share."
"To whittle away, however, at the provisions of the Treaty and the annexed acts is a method that is not worthy of the parliamentary institution."
"Mr President, I voted not to work on Fridays in Strasbourg although I am totally in favour of our meeting here."
"I decided to vote not to work on Fridays because Friday was inconvenient for almost all the Members."
"I would like to make the following point: we put in a lot of time but we work inefficiently and we produce relatively little compared with, for example, the Italian Parliament, which meets less often - it never votes on a Monday and does not meet on Fridays at all - yet produces at least 500 laws every year."
"We are constantly wasting time in fruitless discussion and, in particular, with all these votes, resolutions, motions, urgent debates and so on and so forth which, when all is said and done, do not produce any tangible results and undermine the genuine legislative activity which should be the principle activity of a Parliament which is not an advisory body but an organ which adopts resolutions."
"Mr President, I am ashamed to say so but I could not stop myself dozing off a couple of times during the votes which have just taken place and only managed to wake up and cast my vote at the last minute."
"This is because Parliament' s work is not being organised properly."
"I voted for the calendar but I would like to make it clear - as Mr Speroni has just said - that we waste a great deal of time in fruitless activities."
"Voting on the amendments to the recitals of all the legislation, even those which merely lay down guidelines, when all is said done, makes it impossible for us to carry out our mandate."
"Directives and regulations should be produced and voted upon in Parliament, but Parliament must not waste time in other sorts of debates which could be dealt with by the committees."
"Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Posselt and Mrs Flesch have said about this unfortunate vote on cancelling Friday sittings here in Strasbourg."
"I take the view that this violates the Treaty and violates the agreement on where Parliament sits."
"I am really pleased that the ministers in the Council of Ministers and not Parliament continue to decide where Parliament sits and I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will not change that."
"It is hard to understand why we are passing a resolution on a four-day working week when the Treaty refers to session weeks."
"Every employee in the Community, hundreds of millions of people, work a five-day week."
"Once we have a four-day week for everyone else, because the self-employed already work whenever they want, then we can also say that a session week is only four days long."
"I think it is a disgrace, it is a waste of money and as for the ridiculous ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I too should like to endorse the statement made by my fellow Member from the Liberal Group, Mrs Flesch."
"I would like to add something further."
"It is a fact that very few Members of the House are present here in Strasbourg on Friday mornings."
"Nevertheless, I think it is scandalous that some Members want to prevent others from working on Friday mornings. What I find even more scandalous is that these Members think - and I have here an e-mail to this effect from Mrs van Hulten to other Members - that when the Friday sitting is removed, it would still be possible, in spite of everything, to register on Fridays, in order to receive one' s salary, even without having worked."
"I urge the Bureau to be consistent and to also remove the possibility of MEPs' receiving money for Fridays on which they have not worked!"
". The current practice of moving Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg implies high costs for the European taxpayer, and reduces the effectiveness of parliamentary work."
"It undermines Parliament's credibility and political impact."
"The solution to this problem would be to concentrate Parliament's work at only one place."
"We call upon the Member States to consider a change of the Treaty, allowing the European Parliament to decide upon its own seat."
"In order to make this point we have voted for all amendments that aim to reduce the amount of time spent in Strasbourg and increase that in Brussels."
". I have not missed one day in any of the Parliamentary sessions since the election and, I believe, only two in the previous Parliament."
"It is therefore with some hesitation that I voted for the deletion of Fridays from the Strasbourg sessions."
"I have come to the opinion that agendas for the Friday sessions have been engineered to fill up the session and are becoming increasingly meaningless."
"It does this institution no favours when, on a Friday, there are fewer than a hundred Members debating a resolution which is of no importance."
"This Parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions."
"Mr President, I voted for the motion and I would just like to point something out: in Italy, the Schengen Agreement is not always correctly applied."
"I refer, in particular, to the systematic border checks carried out by border and financial police on all those who travel from Italy to a Schengen Treaty country by aeroplane, particularly in general aviation aircraft, or what are commonly referred to as private aircraft."
"According to the Schengen Agreement, there should not be any systematic checks and there should not be any obligation to present oneself to the Customs authorities or notify them that one is leaving national territory."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to take action to ensure that the Schengen Agreement is respected and that the bureaucratic interference of the Italian authorities ceases."
"Beysen recommendation (A5-0153/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for the Beyson report, but this is a classic example of what I was referring to in the vote on abolishing Friday sittings."
"In this document, the European Parliament defines the categories of goods to be taken into consideration in the drawing up of statistics on products which cross the borders between one State and another, although it is not clear what purpose this will serve."
"Is it so that we know how many sweets have passed from Italy into France or how many tractors have passed from Germany into Sweden, for example?"
"This seems to me to be excessive bureaucracy as well as an unnecessary amount of work for Parliament."
"Since we are recording the amount of goods which cross the borders, why do we not also record how many people cross from one country to another within the European Union?"
"But to what end?"
"We must make life simpler for our citizens and simplify our legislation as well!"
"Maaten Report (A5-0156/2000)"
"Mr President, I am totally in favour of this report safeguarding citizens' health, the health of both active and passive smokers."
"But when, in the past, have we ever succeeded in reducing tobacco consumption or cigarette smoking?"
"Only once, Mr President."
"'And when was that?' you may ask."
"In 1848, during the fight against the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Milan. In order to damage the Empire' s finances, the Milanese managed to reduce consumption of cigarettes."
"There we are: we should have written, 'Smoking kills and governments are grateful for their saving in pension expenditure' ."
"Mr President, I voted against Amendment No 54 which would have allowed a derogation from our yield limits on cigarettes exported to third countries."
"All cigarettes are harmful."
"None do any good."
"Smoking is an addiction, indeed a slow suicide, as we have voted, and manufacturers have admitted and known for some time that it causes cancer and other diseases."
"I agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards."
"If we choose tight protection for our citizens we should not allow the exporting of more dangerous products which profit from the addiction of others."
"No man is an island."
"All human beings are involved with each other."
"I cannot condone profiting from the ill-health of third world citizens."
"Mr President, I wanted to give an explanation of vote stating that I had abstained on much of the Maaten report."
"Not because I do not share its health policy objectives, but because I really cannot understand why the Commission and this House wish to pass such detailed regulations at European level, since all they do is destroy our credibility."
"When we start regulating the size, colour and position of notices and pictures on cigarette packets, then we are no longer the Europe in which I believe."
"I disagree with Newton Dunn; it is not a question of double standards."
"But we are responsible for the health of our citizens and we must decide on rules here."
"Other regions must decide on their own regulations."
"We cannot have rules which damage exports, with the result that others will then export to these regions."
"I hope that we can reach agreements with the Council and the Commission here which contain clear, unequivocal health regulations, but not the sort of details which, in all conscience, we cannot decide in this House."
"Mr President, this is just a brief statement to declare that I do not totally agree with the Maaten report either."
"Although I am well aware that we have a duty to give consumers all the relevant information regarding the risks presented by the products they use, I do not feel that it is our duty to adopt prohibitionist laws, particularly where third countries are concerned."
"The report contains excessive statements which are reminiscent of a certain type of terrorist propaganda which I do not feel would advance our awareness-raising operation, also because whenever we go to extremes in these sectors and these fields we obtain the opposite effects to those desired."
"I would stress another point: I come from Italy, which is a Mediterranean country, and I would like to emphasise that the attempt to reduce subsidies for tobacco plantations is a very delicate issue."
"There are a whole range of activities connected to the tobacco industry, which we must protect at all costs."
"Mr President, I share this explanation of vote with Mrs Cauquil and Mrs Bordes."
"In voting in favour of this report, despite its shortcomings and particularly despite the hypocrisy of Member States in their actions to limit smoking, we feel that we are making a stand, within the options available to us, against the right of tobacco cartels to poison the population for the sake of private profit."
"The measures that are adopted should furthermore impose the same restrictions, at least on European tobacco companies, when they manufacture their products under licence, or sell their poison, in the countries of Eastern Europe, in Africa or elsewhere."
"The behaviour of tobacco companies, which runs completely counter to the interests of society as a whole, mirrors the behaviour of all the large oil, asbestos, arms and agrifood companies, which are prepared to run the risk of harming the population or the environment in order to make a little more profit."
"We rejected all of the amendments which sought to reduce the already very limited range of measures that have been proposed or to restrict information on the lethal effects of smoking, because they all serve the interests of the tobacco companies' lobby."
"On the other hand, we support the employees in this sector, as well as small tobacco producers, whose income, as well as conversion to useful production, should be financed by levies on the enormous profits of the tobacco companies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ban on any form of television advertising for cigarettes and other tobacco products in Directive 89/552 and the more stringent labelling requirements for tobacco products introduced in this directive illustrate the ambivalent attitude of the European Union towards tobacco."
"On the one hand, tobacco crops are subsidised to the tune of over EUR 1 billion a year; on the other hand, we are trying to reduce the consumption of tobacco in the Union as much as possible."
"This dilemma must be resolved in the interests of the credibility of Community policy."
"The European Union must set itself the task of pursuing policies which our citizens can understand."
"There is an irresolvable contradiction between the promotion of tobacco cultivation, on the one hand, and the advertising ban, on the other."
"If this contradiction cannot be resolved at Community level, then the Union must fight to help attain a high level of health protection by supporting a reduction in tobacco cultivation at international level."
"Mr President, I have voted decidedly in favour of the amended proposal and of the legislative resolution with regard to the new tobacco directive."
"It is certainly the case that the texts need to be cleaned up because we have adopted quite a few texts which, according to the rules of lawmaking, do not belong in this directive at all."
"Despite this, these texts too are of value because they send out a message."
"They show that Parliament puts public health first."
"Protecting public health is effectively our responsibility."
"Even if we harmonise legislation, public health should not be compromised in any way."
"Public health is not just any old interest, it is of general interest."
"Today, we have proved that we stand for this, and that is how it should be."
"- It was important that the tobacco industry was not able to prevent the vote taking place in Parliament today."
"More than half a million people died as a result of tobacco addiction in the EU in 1990."
"Despite huge lobbying by the tobacco industry, including an attempt to say the process is illegal, the European Parliament will stand firm on public health."
"I welcome the commitment to increase information in cigarette labelling."
"Health warnings will take up 40% of the front of the packet and 50% of the back."
"The industry must be made to give details of the ingredients of the cigarettes, including the tobacco, and just as importantly the filters and additives used to make them."
"Each individual brand should list all additives, not just the prohibited ingredients."
"This must be made public knowledge and not hidden behind a shroud of 'trade secrecy' ."
"People have a right to accurate information on the health risks of tobacco."
"The Greens want to ban many of the more than 600 additives in cigarettes."
"We need to know what these substances are and make sure that they are properly tested."
"Smokers have a right to know exactly what a cigarette contains."
". (EL) No one denies the harmful effects of smoking and no one can object to measures being taken to reduce smoking."
"From this point of view, the Commission' s proposal for a directive contains positive provisions."
"However, although there is serious doubt as to whether the Commission' s proposals will reduce consumption, they will undoubtedly have a decidedly adverse impact both on Community tobacco producers and on tobacco industries and merchants."
"The amendments relating to a reduction in the consumption of tobacco products are no more than a pretext, the sole purpose of which is to reduce budgetary spending (approximately 1 billion euros a year, compared with total tax revenues in the 15 Member States of the EU from the tobacco sector of 60 billion euros a year) and, if adopted, will cause huge and irreparable social, political and financial damage to regional economies, especially in Greece."
"Similarly, the abolition of the three-year derogation for the application of the directive proposed by the Commission and the application of the directive both to tobacco products consumed in the EU and to products for export to countries in which the strict provisions of the directive do not apply will cause Greece tremendous problems."
"- I welcome the adoption of this report on the basis that it ensures the right to a higher level of public health protection and could potentially pave the way for the eventual eradication of tobacco addiction within the EU in the long term."
"If we take the example of the Community's approach to food safety legislation, whereby legislation is based on the principle that consumers have the right to know what they are consuming, then the same principle must apply to tobacco products: smokers should have the right to know exactly what they are smoking and what the effects are."
"We as legislators share the responsibility with the manufacturers of ensuring that the public is fully informed about the dangers of cigarette addiction."
"The recommendations regarding warnings on the front of packages are to be welcomed because they shatter the myth that those products are less damaging to a person's health."
"- (PT) The debate and vote on this report revealed a clear divide between Members."
"We supported those proposals which, in order to protect the health of consumers, did not endanger jobs by preventing European farmers from continuing to produce tobacco and the European industry from continuing to manufacture it. As imports are not being prohibited, the American multinationals would be the only ones to gain from a reduction in the production and manufacture of tobacco in Europe."
"We therefore voted in favour of maintaining direct aid to income in the tobacco production sector within the European Union, thereby guaranteeing greater compliance with Community preference, in order to reduce the share of American multinationals in the tobacco consumption market and to protect the interests of Portuguese farmers, without public health being endangered."
"We also tabled a proposal intended to protect the Portuguese brand 'Português Suave' as we consider that there is no reason to threaten this."
"- I voted in favour of lifting the ban on sales of oral tobacco, so called snuff, in the EU."
"I totally understand that all tobacco products are dangerous to human health and cause different types of cancer and cardiovascular diseases."
"However, I think that all tobacco products, which may have different levels of harmfulness, should be treated in a way that is compatible with the level of danger they represent to human health."
"I also want the different restrictions to be based on scientific facts."
"That is why I tabled an amendment with my colleagues to do the monitoring of health effects by the year 2002 instead of 2005 which was the initial proposal from the Commission."
"This proposal to change the timetable is also very important from the public health point of view."
"Unfortunately my proposal was not adopted."
"I still think that even if the scientific data come as late as the year 2004, this information will be very important for us Members of the European Parliament, when we create future legislation in the field of tobacco products."
"- (DE) I was the rapporteur in this House for the common organisation of the raw tobacco market over 30 years ago."
"In the enthusiasm of youth, I hoped then to convince my 141 fellow members not to introduce a market organisation for raw tobacco which would give us mountains of unmarketable raw tobacco to deal with."
"Had I been listened to then, we would not now be crying over the billions spent on raw tobacco subsidies."
"However, I am not trying here to come to terms with the past."
"Things are as they are and we shall have to live with them, because tobacco farmers cannot reasonably be expected to be left standing out in the rain after 30 years' common organisation of the raw tobacco market."
"We have got them used to subsidies and that has, to all intents and purposes, destroyed our chances of restructuring the cultivation of raw tobacco."
"Now the health missionaries in the House want to stamp out the cultivation of raw tobacco in the European Union altogether; this will naturally benefit imported tobacco - which they cannot and do not want to stop - without, of course, making chain smokers give up smoking."
"There is no question that a lot of people in the EU and everywhere else in the world die from lung cancer, which hits far more smokers than non-smokers."
"But the sort of bans imposing unreasonable demands on the European tobacco industry which the Committee on the Environment has cobbled together with no regard for job losses, especially for women, will not make the citizens of the European Union give up smoking, as the current drastic measures in relation to advertising and labelling have already proven."
"The suggestion that EU manufacturers should be required to comply with the same regulations as regards tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields for cigarettes intended for export to third countries is perverse in the extreme."
"Wanting to accept a sense of responsibility for the health of smokers in third countries is obviously well meant, but when this sense of missionary purpose results in the tobacco industry relocating production intended for export to third countries outside the EU, then all we will have managed to achieve are job losses."
"Measures such as this would result in the relocation of 12% of cigarette production in the tiny principality of Luxembourg alone."
"What is being produced here now is out of proportion and unfair to tobacco farmers and discriminates against the European tobacco industry."
"One cannot shake off the impression that certain people in the health lobby would prefer to exile smokers altogether."
"I am in favour of warnings on packets, but not in favour of a skull which takes up 60% of the surface area."
"I am in favour of a targeted information campaign, especially for young people, in order to make them aware of the dangers of smoking to their health."
"But I am against all the exaggerations contained in this report and am therefore unable to vote in favour of the report as it stands."
"- (SV) To impose a total ban on snuff in the EU, at the same time as cigarettes and other tobacco products are permitted throughout the Union, is illogical."
"The ban on snuff, which applies in all EU countries except for Sweden, ought therefore to be lifted."
"The advantage of snuff is that using it does not affect the environment."
"While smoking causes suffering and illnesses even among people who do not smoke, especially among people with allergies, it is only the snuff taker himself who is exposed to possible ill effects."
"Snuff is addictive."
"The tobacco industry should not, therefore, be allowed to market snuff as something healthy."
"The Marketing Directive, which will shortly be banning tobacco advertising within the EU, must be safeguarded and apply to all tobacco products."
". EPLP Members fully support the main direction of the Maaten Report in highlighting health risks associated with tobacco."
"However, we believe that there are a number of technical areas which will need to be clarified following first reading in negotiation with the Commission and Council."
"The question of tobacco growing subsidy has not been addressed in this report."
"Although many Members feel it is part of the whole debate on tobacco and health and should have been included here, we believe that it would be more correctly brought up in reform of the CAP."
". (FR) Smoking kills: it causes 500 000 deaths every year in the European Union, which is 1400 a day or almost one a minute."
"One smoker in two will die, sooner or later, from a smoking-related disease."
"These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying."
"Surely we need no further reason to support the proposed directive in its current form, quite rightly amended by our rapporteur, Mr Maaten, whom I must congratulate on his remarkable work, the broad outlines of which I have supported."
"Tobacco is not just like any other product."
"It requires specific regulation and it is most apt, in light of recent studies, that the Commission has proposed a revision of the legislative texts in this field."
"Although it may seem naïve to try to eradicate smoking, I think that we can certainly reduce it considerably by providing the consumer with better information."
"We have just declared ourselves in favour, much to my satisfaction, of warnings that will cover 35% of the front and 45% of the back of the cigarette packet."
"Personally, I am sorry that most of my colleagues could not be convinced of the impact that photographs on these surfaces would have had."
"I supported Amendment No 75 on banning the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 16."
"To the anti-prohibitionists, who feel that this ban would, on the contrary, make cigarettes more attractive to young people, I would answer with an ethical argument."
"Our society has the duty, in certain areas, to set strict moral limits."
"It is the whole issue of human behaviour that is at stake here."
"This also raises the whole issue of education and of health education in particular."
"Such education must be started at the earliest possible age, and I think that adolescence is an appropriate stage to instil in young people the limits that they must not transgress."
"On the basis of ethical considerations, too, I feel it is reasonable to ban exports of products that we consider to be harmful to our own citizens to countries outside the Union."
"I voted in the strongest possible terms against Amendment No 54."
"Europe has other assets and other creative ways of finding export markets."
"During yesterday' s debate, some Members raised the point that smoking kills more people than tuberculosis, Aids or other infectious diseases."
"This factor alone is sufficient reason for us to grasp this problem with both hands."
"Mr Maaten' s report is a step in the right direction, but is only one step, because the fight for life, for health, is an ongoing struggle that should engage us all."
"- (SV) The Swedish Christian Democrats have today voted in favour of significantly stricter rules for the tobacco industry, including the proposal that as much as 40 per cent of the space on packets of tobacco products should be taken up with health warnings, compared with the 25 per cent proposed by the Commission."
"We are also in favour of no longer permitting any references to 'light' or 'milder' tobacco, as well as of phasing out subsidies for tobacco cultivation within the EU as soon as possible, for this form of subsidy is directly at variance with the EU' s efforts and initiatives to improve public health."
"Moreover, we wish to abolish the peculiar tobacco derogation granted to Greece."
"When it comes to the continued ban on sales of snuff to other EU countries, we Swedish Christian Democrats consider that account should be taken of the unwillingness of these countries to introduce a new product they consider to be habit-forming and destructive from a public health point of view."
"Sweden ought not, in the name of free trade and the internal market, to force snuff products upon other countries and peoples if they do not want them."
"In the same way, the Commission ought to have shown similar respect for Swedish alcohol policy by having extended and made permanent Sweden' s 1994 derogation concerning private imports of alcohol."
". As Member for a tobacco-producing region, I would like to express my reservations about the proposal for a 'tobacco' directive."
"Nobody questions the validity of its aims: smoking kills 500 000 people per year in the European Union alone."
"We must therefore fight vigorously against smoking, just as we must fight unremittingly against drug addiction, alcoholism and all dangerous addictions, whether they are of natural or chemical origin."
"In this respect, we can only share this report' s proposals, which seek more effectively to warn, make aware and inform consumers of the risks to which they are exposing themselves through excessive tobacco consumption."
"Let us even go beyond labelling or limiting toxic substances by making better use than we currently do of the special fund established under the common organisation of the market for tobacco and to which producers pay contributions in order to fund the research and development of less harmful varieties."
"On the other hand, however, let us be careful not to destabilise too suddenly, without allowing time to convert, a farming sector that involves 135 000 producers and employs 400 000 seasonal workers, in often very vulnerable agricultural regions."
"In this case, there are a few basic principles which I feel must guide our action: we must act fairly against all factors likely to cause addiction, such as advertising and excessive consumption of dangerous pharmacological substances - funded, moreover, from the social security system -and we must ensure that restrictions on tobacco production within the Union are accompanied by the monitoring and restriction of imports so that their effects on consumption are not cancelled out."
"We must give tobacco growers an adequate timescale in which to adapt their production to the new standards for tar content and we must reject any restriction on subsidies for tobacco production unless we replace them with aid as an incentive for conversion."
"In other words, we must ensure that it is not only European Union producers - who supply only 25% of the raw tobacco consumed in Europe - who, without compensation or an adequate timescale, bear the costs of a regulation which is undeniably praiseworthy, but which is too sketchy in the form that has been proposed to us."
". I wholeheartedly support amendments to the Commission's revised proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the EU."
"The new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs, with warnings 40% of the packet size on the front and 50% on the back."
"Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that."
"Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these, half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life."
"As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco, and 85% of lung cancers are caused by smoking."
"Madam President, I would have welcomed the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health, like they do in Canada."
"If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking, go ahead and print them on packs."
"I am disappointed it was not accepted."
"It is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation."
"I am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals."
"They have misled people for far too long."
"At present, warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging."
"Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice."
"The proposal will ban the use of misleading terms such as 'ultra light' and 'low tar' ."
"People have been hooked on the idea that 'mild' and 'low tar' cigarettes are healthier."
"This is simply not true."
"Low tar cigarettes cause just as much damage as normal cigarettes."
"This legislation will spell out the dangers of smoking and save thousands of lives."
"- (DE) I voted against an export ban on stronger cigarettes for the following reasons:"
"The Commission has proposed banning exports of cigarettes with yields of over 10 milligrammes of tar, 1 milligramme of nicotine and 10 milligrammes of carbon dioxide to third countries."
"This would result in a massive erosion of EU cigarette exports and the loss of several tens of thousands of jobs."
"This sort of ban benefits no one, because the cigarettes will simply be manufactured outside the EU."
"But the jobs will be lost here."
"The EU has absolutely no powers to enforce such a ban."
"It has nothing to do with the internal single market."
"The anti-tobacco fanatics should not act as if exporting cigarettes was tantamount to handing out cyanide."
"The EU is acting inconsistently, given that it also subsidises the cultivation and export of tobacco to the tune of EUR 1 billion."
"The EU is using an export ban to act as the health missionary of the entire world."
"That is presumptuous and offends the customs and practices of other countries."
"The right move would be to promote the work on global uniform production standards for tobacco products already begun in the World Health Organisation."
"Unilateral action by the EU will be pointless."
"Berenguer Fuster report (A5-0142/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for this report on the exchange on information regarding, specifically, financial activities."
"But I would like to accompany this vote with two questions: firstly, who inspects the inspectors, and secondly, why does the European Parliament not extend its controls - as I would advocate - to cover all the uses to which the citizens' money is put, including the money used to finance pension funds?"
"The Members of the Pensioners' Party are not yet aware of how the money from contributions which should boost their pensions is spent."
"I feel that this directive should be extended to include this type of inspection."
"Lulling report (A5-0144/2000)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mrs Lulling' s report on beer imports into Finland, but I have to say that I do not agree with these excise duties. For my part, I would like there to be a free market."
"I remember when, at the age of about 21, I worked as part of the crew of a ship which travelled between New York and the Bahamas: whenever I left the ship and ventured into New York City I was allowed to take two bottles of whisky with me, which, as I boarded the bus, would regularly be bought from me at three times the price, for whisky was much more expensive in New York."
"Therefore, this trade between one State and another which was caused by different levels of duties was only natural."
"If we want to avoid it, we must remove all the excise duties in the European Union."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, strongly criticised the taxation of alcohol in Finland in her report, which she considers to be unreasonably high. She also criticised the aim to restrict the importation of beer through derogation provisions."
"In my opinion, the Commission' s proposal is a rather good compromise, however."
"According to that proposal, Finland would reserve the right to abolish the more stringent restrictions on imports from EU countries in stages by the end of 2003."
"Imports of beer from non-member countries such as Russia and Estonia would be limited to six litres up to the year 2006."
"Nowhere else on the EU' s external borders is such cheap alcohol available than in those regions that border onto Finland."
"In my opinion, Finland is consequently justified in maintaining more stringent restrictions on imports than other EU countries."
"Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, Internal Market policy also has to take into account considerations of public health and environmental protection."
"Derogations with regard to Community legislation must be allowed if they are made on the basis of higher levels of health protection."
"- (SV) Finland has been hit by serious problems in the form of a drastic increase in the amount of beer imported from third countries, mainly from Estonia and Russia."
"It is therefore a very positive development that the Commission is now granting Finland a six-year derogation to enable it to introduce a new limit on beer imports from third countries."
"Finland is in that way being granted the right to limit beer imports from third countries to six litres per traveller per day up until 1 January 2006."
"This issue shows that, in the case of Finland, the Commission realises that private individuals' being more or less free to import alcohol across national borders is not only a trade and tax issue. More to the point, it has to do with public health and with a social policy on alcohol aimed at combating the horrors of abuse."
"The Commission might have shown similar insight in its treatment of the Swedish derogations from 1994 concerning private imports of alcohol into Sweden."
"While Finland is obtaining a new derogation, the Swedish one is being removed. In this way, the Commission, together with the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Bolkestein, are drastically undermining the tools of alcohol policy, democratically decided by the Swedish parliament and government and consisting of high taxes and a restriction on imports."
"Vidal-Quadras Roca report (A5-0159/2000)"
"Mr President, I have to say that I was very surprised to find myself voting for this report, for it represents, perhaps, the surrender of the European Union to one of the original Communities out of which it grew, namely Euratom: the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."
"I remember how, when I was a child, one of the books which I found most interesting and which I will never forget bore the title: 'My friend the atom' by Walt Disney."
"Sadly, today, we have to come to terms with the fact that someone has prevented this from coming about."
"And who was that?"
"We should send the multibillion pound bill for decommissioning the nuclear industry to the person responsible, although I still do not know who that is."
"Maybe you can enlighten me, Mr President."
". (FR) The purpose of the programme that we have been debating today is to organise the dismantling of the Joint Research Centre' s nuclear installations and the management of waste resulting from their nuclear activities."
"I do not have any major disagreement with the basic proposal, but I do have questions about this programme' s budget, and the rapporteur has not provided us with any practical proposals on this."
"It is true that he rejected the proposal by the European Commission."
"Let us remember that the Commission proposed that it would finance this operation by using, at the end of each year, unspent appropriations from heading 3."
"To this end, it would use a 'reception' line under the current sub-section B4, which covers energy, the monitoring of nuclear safety and the environment."
"This solution may be satisfactory insofar as it places financing outside the framework programmes for research, a point stressed by the European Parliament, but it nevertheless falls short of what is required."
"We cannot accept the long-term financing of the dismantling of nuclear activities through a 'miscellaneous' line, of an order which is left to chance."
"I must take this opportunity to say that I do not approve of the growing frequency with which we resort to this type of line!"
"I imagine that this is what led the rapporteur to ""take note"" of the Commission' s proposal, without actually putting it into practice."
"The report proposes that we establish a trialogue between the institutions in order to reach a solution but says nothing about the alternative means for financing that have been suggested."
"The most mistaken course of action would therefore be to have the dismantling of these nuclear activities financed by Member States, by methods that still remain to be found."
"That would inevitably cause a backlash in the countries that are not greatly affected by this problem."
"On the other hand, the most suitable solution is the one that seeks to have this programme financed by a self-contained budget line."
"I am quite aware that it is not the easiest solution, because it involves voting for additional appropriations in the review of the Financial Perspectives."
"Nevertheless, we must provide ourselves with the means to achieve our ambitions, particularly when we are talking about nuclear activity."
"In the long term, then, we will have to put pressure on the Council to accept the creation of this self-contained budget line."
"In the shorter term, for pragmatic reasons, we should not obstruct the rapid implementation of this programme."
"I therefore support the following compromise: in the very short term we set up the 'picking up the pieces' line proposed by the Commission, and initiate the trialogue promptly in order, in the medium term, to achieve a vote for an self-contained budget line."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.40 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Special UN conference: Women 2000"
"The next item is the Council and the Commission statements on the outcome of the special UN session on 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace' ."
"Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to tell you about the work carried out at the special UN conference assessing the 1995 Beijing Conference and its Action Platform."
"The Beijing Conference was extremely important in terms of recognising women' s rights and approving an Action Platform endorsed by 189 countries. It established the content of these rights and approved instruments allowing these rights to be gradually consolidated."
"As usually happens with this type of international instrument, it became necessary to assess this given that five years had passed since it was signed."
"This assessment was carried out over many sessions with preparatory meetings initially being held within a PropCom."
"These sessions made slow and sometimes difficult progress in terms of agreeing on certain aspects on which one group of countries, particularly those which are usually regarded as the most developed, considered that progress should be made. There were also some problems in terms of resistance to the language used, not in the political declaration which was approved earlier, but in the final document which was composed of four parts."
"One of these parts concerned the measures and policies to be approved by governments in order to consolidate not only the Beijing Platform but also everything which has been achieved by the various countries in the meantime."
"This process was relatively complex as alliances were established between certain countries, particularly from the European Union, and the South American countries with the result that the G77 broke up at a certain point. This prevented the work from being carried out at a quicker pace."
"Anyway, to summarise as quickly as possible, important progress was made in recognising women' s rights as human rights. Very positive political statements were made in terms of rejecting any violations of these human rights, eradicating all practices which violate human rights, referring to the Commission on the Status of Women and the optional protocol and combating racism and violence based on racial grounds."
"On the issue of violence against women, the satisfactory progress made included the agreement achieved on combating trafficking through international cooperation, with support for actions which are being developed at other levels in the international arena, and also the acceptance by all countries of public campaigns against violence based on the campaign instigated by the European Union on zero tolerance."
"Also discussed were the issues of poverty eradication policies, work as a factor in ensuring the economic participation of women, the essential need to adopt policies reconciling family and professional life and the need to develop access for women to education and training as a basic instrument in guaranteeing them independence."
"There was also, for the first time, a more positive reference to issues of maternity and paternity, usually associated with the male role, and the need for job-sharing."
"On health, the need was noted for a holistic approach in terms of sexual rights and not just in the area of reproductive health."
"Special references were introduced, also on the EU' s initiative, to handicapped migrant women, elderly women and native women."
"The role of men was adequately emphasised, as also was the need to reinforce the participation of women in building increasingly peaceful societies."
"Also addressed was the introduction of an issue which was one of the fundamental instruments in the Beijing Platform, namely mainstreaming from the gender perspective. This must be included in all mechanisms on human rights, in the UN Treaties and at the Millennium Summit and represents an extremely important achievement."
"As for the methodologies for assessing the progress made by countries in applying their commitments, positive references were also made to measurable and well-established objectives resulting in the type of monitoring which allows a more objective balance to be produced, at any time, than that achieved to date."
"Discussions were also held on reinforcing the role of non-governmental organisations in conducting all the policies and as privileged partners of the State in ensuring that the Platform is implemented."
"The basic problems concerned what the European Union has already included in Article 13 of the EC Treaty and the difficulty which some countries had in accepting the issue of sexual rights and its inherent diversity and the issue of sexual orientation."
"In this context, and continuing the strategy defined at EU level of considering that this special conference was not a new conference but an intermediate phase, it was considered that, on these more delicate aspects, the language of Beijing should be used again. The EU took the decision to make a final declaration in which it reaffirmed the progress achieved and its intention to continue fighting to ensure that what for us is already a commitment, given the very constitution of the European Union and specifically Article 13, can be enshrined in future instruments."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to give you the Commission's view on the outcome of last week's extremely important conference in New York."
"I want to apologise for the fact that my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, is unable to be here this afternoon."
"As some of you will know, she was unavoidably delayed by commitments which she had undertaken before the timing of this debate."
"As honourable Members will also know, she is coming to the committee next week in order to have a full exchange with Members, many of whom will, of course, have shared in the success achieved last week."
"Members will be able to follow up any further details in that exchange with Commissioner Diamantopoulou next week."
"I wish to begin, on behalf of the Commission, by thanking the Portuguese presidency for coordinating the Member States' positions so effectively and for handling the negotiations with other delegations so proficiently under what I understand were occasionally extremely difficult conditions."
"We should also thank Parliament for its exceptionally cooperative approach to the special session."
"Members of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities made an extremely valuable contribution as part of the delegation."
"However, beyond that, they took the initiative in cooperating with parliamentarians from the Member States and from associated countries."
"That was an exceptionally useful piece of political coordination."
"We in the Commission also very much welcome Parliament's motion for a resolution: it is a firm, constructive statement of Parliament's commitment to gender equality."
"The European Union can be proud that it was the most progressive regional group represented at New York."
"Collectively we fought hard to move forward from Beijing."
"If we succeeded, it is due in part to the unity of purpose demonstrated by the various institutions."
"And succeed, I think we can say, we certainly did!"
"In a number of areas the outcome document goes far beyond what was achieved five years ago at Beijing - a conference which I remember observing from slightly closer than would have been the case today."
"We managed that without having to concede any watering down of the Beijing Platform in other areas."
"The document reaffirms women's rights as human rights."
"It urges all UN members to sign the CEDAW optional protocol and calls for a strong awareness of gender issues in the workings of the International Criminal Court."
"It recognises that discrimination against women is often compounded by discrimination on other grounds."
"While we did not obtain specific references to all the grounds listed in the EC Treaty, the presidency made the European Union position clear in a final statement before the General Assembly."
"We have new, much clearer language on the state's duty to end violence against women, including domestic violence, and to put an end to the appalling yet growing traffic in women."
"The outcome document acknowledges the link between gender equality and greater prosperity."
"If women are given a chance to participate fully in social and economic life they will be better able to pull themselves and their communities out of poverty."
"It seems to me, with some responsibilities in this field, inconceivable to have a sustainable model of economic development which does not have gender issues at its heart."
"The document reaffirms the prime importance of education as a means of empowering girls and women."
"It also refers to the need for a fair distribution of work between men and women, including work in the home, and for measures to make it easier to reconcile work with family care commitments."
"It also has something to say on methodology - how, in other words, to ensure that these fine intentions are put into practice."
"At the European Union's insistence the document recognises the importance of establishing benchmarks and progress indicators."
"Lastly, we welcome the reference to men's role in bringing about greater gender equality for they clearly have a considerable responsibility as well."
"The Union is better equipped than ever to deliver on its Beijing commitments with its stronger stand on human rights, gender equality and discrimination."
"The Amsterdam Treaty gives the Union increased scope to push ahead with implementation of the Beijing platform for action."
"I hope nobody will doubt the Commission's determination to do precisely that."
"The effort is of course led by my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, but it is an endeavour in which all of us as Commissioners wish to be fully involved."
"Mr President, I thank the Commission, the presidency and all my fellow delegates for the excellent cooperation which we have enjoyed and which has greatly impacted on the conference."
"The conference has shown that, over the past couple of years, we have indeed made progress and we have done so in many areas."
"For example, women are taking part in peace talks, improvement has been made in the field of women' s health problems, employment for women has improved in a number of countries and violence towards women has been put on the agenda in a number of countries."
"As such, we can trace the progress that has been made, although new problems have emerged in the meantime, of course."
"I am thinking of the problem of AIDS in women."
"In some African towns and cities, up to 40% of pregnant women suffer from AIDS."
"There is also the problem of trafficking in women, rape of women during armed conflicts, etc. Consequently, Beijing +5 could not afford to just focus on the progress that was made in respect of decisions taken at Beijing."
"Beijing +5 also had to incorporate a number of new issues into the text, which it did, after a hard fight."
"In my opinion, we have three tasks within the European Union."
"Firstly, as a European Union, we should remain the driving force behind the Member States."
"We played this role very distinctly in the past and we must continue to do so in future."
"It will be evident from the Fifth Action Programme and the financial resources used for this purpose whether the European Commission is serious about applying the Beijing Platform in years to come."
"But it is not only vis-à-vis our own Member States that we have a role to play, we also have a responsibility towards the candidate countries, those which we as MEPs have brought together in New York."
"We have proposed to continue the cooperation with them and asked the Commission, during the screening activities it carries out in the context of the acquis communautaire, to assess the achievements with regard to the Beijing Platform too."
"We also have a role to play vis-à-vis third countries."
"It is dreadful to have to listen to the problems which women face in third countries: genital mutilation, killing if they have been unfaithful or if they had sexual relations before marriage and all these kinds of problems."
"It is the most atrocious form of violence perpetrated against women."
"In my opinion, the aid which the European Union grants to third countries should definitely be conditional on what these third countries need to do in order to solve the problems faced by women."
"Finally, I would like to make it clear that I am a Catholic, but an open-minded Catholic."
"I was greatly shocked by the news that the Church which I belong to has associated itself with the most fundamentalist groups which exist in society."
"It was shocking, mainly because my Church offers so few opportunities to women within its own structures."
"Mr President, the European Union brought women' s rights throughout the world to the fore in New York."
"They were tough negotiations, which is why the Portuguese Presidency deserves special thanks for speaking not only on behalf of the 15 Member States, but also on behalf of the associated countries, with the exception of Poland, as do the Commission and the Commissioner and her negotiators, who worked together with the Parliament delegation in an exemplary manner."
"That is most unusual, so here too special thanks."
"And fruitful collaboration with non-governmental organisations also strengthened the position of the European Union."
"Our unity allowed our opinion to prevail in the progressive countries and to make significant progress in the twelve crucial areas."
"At no time did the European Union brook any watering down of the Beijing action platform, although it is, of course, a pity here that we did not have a resounding success on every count and that the clear language in Article 13 on non-discrimination and sexual rights is not reproduced in the outcome document from New York."
"As already mentioned, we have the fundamentalist countries of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and even the Vatican to thank for that."
"But this should not blind us to the fact that we really moved forward with women' s rights in New York and made significant progress in the areas already mentioned."
"We now have specific measures in place in many countries to combat the cruel practice of genital mutilation, the issue of HIV/AIDS was addressed and the role of women in the peace process, ignored hitherto, was recognised as an issue."
"The fight against violence was put on every country' s agenda."
"Access to capital, the role of men - very important, we would like to see more men taking part in the process - still need to be promoted."
"We tabled our document, our report, in New York as an official UN document, another major success."
"I think the resolutions of Parliament and our progress in the European Union, Parliament' s progress, are now accessible to every country."
"We were very successful with the initiative to invite parliamentarians twice and have speeded up the implementation of the action platform."
"We came to the clear conclusion with our partners from associated countries that we need to work together more closely in order to promote women' s rights."
"We want to have a parliamentarians' conference in two years to review Beijing."
"We insist on another world women' s conference in five years to ensure that the process continues."
"We must all make a joint effort to ensure that the subject of gender mainstreaming, equal opportunities for men and women, stars on the world political agenda."
"It is in our interest to fight for this."
"I think, and this is my personal opinion, that it is also in our interest to fight to ensure that this happens in Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by saying that I am pleased with the outcome of the Special UN Conference on 'Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace' ."
"In my opinion, all credit for this follow-on from Beijing +5, where the implementation of the action plans was discussed, should go to the NGOs, but also to the European Parliament, which was represented by five strong women, and naturally the European Commission, which, in the form of Mrs Diamontopoulou, was 100% committed to this conference."
"Progress has been made, that is for sure, as has already been mentioned by previous speakers."
"The distribution in care, actions against trafficking in women and empowerment of women are important issues to me."
"I am pleased that the participating countries still subscribe to the Beijing Declaration and the action plan."
"It is nonetheless unfortunate that only eight countries in the world have managed to meet the essential obligations which follow on from these with regard to equality in education, paid work and a minimum representation of 30% in national parliaments."
"It naturally gives me pleasure to be able to say that the Netherlands is one of them, although I am not entirely satisfied with its emancipation policy, or rather, the lack of it, and that Germany, the Scandinavian countries and South Africa too belong to the eight."
"But back to Europe."
"In my opinion, it is downright alarming that it is precisely the candidate countries which have shown a decline in the number of female employees and the number of girls registered in education."
"This development merits particular attention from us in the European Parliament."
"Not only is education the best way to obtain gender equality, it is also the quickest way and the only way if we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren will not still be grappling with these issues."
"We should point out to the acceding countries that they need to improve this situation."
"The other point I wanted to raise is the opposition from the Islamic and Asian countries with regard to women' s rights, in connection with which they refer to the sharia."
"I find it downright disgraceful that we women cannot join forces across the world."
"I would ask you to give attention to this."
"It is not just the Islamic and Asian countries to which this applies, but also Poland, for example."
"Finally, I would like to ask you, as I do not have any hard facts at my disposal regarding the acceding countries, whether it would be possible to analyse the status quo in the candidate countries, ideally as soon as possible so that we can assess whether the situation there has improved."
"Finally, I would call for the NGOs, in particular, to be given a key role, because it is they who are promoting awareness, and this is something which needs to be done not only among women, but also among men."
"They need to be involved in this process."
"At the end of the day, we are relying on the political will of society as a whole to commit itself to a cause which is related to democracy and human rights and which transcends all cultures and religions."
"Mr President, I am not now asking for an extra minute in the name of equality, however; I shall try to keep to two minutes."
"I will join that group of people who just said that real progress was made on many issues at the New York Conference."
"Women' s human rights, the trade in women, violence against women, women' s economic rights, the status of civil society: we may be pleased about the progress that has been made in all these issues."
"It is the very determined work of the European Union we have to thank for that."
"We were there as observers, but it is to be hoped that we were also able to influence the way the talks went - at least in some respect."
"It was especially gratifying for me that all the Member States and almost all the candidate countries were talking together under Portugal' s leadership."
"This is a promising sign that we will also be able to strengthen legislation on equality within the context of the European Union."
"I myself do not remember seeing such single-mindedness, and for that thanks go to the chairman and, obviously, the Commission as well."
"The only exception among the candidate countries was Poland, which was not at all interested in supporting the strengthening of women' s rights in the same way as the Member States of the European Union and the other candidate countries."
"I would appeal to Commissioner Patten that when enlargement negotiations are being conducted, serious attention be paid to Poland' s compliance with EU legislation on equality and its recognition of women' s rights."
"I also think that greater attention must be paid to women' s rights in connection with the cooperation that is going on with Mediterranean countries, as it is there that glaring violations of human rights, particularly in respect of women, take place."
"I believe this conference has given hope to all those millions of women who are without fundamental human rights; and we need a further follow-up conference in five years' time."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Presidency."
"I did not participate directly in the New York conference, but the reports I have heard, from participants and in other ways, have really praised the European Union as being very much a motor of progressive change."
"I think that, happily enough, we can declare the Beijing platform for action a success."
"If there is anything which really has had a very secure foundation, it is very much this platform that has been adopted."
"We saw this from the assessment, showing a host of committed women around the world working not only on a small scale but also on an extremely large scale where, for example, violence against women is concerned."
"I should also like to thank Mrs Smet."
"I do not belong to any church and come from a country which has now also separated the Church from the State."
"I want to thank all practising Catholics who are dissociating themselves from the Vatican State, which is behaving as it is."
"If we cannot enter into dialogue with the Vatican State in the future, we shall probably have to question its basis for existence."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the Assembly of the United Nations has once again offered an opportunity to demonstrate the progress made since the Beijing Conference, as well as the problems which remain and which need to be resolved."
"Education is still the most effective instrument for ensuring that women can freely exercise their rights and for allowing greater access to positions of responsibility, both in the workplace and in public life."
"Knowledge of new technologies has been considered to be of great importance in terms of allowing full participation in the society of the future."
"The media is of enormous importance as it can allow women' s voices to be heard, and can transmit an image, without stereotypes, which is committed to society and the quest for solutions to everyday problems."
"Women' s health is one of the priorities of the meeting' s final document, with special mention of the spread of Aids, especially in certain areas of the planet, which affects women in a particular way and requires special measures for prevention and treatment."
"One of the objectives is the eradication of domestic violence, which will be considered as a public issue and therefore subject to national legislation."
"Violence against women and girls will be punishable by law, which means that there will have to be legislative reforms in the countries where it is not yet considered a crime."
"Poverty particularly affecting women must be eradicated, and this is why the countries which have signed the agreement will send 0.7% of their GDP to development programmes aimed at eliminating what has come to be called the feminisation of poverty."
"Globalisation has generated new problems which particularly affect women, such as trafficking in human beings, prostitution and drug-trafficking, which should be combated so that women may live a dignified and free life in conditions of equality."
"All these objectives must be achieved in the next few years and, in order to ensure they are complied with, we are requesting a new meeting within the next five years."
"The fifth programme for equality promoted by the European Commission must serve to promote the position of women, to eliminate the remaining inequalities, integrating gender policies into all Community programmes."
"This meeting has therefore been of enormous importance in terms of making progress in the situation of women in all parts of the world."
"The European Union' s position, given that it has a higher level of development and, therefore, better conditions for women, must not allow us to forget the situation of women in other areas, where daily hardships are combined with malnutrition, extreme poverty and a complete lack of respect for their fundamental rights."
"Mr President, I want to thank the Council of Ministers and the Commission for their respective interventions."
"The Women' s Conference at the UN in New York came perilously close to failing."
"A small group of Catholic and Islamic fundamentalist countries clearly intended to undermine the progress achieved by women from around the world in Beijing five years ago."
"The issues which created the most problems were women' s rights to sex education, free abortion and safe sex in order to protect themselves against HIV and AIDS."
"These issues united certain Islamic and Catholic countries ranging all the way from the Sudan, Iran and Libya to the Vatican, Nicaragua and Poland, which were prime movers in the fight against these rights."
"Some countries attempted to quash wordings about governments' responsibility to protect women from various forms of violence."
"In spite of the fact that, last week, we were in danger of turning the clock back, we eventually agreed upon a final document which looks ahead to progress on the basis of the Women' s Conference in Beijing and, at the same time, marks out the route towards increased equality in the future."
"I should like to point out that the Presidency of the EU, especially the minister Mrs De Belém Roseira, actively contributed to a successful final outcome, something we would thank her for."
"The final document embodies progress in certain respects."
"Forced marriages and murders committed for reasons of honour are mentioned for the first time in an agreed international document."
"On the issues of rape within marriage, right of possession and right of inheritance, together with the right to asylum on the grounds of gender-based persecution, the wordings have been strengthened."
"Women' s right to equal participation in macro-economic decision-making, together with the allocation of quotas with a view to increasing women' s participation in political parties and parliaments are other matters which are being taken up."
"The resolution we are to vote on demands that the institutions of the EU, Member States and candidate States make active efforts to turn the final document from Beijing +5 into a reality."
"It is especially important that all candidate States, including Poland, undertake to abide by the EU' s policy on women' s rights."
"What are now required are economic resources for putting the decisions into effect and inspection tools for supervising their implementation."
"Mr President, the Beijing +5 Conference has not actually made any significant progress in achieving the aims defined in the Beijing 1995 action programme."
"The women' s march for equal opportunities and the affirmation of differences still has a long way to go and is effectively full of dangerous paths."
"This became clear in New York when Islamic fundamentalists attacked what, in recent years, has characterised women' s demands: an end to domestic rape and violence, an end to the right for men to commit crimes passionnelles and an end to female circumcision."
"However, it must, of course, be appreciated - as Commissioner Patten said, moreover - that the Conference as a whole confirmed and consolidated women' s rights as human rights."
"However, similar positions on sexual rights, sexual health and the self-determination of women have caused an unholy alliance - evident at Beijing - to be formed between Christian and Islamic fundamentalists, including the Vatican, Poland, Nicaragua and a number of Islamic countries."
"Furthermore, I feel that mainstreaming and empowerment were consolidated in this Conference, and also the fight against poverty and trafficking in human beings, but that there was an absence of tangible, verifiable objectives such as the need for a greater representation of women in the institutions and also for projects to fight poverty."
"I welcome the positive contribution made by Europe to forging closer relationships with other countries and the NGOs."
"Mr President, the very positive assessment that we are making today of the meeting in New York, should not allow us to forget that there have been serious deficiencies and great hypocrisy, even within the European Union, which make me want to double my efforts from now on."
"An example of this, and this is an appeal to the Council, is the issue of wage discrimination."
"It has been demonstrated that, compared to men doing the same work, women receive 50 or up to 80 per cent less."
"This is not in our legislation."
"Nevertheless, it appears that the European Union approves of it."
"I wonder if the Portuguese Presidency, before the end of its mandate, could make a recommendation in this respect."
"It also seemed extremely important to me, Mr Patten, that in the meeting in New York, when the policy of microcredits was discussed - loans to certain women so that they may be given access to financial autonomy - the countries recognised that these programmes of microcredits had been a complete success."
"Why does the Commission and the European Union, given such a positive assessment, not implement these programmes so that the European Union may also offer its women with no resources the possibility of these policies?"
"Please answer me, Mr Patten."
"Mr President, the European Parliament' s delegation played a magnificent role with regard to the candidate countries."
"Our work has been outstanding in this respect."
"I do have reservations with regard to Poland, but precisely because Parliament' s delegation played such a significant role."
"Mr Varaut, you are very badly informed. You have made a fool of yourself."
"You were not in New York, but I was."
"Your information is not accurate. It is not even true."
"Your intervention is very unfortunate because it is false."
"I have to refute what you have said because none of it is true."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the Portuguese Presidency, in particular Minister Maria de Belém, and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Diamantopoulou, for their guidance and coordination work both at the preparatory stage and during the Conference, for this allowed the European Union to make a substantial contribution to the production of the final document."
"It has already been said many times: the work carried out by the UN and in New York has demonstrated clearly that some progress has been made since Beijing."
"Women are no longer regarded as merely vulnerable people who need to be protected but as the social protagonists of change and as an essential part of society' s resources."
"The need to continue the fight against all forms of discrimination on grounds of gender, race, ethnic origin, religion, age, disability and sexual orientation, which are still rife throughout the world, has become clear."
"The need has become clear for governments to include a gender aspect in all government policies, from employment to development, from social policies to the fight against violence."
"There is an evident need to continue to step up dialogue and cooperation with autonomous women' s organisations in civil society, politics and the institutions."
"A number of challenges remain at national and international levels and for the European Union, particularly in the context of its development cooperation policy."
"In this regard, I would like to draw Commissioner Patten' s attention to the Commission' s frequently negligent attitude towards the adoption of drafts which provide for the involvement of women on development cooperation with Mediterranean countries."
"Poverty affects women more than anybody else."
"Therefore, we need to focus on clear policies which fight the social exclusion of women and consolidate their role as active protagonists of political change and economic development."
"If globalisation is to provide new opportunities, it must include globalisation of the human rights of all people, globalisation of fairness and globalisation of equal opportunities."
"Development must be regarded as a project to expand the freedoms which all human beings have the right to enjoy."
"Therefore, the need for recognition of rights without any discrimination must be a priority both for us and for the international organisations."
"Mr President, the World Conference on Women, which was held five years ago, meant a breakthrough at the time in the worldwide recognition of women' s rights as an area of human rights autonomy and empowerment."
"In contrast to this, I have mixed feelings about the UN Conference which was held in New York last week."
"On the one hand, it was confirmed that it is up to governments to guarantee equal rights for women and to pursue sound emancipation policy, and, despite many people' s fears, no retrograde steps were taken."
"On the other hand, it was once again impossible to reach agreement on sensitive issues which had not been resolved at Beijing, such as the recognition of the right to self-determination for women in their personal life, including their free choice in pregnancy and sexual behaviour or sexual preference."
"This is greatly disappointing."
"Actual equality and freedom for women is only possible if all options are open to them and if the traditional family image is not held up to them as the only true one."
"Resistance of the kind displayed by governments, diplomats and officials last week, is a form of rearguard action, however."
"It is impossible to stop a revolution with clever word games and little schemes behind the scenes."
"The fight goes on."
"The true inspiration which I gained from last week' s conference in New York lay in the power of the international women' s movement which, contrary to popular belief, is as vigorous and alive as ever and is also bolstered by a new generation of young women who, strong and well-informed, stand up for all kinds of issues."
"The European Union and Member State representatives showed great commitment during the Conference to the issue of sexual self-determination for women and the non-discrimination principle pursuant to Article 13."
"The fact that this did not end up in the final document should not be a reflection on them."
"What can, however, be expected of the Council and Commission, is that they put their money where their mouths are in their respective Chambers."
"In addition to what we obtained last week, namely reparative legislation on equality in work and professional life, they should produce new additional legislation to prevent sex discrimination across the entire range of social life."
"Article 13 offers the opportunity to do so and the Beijing +5 Conference issued an instruction to this effect."
"Surely a European Union which, at international conferences, is full of rhetoric on banishing sex discrimination should set about developing effective policy instruments which can attain this goal at the level of the Union itself."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"Many friends and women who are colleagues in this Parliament have just pointed out that my name appears as one of those who signed against women's rights."
"I want to put on record that I am not against women's rights."
"I have always supported women's rights."
"It must be an error."
"Sometimes colleagues bring petitions from delegations and we sign them."
"I am sorry about that."
"That was not a point of order, Mr Khanbhai."
"You mentioned a matter which has not been raised by anyone. There has been no reference during the debate either to your name or to a list of reprobates."
"I really do not know what you are talking about."
"President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure you will understand the pride I feel as a Portuguese national at the general acclaim for the Portuguese Presidency' s excellent work in promoting equal rights for women during its term and particularly with regard to the special UN conference on Beijing+5."
"The conferences on violence against women, trafficking of women and reconciling family and professional life, together with the UN conference on Beijing+5, are clear examples of the Portuguese Presidency' s involvement in this area."
"Anyone at the UN last week, like myself, would know that, in the end, we only managed to approve less than one-third of the final document."
"The difficulties were immense. I feel that it was both the work of the Presidency and the Commission and the involvement of all the female Members of this House who were there, and who joined with the national MPs of the Fifteen plus those from the applicant countries with the exception of Poland, which ensured that progress was made in the final document and that this was a lot closer to our intentions than when we started the work."
"Finally, I must say that the European Union has a decisive role to play in this issue."
"We must lead the way in defending women' s rights and we must continue the work in this respect."
"The resolution approved by the European Parliament was greatly appreciated in the UN."
"I must thank the President-in-Office for having come directly from Canada to Strasbourg so as not to miss this meeting which is so important to us. I know that, since Monday of last week, she has been constantly dealing with women' s issues both in the USA and in Canada."
"I must also say very sincerely and with immense gratitude that the conduct of this work in this way was only possible because we all - the Presidency, the Commission, the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations - cooperated together. This was also possible because the bilateral contacts which we each maintain, by working hard at them and thereby multiplying their effectiveness, were vital in the end result."
"I am extremely grateful to everyone for this."
"When I spoke, it was clearly on behalf of all the Member States of the European Union and of all the applicant countries except for Poland."
"In the contacts established with Poland, it has been made very clear that accession cannot be exchanged for non-recognition of women' s rights."
"The European Union could not take any other position on such an issue. Women will no longer accept their fundamental rights being regarded as a bargaining chip for political issues."
"Europe must continue to be the driving force in developments in this area. These must be achieved through cooperation, particularly with all like-minded countries, some of which, like Canada, are totally committed to the Presidency' s statement presented at the end of the special conference."
"We must take advantage of all these opportunities."
"These developments must also be achieved through benchmarking processes and by using the conclusions of the Lisbon Special Summit, which considered that in Europe there could be no economic development without social cohesion."
"In this way the European Union itself can develop and export these instruments for assessing, measuring and exchanging good practices enabling gradual and effective progress to be made."
"I referred to the Portuguese Presidency' s work on the issue of discrimination in the European Union. Portugal is also very pleased that, in the last Social Affairs and Employment Council, a resolution was approved on reconciling family and professional life."
"Women are constantly being penalised because the time that they devote to family life gives employers objective reasons to discriminate against them in wage terms."
"Therefore, in my opinion, we have already achieved what was asked of us."
"Finally, I must thank the President and the whole House for your kindness and the comments which you have made, and I also thank the Commission for its support."
"The Portuguese Presidency is now coming to an end and sincerely hopes that the subsequent French and Swedish Presidencies will continue the work which we have together managed to achieve so that they represent the next stage in the consolidation of women' s rights."
"Thank you, President of the Council. We all share this hope."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received four motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, following the intervention by my colleague in seat No 662, here, in Parliament, I have asked for the floor on a point of order because this fellow Member has obviously fallen victim to misinformation or to a misunderstanding."
"In fact, the Members of the European Parliament who were in New York as part of the European Union delegation, which comprised 15 people with observer status, were not allowed to speak because, in accordance with the UN' s procedure for extraordinary general assemblies, the Portuguese Presidency spoke on behalf of the European Union."
"The Commissioner was entitled to give a speech in the plenary session."
"Even in the working parties, we were not allowed to take the floor, which was always given to the Portuguese Presidency."
"Do not, therefore, put words into the mouths of the Members of this Parliament who were in New York."
"In no instance did we speak in an official capacity, still less on behalf of this Parliament, although we did have some useful discussions with the Commission and the Council, with Members of the Parliaments of Member States and associated States, who allowed us to convey our views."
"What were banned from these meetings were the positions that Parliament adopted under the Smet/Gröner report, and nothing else."
"Mr President, Poland' s name has been bandied about a great deal, so I must say that we simply stated that Poland is accepting the acquis communautaire."
"If Poland tells us that it is free..."
"(The President cut the speaker off) I do wish to point out that a fellow Member has accused us, Mr President, and I must be entitled to correct this, otherwise this is not a genuine Parliament."
"You may hear my explanation of vote tomorrow, Mr President, if you are going to cut me off."
"Mrs Lulling, we have already heard speeches on the matter from the President of the Council and from the Commissioner on the subject of Poland."
"You were speaking about a point of order."
"Mr Izquierdo Rojo had already replied to Mr Varaut and therefore, Mrs Lulling, you could not use your speech on a point of order to discuss the issue."
"You have, of course, prompted Mr Varaut to ask to take the floor for personal reasons."
"You are quite right, Mr President."
"In short, I agree completely with the need for a full debate in this Chamber, even if we do not all agree."
"Next, having heard what most of the speakers said on the issue of Poland, I am left in no doubt as to many of the things said in corridors and about the pressure of which I was informed, which was brought to bear on the representatives of Poland, a free State."
"To conclude, I have heard many things said about the Vatican, but I can see that Jesuitical thinking, at least, has truly pervaded the European Parliament."
"Mr Varaut, we cannot base our debates on corridor conversations. These are not reliable sources of information and are not available simultaneously to all Members in all languages."
"The corridors are there specifically for private, informal conversations, not official debates."
"Tunisia - Human rights - EU-Tunisia Agreement"
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Da Costa, we are approaching this debate, as we approached the questions we put to the Council and the Commission, aware of the responsibility entailed in our partnership relationship with Tunisia, which we consider will be decisive for the success of the entire Euro-Mediterranean Partnership."
"In fact, Tunisia is the first country with which the European Union signed an Association Agreement within the context of the 1995 Barcelona Process."
"We attach great importance to preserving and consolidating this Agreement, and I would like to make it quite clear that, as far as we are concerned, there is no question about this."
"On the other hand, it is true that we are following the development of the situation in Tunisia closely and with a sense of involvement, and we appreciate the positive factors such as economic and social progress, which we do not deny, particularly in relation to the region' s situation and the role played by Tunisia in the Arab Maghreb."
"We do not, therefore, intend to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country at all, and it will be more useful if today' s debate serves to bring about renewed commitment on both sides to the values and undertakings entailed in our partnership."
"However, in all honesty, I must also say that we are extremely concerned about the human rights situation in this country, particularly because we are convinced that, given the socio-economic and cultural context involved, there is the possibility for substantial improvement in the degree of freedom of the press, of speech, of association and of movement, conditions in prisons and the autonomous exercising of justice, so that the country can move towards full expression of the rule of law."
"And this is the moment to do so."
"This is why we call upon the Commission and the Council to support this process by joining us in making representations to the Tunisian authorities."
"We must not forget that the creation of a free trade area is not the sole objective of the partnership policy, nor, moreover, that the partnership does not just consist of an exclusive relationship between the governments but has to ensure support and due respect for civil society, for the autonomous associations which uphold human rights and freedoms and for the role of women, whose lives in this country are full of sacrifices and who are often at great risk and undergo indescribable suffering."
"For our part, we must prove that the Euro-Mediterranean policy is a priority for the Union as a whole and that it is not based on the egotism of those of us who are motivated by the desire to conquer new markets for our goods or obtain cheap labour for our businesses."
"It is also based on shared values, on respect for cultural, religious and linguistic differences, and on policies capable of producing prosperity and security for the entire Mediterranean area."
"Today, may this debate serve to remind us and our partners of all these things."
"Why is Europe silent about human rights in Tunisia?"
"Is it on account of the stability and economic progress which this holiday destination enjoys?"
"Is it because of the political links with France or the European socialists?"
"Or because it has adopted a constructive stance in the peace process in the Middle East?"
"Or do we see Tunisia mainly as a bulwark against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism?"
"At any rate, President Ali only has the religious fanatics in mind."
"He seems to be obsessed by them."
"But this concern is more of an alibi than a justification for the human rights situation in his country."
"Not only Muslim fundamentalists, but all political opponents are systematically silenced."
"Tunisia calls itself a democracy, a democracy without opposition that is, without freedom of the press, without fair judicial processes and with torture and the elimination of political prisoners and their families."
"Tunisia has concluded an association agreement with the European Union which contains a clear human rights clause."
"There can, of course, be no question of President Ben Ali' s claiming rights under the agreement but shirking his obligations under it."
"If the violations continue, the Treaty will unfortunately need to be suspended."
"Would Commissioner Patten agree with me there?"
"Tunisia is the first Mediterranean Sea partner with which this association agreement has been concluded. Given its economic development, it can act as a model for the entire region, but it should then, of course, meet the political criteria."
"The European Union cannot allow one agreement partner that which it denies another."
"The Association Council must, therefore, look into the human rights situation as a matter of great urgency and draft a democratisation programme."
"If the European Union keeps quiet any longer, it will be partly responsible for the human rights violations in Tunisia."
"Mr President, in March, the Delegation for Relations with the Maghreb countries and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which I am vice-chairman, made a visit to Tunisia, where we observed that, while there has been undeniable economic progress, there exists a democratic deficit in the field of freedoms, particularly in the area of the press and the audiovisual media."
"We were also able to observe - and I think this should be stressed - that the Tunisian authorities are aware of this deficit, which they justified time and time again through the need to temper their political openness in accordance with their particular idiosyncrasies and culture as well as the danger to Tunisian society of the growth of Islamic fundamentalism."
"They therefore asked for understanding and patience."
"I must say that the Tunisian Government has made gestures which indicate goodwill. They made these gestures during our visit and this is reflected in the report which the delegation has presented to Parliament."
"In the view of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats and European Democrats), we are therefore holding a debate which is necessary but which should not take the form of an exaggerated and alarmist condemnation, which is often what happens, but which should recognise certain facts which concern us because they affect the areas covered in the association agreement, such as the respect for human rights and democratic principles. This issue must be resolved by means of political and social dialogue, and an effort on the part of the Tunisian Government to implement legislation which will guarantee political pluralism in a real sense and not in a purely formal sense and, above all, provide the necessary freedom so that the citizens can express their opinions and the media can reflect them."
"This is the message which this House must send to the Tunisian authorities, who must receive them in the positive light in which they are intended."
"To this end, within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, the Commission, the Council and Parliament must not go into reverse with regard to the aid programmes which must be implemented within the framework of MEDA II."
"Education and training in democratic principles are a fundamental element of sustaining a plural and democratic society."
"Young people, judges, the police and journalists need to have full knowledge of the rights they must exercise and defend."
"This is the area in which the European Union can and must cooperate."
"It also concerns me that Commissioner Patten, who is present, is not sufficiently sensitive to the serious problems currently faced on the southern side of the Mediterranean, where Tunisia plays a very important role."
"Emigration, fundamentalism, poverty and political instability cannot be resolved by pronouncements and good intentions alone."
"We need true political will and the economic and human resources to put it into practice."
"In any event - and this could serve as a summary of the debate - we cannot restrict our cooperation with third countries to purely trade and economic issues."
"To this end, we also ask Tunisia, together with economic reforms, also to make progress with political reforms aimed at guaranteeing freedoms, but with the aid and cooperation which, of course, they receive and will continue to receive from us, at least from my Group."
"We also believe that we need a common strategy in the Mediterranean, as the resolution states, and that, together with political, social and security aspects, special attention is paid to the cultural and human dimension."
"This is why we need to strengthen the interparliamentary dialogue and the dialogue with the representatives of civil society."
"As we say in my country, By talking we come to understand people' ."
"If one thing characterises the people of the Mediterranean, it is the wealth of their thought and their words, and that, ladies and gentlemen, costs very little."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we start to examine an issue like this we should remind ourselves of the European Union' s general attitude to its external relations."
"The EU has a set of values and principles which it naturally tries to promote in its relations and which it tries to use in all areas of its associations with third countries."
"Contrary to what may be inferred from one honourable Member' s intervention, the European Union does not act according to geographical position by being more demanding on countries which are closer and less demanding on countries which are further away."
"We do not work in this way."
"We usually use uniform criteria and, in particular, the idea that it is preferable to open areas for dialogue in order to encourage countries to make regular bilateral assessments of what is causing exclusion factors or misunderstandings."
"In this respect, the work of the Council and Commission is totally coherent. In particular, and I do not really need to say this, Commissioner Patten has more credentials than most of us on the issue of respect for human rights."
"On the specific issue of Tunisia, I must say that the Council is fully aware of the human rights situation in this country. It has noted all the concerns expressed on various occasions by this House."
"Naturally, it has also noted the considerable concerns expressed here today."
"The Council has on several occasions emphasised to the Tunisian authorities its concern about the occurrence of certain situations, particularly the lack of general freedom and press freedom in particular."
"Human rights issues are frequently discussed, as the speakers have noted, within the political dialogue which the Council is conducting with Tunisia within the Association Council and through the Heads of Mission of the Member States in Tunis who have regular meetings with the relevant Tunisian government officials in this area."
"At the moment this dialogue is centred specifically on the current reforms of the new press law, the operation and functions of the penalty enforcement judge and the amendments of electoral law."
"The possibility of such a dialogue, which Tunisia did refuse for some time, represents significant progress."
"During the two meetings of the Association Council which took place as part of our relations with Tunisia and which I attended, the Council reiterated the fundamental importance to relations between the European Union and Tunisia of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and, naturally, it used the opportunity to highlight certain specific cases, some of which have been mentioned here."
"On a more national note, during the State visit by President Ben Ali to Portugal at the beginning of May, the Foreign Minister, Jaime Gama, had the opportunity to raise with his Tunisian counterpart the human rights situation in Tunisia and in particular the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick. He underlined the constant need to respect fundamental freedoms."
"We realise that any kind of action in terms of political pressure can have advantages where carried out through the media."
"We believe that there is room for several dimensions to be used in the international arena on this type of issue and we do not reject the efficacy of these actions."
"However, the Council prefers to use the opportunities for influencing the Tunisian authorities more discreetly, and perhaps more effectively, by maintaining constructive pressure on them through political dialogue and various meetings at different levels."
"We do not consider it appropriate to initiate the procedures needed to suspend the Association Agreement or to convene an extraordinary session of the Association Council which would probably be reported in the media but which would have no practical effect in specific terms."
"Maintaining regular dialogue and continuing all the steps which have been made so far, when and if appropriate, is the right way to proceed in this context."
"Despite these difficulties and the problems in moving this process forward which we all recognise, we must accept that there have been positive results."
"We cannot ignore, and it would be politically incorrect to so do, the gestures of openness already made by Tunisia, particularly in freeing 600 political prisoners, returning passports to certain members of the opposition and being clearly willing to reduce tensions in the case of the journalist, Taouffik Ben Brick, and accepting his specific claims."
"The Commission has also tried to finance actions in order to promote human rights and democracy in Tunisia through the MEDA programme for democracy and may provide further information in this respect."
"Finally, in the Barcelona Declaration, Tunisia, like the other Mediterranean partner countries, signed up to certain principles involving respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Within the EU-Mediterranean framework and in reinforcing this framework as we are trying to do at the moment in close cooperation with the European Commission, we are also insisting on the importance of actively promoting the rule of law and the good management of public affairs which constitutes a key area in the dialogue between the two sides of the Mediterranean."
"To conclude, I must assure you that the Council remains committed to promoting and reinforcing in Tunisia, as in other countries with which the EU maintains relations, respect for human rights, democratic principles and fundamental freedoms, and to establishing a true democracy with an open civil society based on a rule of law."
"A measured policy is, in our opinion, the best way to achieve these objectives."
"The Council will continue to pursue discreet but firm diplomacy and will continue its policy of encouraging all forms of progress towards democracy and the rule of law."
"I am extremely grateful to the House for the opportunity to comment on these extremely important matters."
"As a number of honourable Members have noted, Mr Taoufik Ben Brik's hunger strike is over, but it has had a major impact both on the authorities in Tunisia and on civil society."
"It sparked a public debate in Tunisia on the human rights situation in that country."
"I want to make it clear that the Commission shares the view of the UN Special Rapporteur who states in his report to the Commission on Human Rights that: ""Tunisia still has a long way to go to take full advantage of its favourable economic context and adopt measures designed to strengthen the protection of human rights and, in particular, the right to freedom of opinion and expression""."
"But how can the Commission and the European Union in general influence Tunisia's rate of progress in this area?"
"This is best done by looking at the three main instruments provided by the association agreement linking the European Union to Tunisia."
"The first, to which my colleague referred, is political dialogue."
"This dialogue has already given us the opportunity to comment on Tunisia's human rights situation twice at ministerial level at the two Association Councils that have taken place to date."
"The Union has made a point of addressing the human rights issues in Tunisia in our many contacts with the Tunisian authorities."
"The second instrument is the financing of positive measures in the form of grants from the Community budget for projects promoting the exercise of political and civil rights."
"The MEDA programme for democracy, on which Parliament has strong and positive views, has financed training, information and awareness-raising projects for NGOs and for public opinion in this field."
"A programme of support for the Tunisian media has already been included in the programming of future financial cooperation with Tunisia and should be the subject of necessary consultations with the Tunisian Government."
"As Mr Dupuis reminded us, sustainable economic development and political stability depend, above all, from Russia to the Mediterranean, on strong institutions, not on strong men."
"It sometimes requires strong men to ensure that the institutions themselves are strong and operate within the rule of law."
"The third instrument is the European Union's option of adopting restrictive measures, the most radical of which would obviously be the suspension of cooperation."
"The Commission considers that, before having recourse to any restrictive measures, positive means offered by the partnership should be pursued to the limit."
"There is still significant scope both at the level of political dialogue and the financing of support programmes."
"I would like to explore this further with Tunisia."
"Specifically, the Commission wishes to see to what extent the Tunisian Government will implement its promises regarding reform of the press code and facilitating freedom of association."
"We also wish to see if our efforts to support the desired reforms by providing funding from the Community budget prove successful."
"I will keep Parliament informed of developments in all these areas."
"The issues that we have been discussing this afternoon are extremely important."
"I know that Parliament is aware of the whole picture."
"Mrs Napoletano, in her interesting address, pointed out the economic and social progress that has been made in Tunisia."
"Others could have referred, for example, to the position of Tunisia on the sharia law."
"Nevertheless, there are issues which give considerable cause for concern."
"It is best at the moment to proceed by dialogue but, as the House will understand, I do not equate dialogue with being supine."
"Parliament has legitimate concerns and a strongly felt point of view."
"That can be expressed firmly but courteously, as Parliament is doing today."
"I want to put the debate on Tunisia in context and to take up a point that was made by Mr Hernández Mollar and some other honourable Members as well."
"Of course there will be events and developments that crowd in on us."
"Today, inevitably, we have to give a good deal of attention to our efforts to rebuilding in the Balkans and, in particular, to prevent further social and political disintegration."
"It is a policy in south-east Europe which, I should add, is not irrelevant to stability and prosperity in the Mediterranean."
"But if I have to judge where we are going to face the main challenge in the medium and longer term, it would be, to be candid, our policy in and around the Mediterranean."
"What is at the heart of the Union's common foreign and security policy?"
"It is the projection of stability."
"That is the crucial element in our policy in the Mediterranean."
"What are we trying to do there?"
"It is true that we are trying to create, if you like, the Mediterranean equivalent of NAFTA."
"But there is more than that, which I will come to in a moment."
"I just want to make it clear to the honourable Member that my commitment to making this policy a success is total."
"One of the things that most offends me at the moment is that our record in supporting it through development assistance is not nearly as good as it should have been."
"For year after year we have only been able to spend 40% or less of what we have committed in the Mediterranean, partly because of absorption problems in the region, partly because of our own failures, which I am keen to address."
"I will make this bargain with the honourable Member: if, by the time I leave my job as a commissioner in 2005, our record in closing the gap between commitments and payments is not a hell of a lot better than it has been in the last three years then he can have a contribution to his favourite charity."
"That is what I would like to be taken as a mark of whether or not we are committed to making a success of our policy in the Mediterranean."
"It is extremely important that we use our existing instruments much more competently, much more effectively."
"That is what I would like to be judged on."
"I want to repeat: this is not just about creating a free trade area, important as that may be."
"Free trade is not the end; free trade is a means to an end."
"The end is the creation of an area of prosperity and political stability to the south of the sea that we have shared with North Africa and the Middle East for all these millennia; it is about the sharing of values, as well as the sharing of trade."
"It is not about creating hub economies which will make Europeans more prosperous: it is about working in partnership with Mediterranean countries in a partnership of values as well as trade, for the good of people to the south of the Mediterranean as well as those of us in Europe."
"It is an enormously important part of Europe's endeavours over the next few years; as important, in some ways in projecting stability, as the whole process of enlargement."
"I very much hope that in the next five years we will be able to carry that programme forward in Tunisia and the rest of the region."
"Mr President, one of the best pieces of theatre criticism to be published in Europe in the 20th Century, in my humble opinion, went something like this: 'Yesterday was the opening of such and such a play, by such and such a writer' ."
"I could not hope to emulate the crushing brevity of this, in my view, brilliant journalistic comment."
"However, my question is practically the same."
"Why are we arguing about the situation in Tunisia?"
"Why is there a certain crisis in the relations between Europe and Tunisia at the moment which, in one way or another, no doubt affects the relations between the institutions of the European Union and the Tunisian authorities within the framework of cooperation and the association agreement?"
"I believe that this is a useful question to ask, because only by understanding as accurately as possible what is happening in Tunisia and the challenges faced by that country, will we be able to find the tone of moderation and effectiveness which we must develop within the framework of cooperation."
"There is a great paradox in Tunisia at the moment and my concern is that this paradox may be becoming increasingly dangerous."
"Tunisia is the most peaceful and prosperous country of the Maghreb, but also has the most closed press and media in the Maghreb."
"It is the country with the greatest growth and with the greatest advances in terms of social modernisation, particularly in terms of education and the status of women; however it is the country in which the emergence of a civil society, which is born of this economic and social growth, does not have adequate means to express itself in complete freedom."
"It is a country which is, and has been, in the forefront of the association agreements and the agro-Mediterranean policy, and which has signed all the international conventions on human rights but where, nevertheless, time and time again problems arise relating to human rights which are exaggerated by sections of the European media."
"Believe me, I am sensitive to the question of human rights."
"I have spent fifteen years of my life without a passport or driving licence."
"I have had experiences, which I will not describe, in the police stations and prisons of the Franco dictatorship, but I believe that the fundamental problem in Tunisia at the moment is a different one: the future of Tunisia."
"We will only be fulfilling our obligations if we in the European Union find the tone and the effectiveness to help the sectors in Tunisia who are in favour of the development needed to accompany and safeguard the future of economic growth and social modernisation."
"I will end by saying that I share to a large extent the points which Commissioner Patten has expressed, but I would also like to hear from the Commissioner that he also feels a deep concern for Euro-Mediterranean policy, for the policy relating to the Maghreb."
"Only by ensuring that we are not in a situation where the Council is giving less priority to the Mediterranean, the Commission is hindering the implementation of programmes and the European Parliament is simply giving lectures, will we be able to find the tone and effectiveness of a policy which will help the future of Tunisia, in friendship and solidarity, towards a situation which brings both socio-economic growth and full democratisation."
"A lot is at stake, not only in Tunisia, but also in the whole of the region, when it comes to achieving the objectives of this task."
"Mr President, the paradoxes of this Parliament never cease to amaze us."
"We do not hesitate to set about installing a political regime in Kosovo which is antidemocratic and made up of only one ethnic group, from which the non-native populations, if I may call them that, will be excluded."
"We do not hesitate to sign trade agreements with China, a totalitarian country if ever there was one, which ordered 1800 executions last year alone - that is the official total - and at the same time, we allow ourselves to pass judgement on the Tunisian government with what is, to my mind, uncalled for severity."
"It is true that not all of the Union' s Member States have, like France, had the privilege to have developed very long-standing links with Tunisia, which enable France to understand that the reality of the situation does not match up to the caricature that some fools in the media have managed to spread throughout Europe."
"It is true that Tunisia does not match up to our idea of democracy, but how many countries in the world and even in Europe, live up to the idea of what democracy is according to a person who is already a democrat?"
"Tunisia is actually the first country in the Maghreb to have signed an agreement with the European Union, and everyone recognises the progress that Tunisia has made in adapting its economy and its social fabric to the modernisation required by its links with the European Union and, unfortunately, by acceleration due to liberalisation through globalisation."
"I would say that the results that Tunisia has achieved make a good case for the country and that is why the trial it is being subjected to seems somewhat disproportionate given the reality of the situation."
"We must, in any event, remember that Tunisia was in the front line of combat when, a few years ago, Muslim fundamentalism threatened the whole of the Maghreb."
"In my opinion, Parliament would be doing something it could be proud of if it took into account the whole geopolitical context of the region instead of behaving like some kind of activist cell. Such behaviour is not even worthy of a non-governmental organisation."
"Mr President, the news reached me here in Strasbourg of a hunger strike involving more than one thousand political prisoners in Tunisia."
"I would like to make two comments."
"Based on Christian beliefs, we denounce this ultimate means of self-defence."
"However, we are quick to add our condemnation of authorities which force their citizens into such extreme despair."
"The present Tunisian regime does not tolerate any independent minds."
"Hence the repression which has lasted for years and is even becoming increasingly harsh."
"This is why I wholeheartedly concur with those who submitted oral questions today, particularly Mr Van den Bos."
"He is quite right in asking the Council for real action because the EU' s own credibility as a partner of the association agreement with Tunisia is in the balance."
"""It is not a case of the population being denied its rights"" , according to a Tunisian defender of civil liberties."
"He goes on to say, ""they might as well forget that these rights even exist."""
"If Tunisians lead this fight, then the European Union should not and cannot trail behind."
"Mr President, I too should also like to express my great concern at the deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia, a concern that is actively shared by all friends of that country."
"For several years now, those who have promoted human rights have suffered, together with their families, continual harassment by the Tunisian authorities and some of them have been given prison terms."
"They are regularly followed by members of the state security services; their passports, and those of their families, are confiscated; their telephone lines are cut off or tapped; they are subjected to defamation campaigns or to verbal and physical threats; and finally, their relatives are regularly interrogated."
"Given this kind of abuse, the European Parliament today reiterates its conviction that there should be no exception to the respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms. This rule cannot be flouted without damage being done, because Tunisia is the first European partner to have concluded, in 1995, as a matter of fact, an association agreement with the European Union."
"This agreement contains a clause which calls for human rights to be respected, with suspensive effect and provides for political dialogue."
"I certainly prefer political dialogue to unilateral sanctions, but, for this very reason, it is our duty to tell our partners that we are extremely concerned about the situation in Tunisia."
"It is our duty to ask the Tunisian authorities to undertake all possible initiatives to establish a genuine multiparty political scene, and to guarantee the freedom of the press and freedom of association."
"But what form will this dialogue take, Mr Patten?"
"What practical and specific steps can we take?"
"How can we make the positions that we adopt here effective?"
"We can start by asking how things are going to develop in Tunisia."
"The Ben Brik affair alone has come to symbolise the exasperation of many Tunisians in the face of the depletion of their freedoms, with the press being only one of the many areas lying in ruins."
"There has been a Ben Brik effect, which goes beyond his individual case and in three months, we have seen a whole civil society, which has demonstrated its determination to end the police state, suddenly gain a new dignity."
"Over these three months, President Ben Ali has continued to wield the carrot and the stick at those who question his methods or who criticise the state of freedoms in his country."
"Given this attitude, we are entitled to wonder if, tomorrow, Tunisia might not become a new hotbed of tension on Europe' s southern border."
"Tunisia' s rulers have two solutions today."
"The first is to continue to refuse to accept the reality of the situation in line with the principle - quite common in this type of regime - of insisting that everything is fine until the final moment, with civil society having to suffer a new wave of repression and to face up to it with courage and determination."
"It would then be the international Community' s task to isolate a power that would be an outlaw and to support the fight of the Tunisian people to regain their sovereignty."
"The Tunisian government can also, however, choose the path of dialogue with civil society, in order to decrease tensions and to negotiate a way of pulling Tunisia out of this impasse and to lead it towards democracy."
"I think that it is important, as Mr Abitbol said, that we choose our words carefully."
"In any event, we must implement every measure that we can to ensure that that is the path they choose to follow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Tunisia must be seen in the wider context of the Mediterranean and the countries of North Africa with which the European Union is interested in maintaining dialogue regarding its peace and stability programmes."
"Out of all those countries, Tunisia has certainly made the greatest progress in terms of its economy, stability and social services, and Tunisia is the country which is most aware of the importance of a Euro-Mediterranean dialogue on economic, political and cultural issues."
"Nevertheless, we clearly cannot disregard the suppression of civil liberties taking place in that country, but I feel that it would not be sufficient or effective for us to adopt a purely condemnatory position, although we must show our disapproval."
"We need an action programme which is capable of genuinely improving the situation step by step, through dialogue and by supporting Tunisian society by means of joint agreements and specific programmes on respect for human rights, as we planned to do with the Cards programme for the Western Balkans"
"In effect, we have to take into account the fact that countries with different traditions from those of Western democratic countries have to mature culturally in their growth towards the full implementation of civil liberties, and that this happens one step at a time, with the result that the whole process takes longer."
"Isolation would not pay off and would be likely to undermine the endeavours of those who are working in Tunisia to improve the quality of its democracy."
"It is therefore to be hoped that the EU-Tunisia Association Council will assume the responsibility of continuously monitoring the human rights situation in Tunisia by means of a joint action carried out together with the equivalent Tunisian representatives, and that it will create a joint system to monitor the issue which can only bring social improvements to the human rights situation in Tunisia."
"Mr President, human rights are being infringed."
"There is no respect for press freedom and the rights to freedom of expression and of organisation, all of which are being ignored."
"This is something we know about."
"It is also known about in Tunisia, both by the authorities and the people."
"Naturally, we shall be taking up these violations and criticising them whenever we have the opportunity to do so."
"This is an extremely serious matter."
"It is a question of universal rights, not only inside but also outside the European Union, and there must be criticism when such rights are infringed."
"I think that the best way of levelling criticism is by means of dialogue."
"This means people' s real respect of one another, and if Tunisia and its leaders are prepared to respect our views on these matters, then I believe that we, in turn, should note that, in Tunisia, they take quite a negative view of the agreements we have in place."
"I cannot find it stated anywhere other than in point 7 of the motion for a resolution of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left that all Tunisian organisations, within both the private and the public sectors, are in fact critical of the association agreement, a state of affairs which we in the EU should, of course, also take on board and respect."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have just come back from Tunisia where, for a time, I was the guest of a Member of the Tunisian Government, and on no occasion did I see evidence of any of the points which have been mentioned during this debate."
"I did, however, see a country which is firmly committed to modernisation and I witnessed the great enthusiasm with which the sectors of environmental development, land reclamation, agriculture, tourism and the construction of large infrastructures are being identified."
"I saw that they are attempting to boost their economy in order to avoid further migration which could certainly affect relations between the Mediterranean countries and the countries which are now part of the same European Union as well."
"I personally witnessed cultural exchanges taking place between universities and saw that the country is regaining a strong cultural identity and is committed to restoring historic town centres, rural tourism and craft trades."
"I noted the high level of involvement of schools in educational programmes with a series of interdisciplinary activities."
"And I saw absolutely no evidence pointing to an absence of associationism."
"On the contrary: very strong, living associationism exists between young people and women, in particular, and there is also a remarkable spirit of partnership between institutions."
"I learned from a question that we are lamenting the fact that the local press refuses to report cases of human rights abuse."
"If this is so and censorship is taking place, it means that the freedom of the press does exist there, to the extent that the local press can even refuse to report any of Tunisia' s positions which do deny human rights."
"Well then, I do not feel that the situation is so bad."
"Rather, I suspect that the European Union is taking political action against not just Tunisia but also the Balkan countries, for example, in deciding to provide greater or lesser financial incentives for the countries depending on the internal policy adjustments which the countries can guarantee."
"This would indeed be an operation totally removed from the real meaning of applied and shared democracy; it would have very little to do with human rights and still less to do with relations between potential enlargement countries and the European Union itself."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, most members here in this House - with the exception of the member who has just spoken - are concerned about developments in friendly, neighbouring Tunisia."
"Tunisia is our neighbour, because the Mediterranean does not divide, it unites us."
"These concerns, as expressed here today, are not born of a colonial or neo-colonial attitude."
"We are not talking about unacceptable interference in the internal affairs of a third country."
"No, we are talking, as Commissioner Patten has stressed again and again, about critical dialogue based on the agreements which we have signed with Tunisia."
"It would therefore make no sense to cancel these agreements."
"On the contrary, we must use them to shape this critical dialogue."
"We are talking about creating a common area of security, stability and peace, and that includes democracy, that includes respect for human rights, that includes freedom of the press."
"When Tunisia keeps insisting that we are also talking about fighting extremism and terrorism and preventing extremist views, attitudes and organisations, then I agree with it wholeheartedly."
"But how else is this fight best fought, if not through democracy?"
"This is also being demonstrated by Tunisia' s neighbours."
"Which is why we cannot do without it."
"Tunisia keeps saying that it is a question of economic and social development."
"But this totally positive economic and social development in Tunisia is precisely the best basis for developing democracy still further and fighting the fight against extremism on democratic soil."
"One last comment: we want to help Tunisia, about that there can be no doubt."
"We must help Tunisia, just as we must help the whole area, the whole region. The Balkans are not our only priority."
"The enlargement of the European Union is not our only priority."
"The Mediterranean is not in the third division, it has equal status and importance."
"When Commissioner Patten states, for example, that we are talking about reforms, about closing the gap between commitments and payments, then that deserves our full support."
"But we must do that all together and sensitively."
"We must do it in a way which does not repulse our Mediterranean partners but which invites them back into the fold."
"Mr President, I have two brief comments to make. Firstly, the Council has taken due note of the legitimate concerns expressed by the Members and we will definitely bear these in mind in our dialogue with Tunisia within the existing institutional frameworks."
"Secondly, to enlighten Mr Ducarme, the General Affairs Council planned for 18 June will basically aim to secure approval, within the Council framework, for the common strategy for the Mediterranean which will then in principle be submitted to the Feira European Council."
"This common strategy has formed part of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme and may constitute an added value in the Barcelona process. It contains some extremely important elements for reorganising and siting the whole external policy of the EU in this area in a more integrated manner."
"At the last General Affairs Council we made an effort to deal with this issue which has some delicate aspects given that these questions are complex and multi-dimensional."
"The extraordinary General Affairs Council, which will be held immediately before the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira, will allow this common strategy to be approved. This strategy will surely form an element which will greatly assist the EU' s overall action, particularly within the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in respect of the whole Mediterranean region."
"Mr President, I shall be even briefer than I was going to be, because the presidency has just answered one of the points put by Mr Ducarme."
"I just want to touch on two other points he raised."
"First, to say that, speaking for the Commission, we very much hope to bring forward proposals in the next few months - or weeks, if we can manage it - for revitalising the Barcelona process, a contribution to the debate about how that can be done five years after the original agreement."
"If the honourable Member needs more information on Tunisia or on the Barcelona process as a whole, I hope he will let me know and I shall try to oblige as rapidly as possible."
"Thank you, Commissioner Patten."
"I have received six motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 40(5)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m."
"China's accession to WTO"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following oral questions:"
"B5-0489/00 by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to the Council, on China' s accession to the WTO;"
"B5-0490/00 by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, to the Commission, on China' s accession to the WTO."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on 17 May I asked an oral question to the Council and the Commission on behalf of the Committee which I chair, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy before the - I would say welcome - signing of an agreement between the European Union and China on the membership of the latter of the World Trade Organisation."
"In this regard, I would like to make a comment and two requests."
"Firstly, on behalf of the Committee which I chair, I would like to warmly congratulate Commissioner Lamy for his patience, perseverance and the skilful contacts he has been holding constantly not only with the Chinese authorities, but also with other important members of the Council of the WTO, in particular the United States, which have allowed both the Congress of the United States and the European Union to reach a preliminary agreement on the membership of China, the importance of which is obvious because it will incorporate into the World Trade Organisation more than a billion people, with all the challenges and possibly positive responses that this will involve."
"Secondly, this agreement is positive because it brings with it economic, social, environmental and also geopolitical advantages for China and the world in general, especially the European Union."
"What seems particularly positive to us is the opening up achieved in the field of financial services, telecommunications and insurance, which will offer opportunities, with no doubt whatsoever, to our economic operators, and also the gradual opening up of the energy markets in China which, apart from certain economic benefits, will lead to greater compliance with environmental standards in that country."
"Another additional advantage is that China, through its entry into the World Trade Organisation, will be subject to its rules."
"This is positive in itself and will bring China into a new and different dynamic in terms of closer relations with the rest of the world, although this must not cause us to stop being vigilant with regard to the respect for human rights, social rights and environmental rights."
"In this respect I would like to say that there will be difficulties, since the position of the Commission and the Council, which Parliament supports, requires fundamental respect for basic social and environmental rights, China' s acceptance of which, paradoxically, will be more difficult to ensure once China is a member of the World Trade Organisation with full rights."
"Therefore, we also fully support the Commission and Council initiative to relaunch the round, which was frustrated at the outset in Seattle, as soon as possible, turning it into a global round."
"Those have been my comments."
"My two questions are as follows:"
"Firstly, we are very interested to know whether the Commission is willing to work closely with the United States on this package of financial assistance, which is so important and necessary, so that China may be provided with the administrative and legal apparatus for it to fulfil its obligations within the World Trade Organisation."
"The other question is as follows: we have worked very well with the Commission and the Council throughout this process and we intend to continue to do so."
"The question is clear. More than a question, it is a request: at the end of the process, will the agreement with China be subject to the approval of Parliament?"
"I believe that this hypothesis does not put the Council or the Commission at any risk, since its success is guaranteed."
"As I have said, Parliament supports this agreement."
"Furthermore, we will all gain in terms of democratic legitimacy with this important agreement, since, I do not need to stress, it is laid down that in important agreements Parliament has a decisive role to play."
"Mr President, the conclusion on 19 May of the bilateral agreement on access to the market in goods and services between the European Union and the People' s Republic of China constituted, as we must all recognise, an important step in the process of China' s accession to the World Trade Organisation which, incidentally, has now been operating for 14 years."
"The integration of a partner with the economic and political size of China into the multilateral trade system will undoubtedly form one of the most important factors in the world economy at the beginning of this new century."
"Mr Westendorp y Cabeza mentioned the size of the Chinese population and market and the importance which this will have in terms of the internal balance of the WTO."
"The universal vocation of the WTO will therefore be reinforced and the discussions on the ways of making its operation more effective will from now on be an absolutely essential exercise."
"At the level of the WTO, the bilateral negotiations now occurring are just one step towards the multilateralisation of the agreed mechanisms and towards the finalisation of the process in Geneva."
"This requires the group' s work towards accession to be continued in terms of the final wording of the respective protocol."
"Only at the end of this process will China' s accession be placed on the agenda of a General Council meeting for approval by the WTO members, assuming that these have, in the meantime, carried out the internal procedures required for this purpose."
"At Community level, this issue must still be discussed by the Member States as the process usually followed and known as the ad hoc Ecuador process is proving to be too tacit and, as such, is incompatible with the political and economic weight of China and with the specific importance of this particular case."
"The European Union will have to give its clear and explicit assent to China' s accession to the WTO and the Council must decide on the overall accession package which must also be submitted to Parliament for an opinion."
"I will not answer the second question posed by Mr Westendorp y Cabeza as this has been overtaken by events."
"It concerned the mandate conferred on the Commission and whether this was broad enough."
"The evidence shows that the mandate was broad enough, even too broad for some countries, including mine, which had certain concerns about establishing this mandate."
"As for cooperation and technical assistance actions, we have seen that, despite the problems noted throughout this negotiating process, China has proven its commitment to the multilateral process and has even prioritised this in certain regional choices."
"It must now, during this stage, make an additional effort to apply the commitments it has made and to demonstrate the necessary willingness to comply with its multilateral obligations and to respect the rules and instructions of the World Trade Organisation. It is therefore of the greatest importance that the Chinese authorities carry out the necessary adaptations internally."
"For this reason the European Union is already prepared to provide nearly EUR 22 million for actions aimed at certain areas which may initially be more difficult to address due to the particular nature of Chinese legislation. These actions include the issues of government acquisitions and intellectual property."
"The developed countries must cooperate closely so that, through technical assistance measures, China can satisfactorily meet the terms agreed for its accession to the WTO. This is a fact which these countries have recognised, as was proven at the summit between the United States of America and the European Union on 31 May when this issue was addressed."
"China' s accession will constitute a stability factor in the world economy and will give increased importance to the next round of WTO negotiations which we hope can start as soon as possible. For this reason we must all make an effort to ensure that this objective is achieved."
"It is hoped that the accession process can be completed quickly through firm commitments which are compatible with the level of development already achieved by certain sectors of the Chinese economy. This will ensure that the stability of the markets will not be threatened."
"However, in addition to this aspect, China' s accession to the WTO will also have effects at political level, given that the requirements for internal reforms and greater transparency, and consequently greater exposure to external public opinion, will have an impact on the actions of the Chinese authorities in areas other than the strictly commercial area."
"However, the next speaker will probably know more about this than I do."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by warmly endorsing a couple of the remarks made by the honourable Member, Mr Westendorp - which, I am sure, is always a sensible way of beginning a speech in a debate in Parliament."
"First, I should like to endorse in the most glowing terms possible the encomium that he delivered to my colleague, Commissioner Lamy, for the way he conducted these negotiations."
"I have had some experience of negotiating with China myself and I have to say that I am lost in admiration for Commissioner Lamy's achievement."
"I should like, as he did with characteristic generosity, to say that all of us should also pay tribute to his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, who helped to get these negotiations up and running, even though they had to travel several more laps than he thought likely at the time."
"Second, I entirely agree with what the honourable Member said about the importance of the outcome of these negotiations."
"This agreement is very good for China and Europe; it is good for the Asian region and for the world and, as we saw, it almost certainly had a beneficial effect on the vote in the US Congress."
"It is good news all round."
"It will be a challenge for China and, in due course, for the WTO."
"However, it has always seemed to me that it is something of a misnomer to talk about a World Trade Organisation which has not contained the representatives of between a fifth and a quarter of humanity."
"This is a good news story."
"I want to deal with the two questions which the chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has raised."
"First, the question about Parliament's assent."
"Commissioner Lamy has already had an opportunity to set out in the plenary of this House in March the view of the Commission that China's WTO accession is a trade agreement of major importance and, therefore, that it is exactly the type of agreement that would be submitted for Parliament's assent, were the Commission proposals for the IGC to be accepted."
"However, at this stage these are just proposals."
"We obviously cannot anticipate the results of the IGC, so we have to stick to current Treaty rules."
"As Parliament knows, the China agreement does not fit any of the categories of Article 300(3) that would justify submission for assent."
"The agreement will, however, in principle, be submitted for consultation, so the European Parliament will have ample opportunity to express its views on the agreement."
"Of course, it is the Council that decides on consultation with the European Parliament."
"This is as far as the legal and the institutional answer goes."
"On a more political and pragmatic level, I can assure the House that the Commission will work with the European Parliament to ensure that it can make its voice heard."
"The House will know that, in exemplary fashion, Commissioner Lamy has held several rounds of discussions with Members of this Parliament during the final phases of the negotiations with China."
"I know that he debriefed Members right after the agreement was initialled: he phoned the honourable Member to inform him that he had finalised the agreement."
"I can assure the House that he intends to continue this dialogue throughout the internal approval procedures of the European Union."
"It is an indication of that old truth that being more transparent invariably means being more successful."
"At this stage I should like to add, however, that on 19 May we only concluded - a point made by the presidency - our bilateral agreement with China on her terms of accession to the WTO."
"The multilateral phase of China's accession that takes place in Geneva has still to be finalised."
"This is not expected to happen before the end of September at the earliest."
"In other words, whatever procedures will apply within the European Union regarding China's WTO accession, the issue is really only relevant after the multilateral phase has been concluded, because the approval procedures will start only after this date."
"Second, I want to come to the extremely important point which the honourable Member raised about technical assistance to help China to implement its WTO obligations."
"We have in the Commission five cooperation programmes in China, which total EUR 25 million."
"They are either in place or will be implemented soon."
"They include a framework programme which aims to strengthen the relevant Chinese administrative structures and capacities through a series of specialised modules targeting segments in the Chinese administration which will be dealing with WTO implementation."
"Other programmes are geared towards helping China to implement specific WTO obligations."
"We are currently considering how best to build on these, and new initiatives will be taken."
"China's WTO accession and the related considerable needs for technical assistance are likely to generate significant interest from other donors, including the United States and Japan, but also from our own Member States and from the WTO secretariat."
"Clearly, close coordination is going to be essential in order to avoid overlaps and to develop synergies between different programmes which each donor will implement in accordance with its own procedures."
"The need for coordination will be especially strong where assistance is targeted at the implementation of specific WTO agreements, and we will support close involvement of the WTO in these areas."
"As regards the question of coordination with the United States, we will certainly look very carefully at our options."
"We have to bear in mind that this will have some effects on the visibility of our European efforts."
"The first exploratory talks on China's technical assistance needs and the respective roles and intentions of various donors will take place shortly through direct contacts in Peking and on the fringe of the WTO working party on the accession of China next week."
"I just want to repeat that this is an extremely important issue; it is an issue on which Commissioner Lamy and I have already begun discussions."
"We want to keep Parliament fully informed about our plans, but I am absolutely certain that, having made this extremely important breakthrough, it is now very important to give as much technical help as possible to ensure that it has the results in China and, therefore, for the rest of the region and the world that all of us hope for and would like to see."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China was yet another of our trading partners to realise during negotiations in Beijing that the European Union has specific, independent weight as a major global trading area."
"The Commission represented coherent positions on the part of the European Union with the support of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers and implemented many of them."
"Competition and the reciprocal opening of markets, freedom of establishment and in the provision of services, intellectual property rights, environmental protection and partnership for sustainable development are just a few examples."
"For the rest, our position is based on the principles of free and fair global trade and is shaped by the European model of a social, ecological market economy, many fundamental points of which are already included in European framework legislation."
"We expressly thank Commissioner Lamy and his team - and I expressly include his predecessor Sir Leon Brittan here - for the excellent result; the Commission negotiated successfully and competently;"
"China has moved a long way towards opening its markets and basically accepts the rules specified by the World Trade Organisation in 1994 and further developed since."
"There is no need to outline the specific successes in detail."
"They range from reductions in customs tariffs, from starting rates of often over 40% to an average of 10%, to the opening of import and export monopolies via joint ventures in the service sector, trade chains and medium-term freedom of establishment for independent European undertakings."
"So the results are clear."
"But integrating China into world trade also means ensuring that it is in a position to respect and apply the rules of the World Trade Organisation, act as a responsible partner and take on new responsibilities."
"We therefore thank Commissioner Patten for his assurance that technical assistance, training for China' s specialists and for those responsible for the new chapter in cooperation will be coordinated with the United States."
"But we feel that something else is needed; greater understanding on China' s part of the European Union' s commercial position on the reciprocal opening of the markets."
"We are counting on China' s supporting the European Union' s proposals for a comprehensive new round of WTO talks in the short term."
"In the long term, we would stress the implications of a more intensive trading partnership with China for peace in Asia, Europe and the world as a whole."
"We feel that China will, in the long term, see the obvious need for the rapid economic and social development of China to be fostered within a framework of open markets and democratic reform."
"On behalf of the PPE Group, therefore, I welcome the successful outcome of negotiations with China and call on the Council to put this result in political order so that the European Parliament is able to adopt this important decision."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, my fellow members have already picked up on the main points."
"Permit me, therefore, to address just a few aspects."
"The European Union has achieved a number of successes, mainly thanks to Commissioner Lamy, who really has achieved some resounding successes."
"But this also applies of course to the United States, and the same will apply to the other countries due to enter into negotiations."
"In my view, one important point will be not just be to help China integrate into the world economy - it has already more or less done that - but also to help this country take a further step towards the general democratisation of its society."
"We have been able to follow what is at stake in all the discussions, in the leading world press and in the lively debate between economists on the matter, but the crucial question is: what will actually happen once China becomes a member of the WTO?"
"Will it mark the beginning of a further opening of society?"
"Will it mark the beginning of a new round in politics?"
"Will it result in institutional reforms in China?"
"And, of course, will there also be a further opening of the market?"
"These are the really crucial and exciting questions which we face."
"I am sure that it is in the minds of all the honourable members who have spoken and I believe that it is my group' s opinion, that we should use this opening and the integration of China into the World Trade Organisation to help it make a quantum leap."
"However, we must not fool ourselves, we must not harbour any illusions, and we must insist that the WTO rules are in fact upheld, because this is, of course, the crux of the matter."
"This is where we really will have to get down to brass tacks during further discussions with the Commission."
"Because the package negotiated is extremely comprehensive and includes highly critical and sensitive sectors."
"Critical voices are already being heard on the part of industry to the effect that success is all well and good, but ex-post control of implementation is equally important."
"I think that we will be able to count on good collaboration here, so that this form of implementation can be monitored by Parliament and Parliament can be kept abreast of current developments."
"One further point which I should like to address, and which I think is highly important, is our hope that with the opening of the market and with the further opening of society in China, greater respect will be given to human rights."
"Human rights are a fundamental element of a modern society."
"I think that this a point which we cannot allow to be sidelined, even in talks, even if they do not form a substantial part of purely economic negotiations."
"I think that you have always set particular store by this."
"Nonetheless, it is important that this point be reiterated constantly."
"Mr President, I have two short minutes in which to make four points."
"Firstly I would like to join in the warm congratulations to Commissioner Lamy and indeed his distinguished predecessor Sir Leon, now Lord, Brittan."
"I hope the brevity of my congratulations does not diminish the warmth of them."
"Secondly, a point addressed to the Council."
"The Council's attitude towards parliamentary assent to a deal like this is linked to the Council's parallel attitude towards the Commission's proposal for its extension of its own powers over areas such as intellectual property and services in Article 133 more generally."
"I have to confess I get the impression that there is a certain degree of institutional territoriality here, particularly in the large Member States, where the trade and industry ministries are very reluctant to see the Commission continue to extend its scope in those new areas in WTO trade negotiations and, consistent with that, also reluctant to see the European Parliament increase its influence."
"This simply cannot carry on."
"It is such a weird anachronism that a policy that was communautarised back in the 1950s is as unaccountable and non-transparent as it is."
"I would plead for the internal territorial interests of Member States to be overcome on this particular point."
"Thirdly, technical assistance."
"It is great that we are going to coordinate with the Americans, but look at the numbers: EUR 25 million is absolutely nothing in comparison to the challenge we face!"
"We have a total budget for China of EUR 80 million."
"Even if we allocate all of that to China-WTO accession it would still not be enough."
"We - the Commission, Council and Parliament - have to be a lot more ambitious in actually allocating much more money towards this enormous task."
"Finally, human rights."
"I hope the fact that we have signed up to this bilateral deal with the Chinese does not leave them thinking that we are going to be any more forgiving on human rights."
"It is all the more important that all three institutions should now be particularly robust about the way the Chinese behave in the so-called dialogue on human rights."
"Let us not give them the impression that a deal on the WTO means that we are going to be weak on human rights - it should be the reverse."
"We should be all the more robust."
"Mr President, if the preceding speakers are to be believed, we now have paradise in view. The Chinese, in particular, are heading there and nowhere else."
"I was reading an interview in China Labour Bulletin the other day about one of the tens of millions of Chinese who have become unemployed because of the famous 'opening up' of their country."
"This person was complaining about the unemployment, insecurity and enormous widening of the gulf between the classes."
"In fact, this Chinese person was so desperate that she said she wished Mao Tse Tung was back."
"From all the analyses I have read, which is quite a lot (both Chinese and Western, liberal and socialist), it is apparent that unemployment is coming to China."
"It has already increased a great deal and, through accession to the WTO, it is going to increase a very great deal more."
"I am wondering now if the Commission has carried out any other analyses."
"I wonder if the Commission has any serious scientific analyses indicating that unemployment in China, contrary to what is apparent from all these other analyses, is going to decline rapidly and that social stability is going to be strengthened instead of the gulf between social classes widening further."
"It would be extremely interesting to know."
"Another matter is that of human rights."
"A number of people here believe that human rights should benefit from China' s accession to the WTO."
"Yes, that is possible - I am no fortune-teller."
"Parliament did, however, give the Sakharov Prize to Wei Jingsheng, who has a quite different view of this issue."
"His assessment is that the WTO Agreement will not benefit human rights at all."
"He has actively fought against it because he thinks that it does not make reasonable demands where human rights are concerned."
"It would be extremely interesting to know what are the Commission' s and the Council' s analyses of this question."
"In what way is Wei Jingsheng mistaken?"
"We should like to know that we are not doing anything which, contrary to our intentions, is unfavourable to human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, it is not pleasant to play the role of someone who repeatedly asks the same questions."
"It is not, however, my fault, Commissioner, if there is a wishy-washy consensus in this Parliament."
"Nor must you count on my weariness to stop me hammering out evidence which, although on the face of it appears dogmatic, should be blatantly obvious to everyone: The WTO is a machine that should by switched off before it goes any further, instead of carrying on as if there were no problem apart from the stunning failure that was Seattle."
"Now, what has happened since that abortive summit?"
"New negotiations have started in Geneva, in a fug that is not dispelled straightaway by Mr Lamy' s praiseworthy speeches to this Parliament, and the European Union, hot on the heels of the United States, is negotiating the future conditions for China' s accession."
"Therefore, we have the right to ask a few questions."
"What purpose do the WTO meetings serve if there is no difference between failure and success in the way internal business is conducted?"
"What credibility can institutional reforms have, given that they are supposed to respond to major investigations, if, even before they are implemented, the path to imminent membership is open to a country which alone comprises one fifth of the world' s population?"
"Furthermore, are you able to tell us how the European Union and its partners categorise China?"
"Do you class it as a developing country or as something else?"
