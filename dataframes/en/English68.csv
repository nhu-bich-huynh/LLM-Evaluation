"The same applies to alcohol: the strategy which I shall be presenting within the coming year will have a special dimension for young women."
"The same also applies to mental health, which will be approached from the criterion of the gender dimension."
"The Green Paper on mental health which we shall be publishing in October will also emphasise this issue."
"We shall soon be announcing the new guidelines for breast cancer screening and we have already extended work on cervical cancer also."
"We believe that, by the end of the year, we shall have the first package of guidelines."
"This proves that we really are taking account of this dimension."
"To close, what is really important, and I take it on board and will promote it in the Commission, is the question of collating data, really accurate data which will give us the real dimension of the difference between the sexes in the health sector; this will of course help both us and the Member States to plan the rest of our strategy."
"For example, in 2006 we shall define indicators for gynaecological health and the menopause, such as an endometriosis indicator which is, of course, extremely important."
"I wish to close by saying that in the pharmaceutical sector, together with my colleague Mr Verheugen, we shall soon be announcing an initiative in the pharmaceutical industry sector and we shall take account here in the patient information sector of the need for a different approach to women as regards the use of drugs which, as the report quite rightly says and there is no need for me to analyse it further, react differently in men and women."
"I shall follow the debate with a great deal of interest."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to thank Mrs Svensson, who has taken the initiative to launch this report."
"I have but one word to say on the matter: ‘vigilance’."
"In fact, the scope and pertinence of the rapporteur’s remarks highlight forms of discrimination that seem to belong to a different era."
"It is unacceptable that, today, the simple fact of being a woman means that there is a greater risk of not being born, and then, of being less well cared for than a man."
"Health is our most precious asset and this asset in currently in danger."
"For a number of years, an increasingly clear link has been established between women’s physical and mental health and their economic situation."
"Poor women have more physical and psychological health problems than other women."
"They have a shorter life expectancy, they experience premature aging and they take more medication."
"One out of every two teenage girls from an underprivileged background shows a high level of psychological distress."
"More than half the number of single-parent mothers live in poverty; they take more medication than other mothers and their level of psychological distress is particularly high."
"Women who are less educated or who are unemployed or poor are, in fact, the most affected by psychological distress and physical health problems."
"Female poverty, single parenthood and social isolation therefore create an explosive cocktail that endangers women’s health, a state of affairs that is quite simply intolerable."
"This report is an extremely useful reminder, which comes at just the right time."
"There are no individual explanations and solutions: we must therefore find joint explanations and solutions."
"That is our political task."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard again today, there is still a lack of any gender-specific health policy in Europe."
"That is why the report by Mrs Svensson is so important, and I am much obliged to her for it."
"It is really no longer acceptable that most medicinal products are still tested only on men – another fact which has already been mentioned – even though we know that biological factors mean that medicinal products work differently on men and women."
"It is also no longer acceptable that, for example, more women than men die of heart attacks, because the differing symptoms that occur in women mean that the condition is not diagnosed in time."
"It is equally incomprehensible, in my opinion, that there is still a complete absence of references to any gender-specific reactions in instruction leaflets for medicines."
"My group fully supports this report, therefore, as it requires Member States to finally take gender-specific health policy seriously."
"Many of the demands put forward in this report are not new."
"This just goes to show how slowly the wheels of bureaucracy turn in the Member States."
"Although EU guidelines for the early detection of breast cancer in women aged between 50 and 69 have been in place since 1992, comprehensive mammography screening exists in only nine Member States."
"This can reduce mortality by 35%."
"This report also calls for screening for women from the age of 40, subject to the availability of evidence-based data, as there are early indications that mortality can be reduced here, too, by up to 20%."
"Another issue we regard as important is that of chlamydia infection."
"This disease leads to female infertility in one third of cases, where it has not been diagnosed in time."
"Further data on this are urgently needed."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to draw attention briefly to a development that is going completely unnoticed by the public."
"Although Caesarean operations present an increased health risk to mother and child, the number of such operations is rising dramatically in several States."
"Causes seem to range from hospital doctors’ duty rosters, to supplementary income from private patients, to parents requesting particular appointment dates: holiday planning plays a major part in this."
"Therefore, my group supports the call – addressed to Member States, in the first instance, of course – for attention to be drawn explicitly to the health risks of Caesareans to mother and child, which are five times greater than with natural births."
"However, we also support the call for the Commission to further study this phenomenon and gather and pass on the relevant data."
"We also welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to take every possible step to ensure that women finally receive a full explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of hormone replacement therapy."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the work of the committee, this report seems very confused."
"It could be described as a patchwork quilt: it lacks any grand design or focus."
"We must, however, have clear areas of focus."
"The speech by the Commissioner just now was very welcome."
"His conclusion that the gender dimension should be taken into account and the areas of focus which he mentioned were truly welcome."
"The main issue that should be raised is the fact that 14 Member States of the Union have not implemented the screening programme to identify cancerous diseases."
"It would save money and human life, and it is very important that these screening examinations are actually carried out in good time."
"It was also very positive that the Commissioner suggested that mental health was a priority."
"In many Member States mental health patients are clearly second-class citizens, and mental health illnesses are not seen as diseases in the same way as others."
"Thirdly, I would also like to say how glad I was that the growth in alcohol consumption was something the Commissioner drew attention to in his speech."
"Alcohol consumption has increased in almost all Member States, and deaths and alcohol-related illnesses have become common."
"This has been a fatal trend, especially among the young."
"There is therefore much to do with regard to this at Union and government level, and priorities must be set."
"Mr President, I too, speaking on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, wish to thank Mrs Svensson for this report and particularly for taking the initiative."
"As has already been emphasised, there were failings: gender differences were not noticed."
"I do hope, however, that the Commission will not merely pay lip service to this, but that this initiative will, in future, lead to more action to rectify this situation."
"There is particular agreement that female genital mutilation is a crime against women in many respects, but especially from a medical point of view."
"The European Union must not be content with making appeals, but must set a crystal-clear example, and I hope that the Commission will join with the next Presidency in launching an appropriate initiative."
"We need screening programmes, we need a notification requirement, and we need penal measures for those conducting genital mutilation in the EU."
"Chlamydia leads to infertility in one third of cases."
"We need greater awareness, more campaigns, to bring this truly dramatic issue into the public eye."
"In addition, the risks arising from hormone treatment, and hyperstimulation in the case of in vitro fertilisation, can no longer be played down."
"The European Union must do more in this field, particularly for the sake of women."
"It is my hope, therefore, that this own-initiative report really signifies a fresh start at European level, and will thus bring the issue of ‘women and health’ into sharper focus."
". Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mrs Svensson warmly for her report, with regard to which I have two points to make."
"The Dutch Parliament will not discuss further measures against female genital mutilation until later on this month."
"The Cabinet has adopted a number of sound recommendations from the Public Health Council on the prevention and prosecution of genital mutilation."
"That itself illustrates how important it is that this subject, and Mrs Svensson’s report, be considered."
"Despite the Netherlands’ image, to which it is attached, of being a progressive country, clear policy on genital mutilation has been too long in coming, and even now, the Dutch Government has not yet decided in favour of a notification requirement for health professionals, because it fears that the public will avoid seeking medical help if is used for enforcement purposes."
"However, we cannot afford to take this casual approach to this serious form of abuse, and we therefore support the appeal in Mrs Svensson’s report for notification to be made mandatory."
"In addition to the gender disparities in health care and the need for a gender-specific approach to health complaints, as indicated in the report, there are many areas left where women and health have a special relationship and where gender-specific effects can therefore be anticipated."
"These should be mapped out before new legislation is introduced."
"Two months ago, the Dutch Parliament decided to have a gender effect report drawn up for the new care system that is due to be introduced on 1 January."
"I would advise the Commission to have similar gender effect reports drawn up in areas of policy that really matter to women, and would ask that these be presented to Parliament before new health care legislation is approved."
"This could, in fact, be seen as an addition to paragraph 11 of Mrs Svensson’s report."
". Mr President, I have no doubt that Mrs Svensson’s intentions in drafting this report were honourable, but programmes appear to have been divided up somewhat artificially on the basis of gender."
"Although the report highlights a number of key problems of both a general and specific nature, its particular focus on certain issues means that it discriminates against others that are no less important, and for no good reason."
"It is always easier to treat a disease whose cause is known."
"After having studied the report, I should therefore like to draw Members’ attention to the fact that discrimination stems from a lack of respect for human rights and ethical principles, as well as from the present epidemic of mental illness."
"It is a symptom of self-centredness, or in other words the desire to dominate others and to subjugate them by manipulating them for one’s own purposes."
"The fact that most medical workers are female, which is a problem raised in the report, does not amount to discrimination."
"Instead, it is a prerequisite for patients, given that women are naturally caring and sensitive to their needs."
"Wages that are too low to meet costs can be discriminatory, however."
"Economic conditions and liberal lifestyles result in discrimination against women who have children and against morally upright families."
"The latter provide the only environment for normal growth and co-existence in an atmosphere of mutual respect and love, and a family environment of this kind requires legal support and pro-family policies."
"At the same time, destruction of the family is one of the causes of sexual promiscuity, which is a further link in the chain of infection of sexually transmitted diseases, in particular chlamydia and HIV, which cause a great deal of suffering, as well as cancer and death."
"Similarly, the fight waged by women for the privileges and rights due to them must not degenerate into aggressive and conflict-generating rivalry with men."
"If the author is genuinely concerned about women who suffer from mental illness and addictions, then why does paragraph 21 contain covert pro-abortion propaganda?"
"Such propaganda disregards traditional standards and results in confusion and depravity, as does the liberal-minded tolerance of deviation."
"Furthermore, although differences do indeed exist between the types of addiction suffered by women and men, the underlying problem is always one of self-addiction."
"The latter is a symptom of individual mental deficiency and of the mental illnesses known in medical parlance as self-destructive behaviours."
"Violence is also a symptom of mental illness."
"Research carried out on people in homosexual relationships has shown that the proportion of men and women using violence is around 50% respectively."
"This proves that violence is not related to gender."
"From a medical point of view, the proposal to administer medicines on a gender-specific basis is entirely misguided, since it is standard practice to adapt dosages to a patient’s body weight or age."
"Any differences in the way individual medicines need to be administered depend on individual sensitivity and sex hormones, which means that there is no justification for the EU’s innovative introduction of gender differences into pharmacotherapy."
". Mr President, I read this report with great interest, since it quite rightly highlights a number of very specific problems relating to women’s health."
"I am delighted that the interest we are taking in such matters may well be born out of the time-honoured European tradition of concern for the weaker members of society."
"This is a fine tradition in this instance, where there is every justification for turning our attention to women as the weaker half of the human race."
"At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves to what extent many of the problems facing women today stem from undesirable changes in civilisation, a flawed family model and negative ideologies that spread in the wake of modern ideas about good and evil and morality and immorality."
"Men are working ever shorter hours, and in some Member States have even secured for themselves a 35-hour week, which means that nothing or almost nothing gets done."
"If we take this fact into account, as well as the fact that women also have to work this 35-hour week as well as looking after a home and family, it becomes clear that a woman’s lot is indeed harder."
"This begs the question of whether arrangements should not be made to allow women to stay at home if they so wish, and to devote themselves to their families instead of working as hard as they frequently do today."
"In my opinion, this report fails to highlight the negative consequences of frequent abortions, although it states very clearly that women are suffering from extremely serious mental disorders."
"It also indicates that levels of alcoholism and drug addiction among women are rising, and, as Mrs Svensson notes, that an increasing number of women are committing suicide, which is highly regrettable."
"The question that needs to be asked is the extent to which this results from flawed family types and models and from such things as the effects of abortions or of certain contraceptives."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in spite of everything we should welcome the fact that women still live longer than men in the majority of countries."
"It is an unfortunate fact, however, that this gap in life expectancy is narrowing, and this is quite obviously a result of the many problems to which Mrs Svensson refers in her report."
"I regret to say that this report has a certain ideological slant."
"As noted by Mrs Krupa, this can be seen in paragraph 21, which refers quite unnecessarily to ‘reproductive health’, or in other words covertly encourages women to have abortions."
"I am mystified as to why ideology-crazed feminists come out of the woodwork during almost every debate we hold."
"During debates on AIDS and on the Millennium Goals, and during the debate this House held on equal rights for women and men, there was always someone who wanted to shoehorn in ‘reproductive health’, or in other words a covert endorsement of abortion."
"This is entirely unnecessary ideology."
"Similarly, the confusion between patients and women in the health service is entirely misplaced ideology."
"Equal access for women and men to health services is one thing, but the internal workings of the health service are something else entirely."
"Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the deluded feminist ideas to which some Members of this House still fall prey."
"It was with the greatest satisfaction and pleasure that I found in point D the statement that public health is affected primarily by ethical and moral principles."
"I hope that public health in Europe reaches an optimal level on the basis of good moral health."
"Mr President, the report in question is remarkably rich and demonstrates a far-reaching ambition in the number of points it addresses."
"However, we know that we have neither the human resources nor the material resources to meet such a large-scale demand, and it seems to me that a certain modesty ought to guide our work."
"It is true that, at a time when we are enabling everyone to benefit from technological discoveries and when we are concerned about the way in which energy and food products are distributed, it is high time that we envisaged the creation of a European bank for health and prevention."
"It is quite obvious that, within the countries that have recently joined the European Union, a large part of the population is excluded from public health systems."
"These people do not go and enquire about health care."
"Should we not, therefore, think about health care coming to them by means of screening campaigns, vaccinations and primary care dispensed, regardless of gender, by mobile teams and equipment?"
"While in our old European countries, in fact, the right to health care has become undeniable, the same cannot be said of these countries, where health and social protection is all too often aimed at those who have paid contributions so as to benefit from this protection."
"It is therefore the case that unqualified and unemployed men and women, elderly people and lone parents do not have access to the most everyday care."
"Leaving aside the resources that might come from the Structural Funds, such as funding allocations for the health care structures already implemented in these countries, it is imperative to ensure that a minimum level of health protection is given to these sections of the community."
"It would be wise, therefore, to begin with the children, as we know that without prevention and basic health care during childhood, incurable problems can set in."
"Then, depending on the needs, it would be a case of treating as a priority those areas with the most significant pathological conditions and, finally, of extending the scope of the activities."
"If we want to aspire to action with a humanitarian dimension, that is our duty as MEPs and that is the duty of our Assembly."
"It is a challenge, admittedly; however, we must have the ambition to accept it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, it is important that we are debating in our Parliament the question of women's health for the first time within the framework of the enlarged European Union, especially in view of future enlargement to countries in which equality between the two sexes has not been established in policies and women's rights need protection."
"I therefore thank our rapporteur for her initiative and the useful information contained in her report."
"Indeed, a prosperous society with standards and cohesion is based above all on the physical and mental health of its members."
"Our report raises awareness of the particular situations which women face in the health sector, such as childbirth, and of particular problems such as breast cancer, cervical cancer, osteoporosis and menopause."
"It gives us information about the particular behaviour which women have as patients and users of certain drugs and therapies."
"The Commissioner has confirmed these peculiarities to us and assures us that he will incorporate them into his new strategy."
"The rapporteur also gives us information about the lack of information and proper approach to these situations by society and by scientific and nursing staff."
"We therefore understand the need – and here I support the rapporteur's proposals – for special studies, detailed statistics and indicators, so that we can study these situations properly and address them effectively with all the parameters and at all levels – prevention, diagnosis and treatment."
"What is important is that we understand that we need to examine the gender dimension in all our national and Community strategies and in all research programmes and all information and awareness-raising strategies, because women themselves must be informed and protected."
"One negative element of the report is that it includes issues which do not come within the scope of the study, such as the call for shorter hours and pay levels and I propose that we should not vote for these paragraphs."
"I should also like the Commissioner, as the question of paragraph 21 was raised, to explain to us what the Commission means by its strategy on sexual and reproductive health."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I thank the rapporteur. Turning to the Commissioner, I think it is appropriate to point out that this ambitious report, which combines a gender approach with health and the state of our health systems, deserves to be placed in the political spotlight, including by the Commission."
"The Commission should make its voice heard and, based on a careful analysis of the various national health systems in the Europe of 25, tell us what its overall approach is, how it intends to include prevention and treatment in all the Union’s policies and, above all, what its assessment is of Europe."
"Once we know that, and after the debate with Parliament, we shall be in a position to say what progress has been made in this continent, which is not merely a series of misfortunes, but a part of the world where women live better lives than in other areas of the planet."
"The Commission should also specify the challenges facing us in building a new welfare state commensurate with women’s needs."
"Europe will not progress without women; that is a political fact that I hope even the Commission will not forget."
"I am therefore grateful for this report, but I must admit that I have asked for a separate vote on three items: recital U and paragraphs 15 and 10, because they are superficial or poorly formulated and, despite the rapporteur’s very good intentions, they are liable to be damaging because they are not comprehensible."
"Recital U and paragraph 15 state that ovarian stimulation as such may endanger a woman’s health."
"That statement is false and may, without saying as much, lead people to condemn stem cell research on the basis of some presumed gender discrimination."
"We do not need obscurantist attitudes!"
"Europe needs to move forwards on a firm scientific footing."
"Paragraph 10, at least as it has been translated into certain languages, calls not for human cloning to be ruled out of European programmes, as would be correct, but for the practice to be stopped or suspended."
"Europe does not finance any programmes of that kind, and therefore the idea that one might say or think that we are trying to stop therapeutic cloning should be ruled out."
"Mr President, there is a great deal in this report, I hope not too much, but I want to thank the rapporteur for including a particular women's health issue with which I have been much involved."
"I refer to a disease which affects an estimated 14 million women and girls across the EU."
"There is no known cure, the cause is unknown and the average diagnosis time is rising, not falling, now standing at nine years."
"The disease I am talking about is endometriosis."
"It wrecks lives, it wrecks families, it causes infertility, it is not just 'bad period pains'."
"The disease desperately needs serious research and attention."
"As Members will be aware, we had a written declaration in this House to raise awareness."
"We achieved a total of 266 signatures, more than has ever been achieved on a single health issue."
"Seemingly, though, the pain caused by this disease goes unnoticed."
"It is a real gender issue."
"Even in our modern society, no one wants to talk about the pain associated with menstruation; women should 'just get on with it'."
"That cannot be right."
"The consequences of this disease are heart-rending for many women and families and there are also consequences for Europe's economy."
"14 million women across the EU are waiting for someone to take their suffering seriously."
"It is wonderful that the rapporteur has included it."
"I was grateful that the Commissioner mentioned it, but really it is now up to the Commission and the Member States to do something about this dreadful disease, which is a gender issue affecting only women and girls."
"I wonder what might have been the case had it been a male disease!"
"Mr President, gender policies must indeed be mainstreamed and incorporated into all political, social and institutional dimensions."
"I believe that the report is a good demonstration of this in relation to medical and health practices and therefore join with previous speakers in congratulating Mrs Svensson, the rapporteur."
"As several studies indicate, men and women are treated unequally in terms of prescription, treatment and medical and health costs."
"To quote examples mentioned in the report, women are victims of specific violence, genital mutilation and of diseases such as osteoporosis, breast cancer and eating disorders. Women also suffer as a result of sexual exploitation, prostitution and a lack of safety at the workplace."
"These are specific issues that call for specific treatment."
"Of the reasons why we take a positive view of this report, I would like to stress its insistence on the need for the States and the Commission to adopt a gender perspective in their policies."
"I was therefore also pleased to hear what the Commissioner said at the beginning."
"Mr President, I concur with the notion that good health is not merely the absence of illness, but is about physical, mental and social wellbeing."
"That concept lies at the heart of a strategy called the Investing for Health Strategy, which I initiated in my constituency during my time as Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the Northern Ireland Assembly."
"I saw myself not as a minister of illness, but as a minister of health."
"This report by Eva-Britt Svensson – and I thank her for it – highlights many of the pertinent issues."
"It contains good, practical recommendations that are worthy of support."
"It has been put to me that being a woman is bad for your health and indeed there are statistics that reinforce that commonly held view."
"We hear now of statistics from Scandinavia suggesting that there are inequalities not only in health status, but also in the response of health systems and health services to women, as compared with men."
"If this is the case in Scandinavia, with its relatively good record on equality, then it is time we took a very close look at trends in other Member States."
"I welcome Commissioner Kyprianou's recognition of the importance of data."
"I also echo the proposal put forward here this evening by my colleague, Kartika Liotard."
"Recognition of gender inequalities in health is required if we are going to successfully combat disparities and ensure that there is adequate health care for everyone."
"Mr President, Mrs Svensson has written an extremely fascinating and complete report, which discusses many aspects that are related to women and health care."
"I am not a doctor, but I gather that many comments in it put the finger on the sore spot."
"I am impressed with the care that emanates from this report."
"It shows a great deal of compassion for the individuals who cannot in any way stand up for themselves, certainly when that is the result of abuse, crime or addiction."
"I wholeheartedly endorse the appeal for an accessible health care system."
"Paragraph 21, however, is in sharp contrast with all the positive sections of this report."
"Whilst the report devotes much attention to the well-being and health of adults, paragraph 21 fails to guarantee this for people at an earlier stage of their lives."
"It appears that the rights of, and care for, adults are more important than those for people who have just started out in life."
"To me, the life of every human being is just as valuable, whether they be very young or very old."
"That is why I would like to call for the removal of those elements that draw a distinction between care in the different life stages."
"In that way, the positive approach of this report can also benefit those people who cannot yet look after their own interests."
"I hope that my fellow Members will be prepared to remove this blot on this otherwise excellent report."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, wish to start by offering my sincere congratulations to Mrs Svensson on her successful report."
"The report that she presented in committee was truly balanced and largely complete."
"It is important that the issue of ‘women and health’ be addressed at European level."
"I should also like thank the Commissioner for instigating the appropriate initiatives in this regard as, firstly, there is still a lack of information on the effects of many medicinal products on women and, secondly, illnesses specific to women are still receiving unequal treatment in research."
"There are hardly any clinical trials involving the testing of medicinal products on women."
"This is a particularly important aspect against the background of our current discussions on the Seventh Framework Research Programme."
"Thirdly – and this is a particular concern of mine – EU action is also important in the case of osteoporosis, the hidden epidemic which particularly affects women."
"It is important that the fight against this disease finally be given a higher profile."
"Quite apart from these comments, I should also like to express my regret that the report in the form currently being put to the vote in plenary is only a watered-down version of what Mrs Svensson originally presented in committee. I find it particularly infuriating that the report now includes demands for shorter working hours and higher pay for healthcare professionals: in paragraph 54, for example."
"Although I fully appreciate the difficult working conditions within the health service, this is not something that should be dealt with at European level."
"Where would we be if decisions on pay were taken at European level?"
"On the subject of working hours: we have only recently adopted the Working Time Directive, so I do not think it right for this issue to be addressed once more in this good report."
"The same goes for an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament on unisex tariffs."
"We adopted a directive regarding unisex tariffs in 2004;"
"I do not consider it appropriate to now demand a further revision of this."
"I, and other members of my group, therefore reserve the right to vote against this report tomorrow – if this means voting on absurd matters – even though I warmly welcome the essence of the report."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even now in the 21st century, women still suffer from all kinds of discrimination: at work, in the home, in politics, in society and in access to healthcare."
"This is not only true of access to sexual and reproductive healthcare; there is also discrimination when it comes to diagnosis and treatment as a whole, particularly as regards what are deemed women’s diseases, such as fibromyalgia, breast and uterine cancer and osteoporosis."
"This is therefore a timely and welcome report and I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Svensson."
"Women are discriminated against because prejudices prevail over common sense and respect for others."
"As a result of prejudice and lack of information there are more women today with AIDS."
"In order to reduce the number of women suffering, and to prevent more deaths, all Member States must, as a matter of priority, ensure access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and family planning."
"We cannot allow thousands of women to go on dying because they opted to undergo backstreet abortions; we cannot allow thousands of young people to suffer the consequences of teenage pregnancy because they have not been given sufficient support; we cannot allow thousands of women to suffer physical and psychological abuse in maternity wards because of neglect and, worse, prejudice."
"Even in European maternity wards there are women who are abandoned for hours on end during labour, suffering terribly, without any help or attention."
"It is known that domestic violence, genital mutilation, the trafficking of women, prostitution and all manner of sexual trade are at the root of serious health problems and deaths among women."
"Violence against women between 15 and 44 kills more women than cancer, malaria, road accidents and war."
"In Europe, however, women continue to be abused, mutilated, trafficked and prostituted, without the authorities in the Member States fulfilling their responsibilities."
"For that matter, what has the Commission done?"
"In this area, it too has done very little."
"Even obvious and simple measures take time to be implemented, such as breast screening, which has only been put in place in a few countries – such as Belgium, Finland, France, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Portugal – and it is crucial that this be extended to cover other countries."
"Health policy falls under the competence of the Member States, but the Commission could and should do more in this area because there are many situations that go beyond national responsibilities."
"– It is always vitally important to bring to the fore the importance of gender mainstreaming in the public health strategies of both the Member States and the Commission."
"We therefore feel that this debate is crucial, and I wish to commend Mrs Svensson on her report, in view of the need to pay greater attention to women’s health, with particular emphasis on pregnant women and babies, and on predominantly female professions."
"Nevertheless, we must become far more proactive in promoting sexual and reproductive healthcare, sexual health and family planning, in guaranteeing women’s right to choose, in creating equal access to health clinics for the purposes of terminating a pregnancy in the first three months for all women regardless of their social and economic situation should they choose to do so, and lastly in putting an end to the mutilation of women, backstreet abortions and the criminalisation of women, which still goes on in some EU countries, including my country, Portugal."
"The European institutions and the Member States should play a more active role in protecting women’s health and should take the opportunity of the forthcoming United Nations World Assembly to do so."
"– Mr President, the word 'health' is feminine in most languages and the pagan Europeans of ancient times envisaged health as a beautiful woman, statues of whom we admire to this day."
"The Svensson report comes at the beginning of the 21st century to prove that often, due to technological achievements and despite the progress of science and perhaps due to the breakdown in values, a large proportion of women in the European Union have or risk having bad health or are threatened by a plethora of illnesses, disorders and addictions."
"However, the subject of today's report is gender discrimination in health systems; in other words, in the ways and means of addressing all the terrible and frightening threats described to women's physical and mental health."
"Congratulations to Mrs Svensson who, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, has sounded the alarm; congratulations to you Commissioner on your findings and the solutions which you have proposed, in order to generate attention to, and an initiative for, the health of 42% of the working population in the Union, as well as for elderly women who have already made their contribution in two workplaces: at work and in the home."
"Initiatives also on the health of girls and young women in the European Union, because its continuing life and prosperity depend on them."
"Even if in the motion for a resolution there is a lack of hierarchy and certain indications border on exaggeration and touch on the principle of subsidiarity, I feel, as a female Member of the European Parliament and as a women with daughters of her own that approaching health problems and the causes of illnesses with gender sensitivity is a civilised step."
"This is a difficult subject, as the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, whose contribution we must also call upon, also acknowledges on its website."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in spite of the fact that I belong to what certain people – if only a few – call ‘the weaker sex’ and that I am many hundreds of miles from my children this evening, I want very much to be here debating this important issue."
"I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, my Swedish fellow Member Mrs Svensson, for having included many important issues worth highlighting in this context."
"I am very glad that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has supported my amendments concerning, for example, women and smoking. The latter now forms part of paragraph 34, and I naturally hope that I shall receive support for it tomorrow."
"Sweden became the first country in the world in which the number of women smokers exceeded the number of male smokers, a fact of which I do not feel especially proud."
"Women are more vulnerable than men to the dangers of smoking."
"One explanation is that, in general, women are smaller than men and have smaller hearts and narrower coronary arteries than men."
"Investigations also show that it is mainly poorly educated women in low-paid jobs, for example care assistants and other health care workers, who are the biggest smokers."
"In the last few days, a major new study carried out by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) was presented, showing for example that women with symptoms of heart disease and vascular disorders generally receive worse care than men, and this in spite of the fact that women’s chances of surviving heart attacks are fewer than men’s."
"Discrimination of all kinds, in this case gender discrimination in health systems, is an international matter."
"We in the EU should therefore come up with a clear policy and also draw on each other’s experiences."
"In the system of values of the consumer society, health has become a fundamental determinant of quality of life, and it has evolved into a major factor in economic and social policy."
"Direct and indirect expenditures on medical treatment account for an ever-increasing share of the budgets of the Member States of the European Union."
"However, the positive effects of this are not experienced by everyone to the same degree."
"In the case of poor and disadvantaged groups, excluded on several counts, who make up the bottom third of society, we cannot say that there has been any significant change for the better either in terms of quality of health care provision, or in terms of their well-being, state of health, or life expectancy."
"The report drawn up by my fellow Member, Mrs Svensson, clearly articulates the need for greater equity in health care provision."
"The objective is to provide the same quality of health care and ensure equal access to health services for women and men."
"A particularly strong point of this report is that it calls for the creation of the conditions for equal access to health care and equality of opportunities for pregnant women, women living with chronic illness or disability, older women and those belonging to other disadvantaged groups, for example Roma women."
"Due to a lack of statistical data, we have no figures on the relationships between the Roma population as a whole or Roma women in particular and the various types of institutions that make up the health services."
"Few surveys have investigated the degree of prejudice manifested by health service employees in the way they deal with Roma people. Neither do we know what prejudices or fears are harboured by Roma people with regard to the health service and its employees."
"From reports by human rights NGOs and anthropological descriptions, however, the clear picture that emerges is that Roma women living within the European Union get poorer-quality health care, as they are affected by a number of unfavourable factors and are subject to discrimination."
"In Hungary today, for example, the life expectancy of a Roma woman is 62.5 years, while that of non-Roma women is 75 years."
"We need to have a great deal more discussion on the decisive factors involved in curtailing the lives of fellow women who are Roma by 13 years."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to refer specifically to two diseases mentioned in the report: chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia."
"These are two invisible diseases, given the difficulty of their diagnosis and the lack of resources devoted to research and their treatment."
"It is calculated that 90% of the people suffering from these diseases are women."
"We are therefore clearly dealing with two gender diseases."
"Consequently, research into the origin and causes of these diseases is urgently needed, in order to improve treatments and compare results."
"To this end, it is essential to increase the resources allocated to research, improving the training of health professionals, organising information and social awareness campaigns, carrying out studies on their social, legal, economic and healthcare repercussions, and also to promoting and developing new techniques for early diagnosis and for the dissemination of existing prevention methods."
"For all of these reasons, I would like to call upon the Commission to carry out a study that compares the degree of application of treatments and their effects, both physical and psychological, in each of the Member States, in order to make progress with tackling these diseases."
"It is essential to take account of the gender perspective when drawing up and applying health policies."
"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome are not the only diseases that mostly affect women."
"Other gender diseases that have been mentioned more often in this debate, such as breast cancer and osteoporosis, are at a rather more advanced stage in terms of prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Nonetheless, in all cases it is necessary to continue actively to make progress, to continue research and to ensure that the public authorities work to effectively guarantee the health of men and women."
"The European Parliament frequently draws attention to human rights."
"As members of parliament we draw attention to events around the world and we are particularly sensitive to minorities, who, in certain cases, demand special attention and care."
"We women are not a minority, however."
"We represent more than half of the population of the European Union."
"In spite of this, women in our society encounter problems that are solely a result of their gender."
"So the fact that the treatment of women in various health systems continues to be discriminatory is something we simply cannot accept."
"Yet the right to healthcare is one of the basic socio-economic rights in the European Union Charter of Human Rights."
"Therefore it is right and proper that the European Parliament, as the highest democratic institution in the European Union, should draw attention to this fact and put forward possible measures."
"In doing so we must observe the principle of subsidiarity and we must also do so in the document we are discussing today."
"I therefore support the document and I also support the amendments, which are needed if the principle of subsidiarity is to be taken into account."
"In other words we, as the European Parliament, cannot interfere in the jurisdiction of individual Member States."
"However, we do have the opportunity to take an important step in discussing and formulating European policies, where we do have the relevant jurisdiction."
"May I point to the example of the joint decision-making of the European Parliament on the seventh framework programme."
"Health is an important part of this programme."
"The financial resources we earmark for this programme must reflect demographic indicators and the genuine needs of our citizens."
"In this way we can also come closer to the people and give them the opportunity to see directly how joint European policy can affect their quality of life."
"Mr President, I shall take a few seconds to complain once again about these debates always being held at night."
"We have often met to talk about women in the middle of the night, and with you in the chair I believe."
"We always talk about women in the middle of the night, and one day we could do so in daylight, Mr President."
"The inequality and discrimination suffered by women is structural and sustained."
"We women have always been carers rather than cared-for."
"There is therefore still a very significant imbalance between the level and quality of care for men and care for women."
"We do, however, have certain common values in Europe, such as fairness, universality and solidarity. Accordingly, we must also apply the gender perspective in the area of health, as the Commissioner has quite rightly said today."
"I welcomed the initiative taken by the Social Democratic Ministers of the European Union who met in Sweden at the end of August, discussed the reduction of gender inequalities in health care and expressed their concern about the situation."
"There are certain issues the report should have dealt with in more depth, and which relate in particular to sexual and reproductive health, as many speakers have already said."
"It has also already been pointed out that violence is a health problem. There is another important issue worthy of mention: the difficulties faced by immigrant women in accessing health systems, because they are afraid."
"I hope we will meet again in daylight."
"I hope that this report will help to foster a uniform attitude throughout the European Union with regard to protecting women’s health."
"I would like to draw attention to an important issue: we must not allow women to face discrimination in the health services again just because they are poor, on a low income or because they are suffering from specifically women’s illnesses."
"In the health services we must not repeat the mistakes that put women at a disadvantage in other areas of life."
"On the other hand, it would also be very important to ensure that, as part of their training, medical and health care personnel acquire the knowledge and skills enabling them to deal appropriately with illnesses that are specific to women."
". Mr President, first I should like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for the very interesting debate."
"I have also followed closely the proposals and views expressed."
"Of course, I cannot comment on all of them in such a short time, but I have taken note of them and I shall of course take very serious account of them."
"The fact is that there is a difference when it comes to health between men and women; there is the question of the illnesses which affect both sexes but which are peculiar either in their diagnosis or treatment in women and, of course, there are illnesses which affect women in particular."
"This is something which needs to be taken into account when policies in the health sector are defined."
"Of course, I shall not refer to all the specific illnesses mentioned."
"What I can say, however, is that our new programme makes special provision and gives us the facility to turn our attention to specific illnesses."
"Of course, they cannot all be covered, but we shall be able to define the priorities together when the time comes to adopt the programme."
"This of course brings me to a basic point which I would like to raise: the need for money, because everything that has been said is all very well and good."
"It is indeed everything we could wish for but, without the necessary financial resources, it cannot be achieved."
"This means, first of all, that the Member States will need to earmark part of their budget for this sector and I agree with the report, which encourages the use of the Structural Funds for investment in the health sector; it is a very good proposal and I urge all the Member States, especially the new Member States, to make use of this facility."
"However, we too at Community level need the financing we have requested if we are to be able to implement the programmes we propose."
"I am aware of Parliament's positive stand in this sector and I am depending on its support with the problems which exist as regards the adoption of the financial perspectives for the next budget."
"I should also like to say that we need to understand that many issues fall within the competence of the Member States: the provision of medical services, the health systems, all this is the responsibility of the Member States."
"As I have already said, we shall make use of all the non-legislative means we have at our disposal to promote policy in these sectors."
"However, the reference made earlier, for example, to the question of breast cancer screening – that it has not yet been implemented in all the Member States – highlights precisely one weakness."
"I believe that collecting and publishing data and information for the Member States in these sectors will create significant pressure on them to implement precisely these recommendations and the guidelines which they agree with."
"To close, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament once again on this initiative."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mrs Honeyball, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on options for developing the European schools system (2004/2237 (INI)) (A6-0200/2005)."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the House for giving me the opportunity to present this report."
"It is an important report in terms of the schools which the European institutions run principally for the children of staff who work in the institutions."
"It is quite an undertaking these days."
"At the moment there are over 19 200 pupils in fourteen European schools in ten locations, including Brussels and Luxembourg."
"Therefore, we have a responsibility here to make sure that these schools are providing the best education possible, in the best way, making best use of the resources and using the teaching staff and the curriculum in the best possible way."
"That is what I have sought to look at in my report, and it is important that we consider these issues at this point because these schools were in fact set up about fifty years ago and, although there have been times when they have been looked at, essentially not very much has changed in that time."
"So we now have an opportunity to look at these schools, the way they are run, their governance, their funding and the curriculum, and make recommendations for improvements."
"In my report, I have specifically looked at those areas, that is to say, at finance, governance and government of the schools, at the curriculum and the way that it is taught within the schools."
"First of all I would like to raise the question of finance."
"Mr Bösch is here who in fact did a report a couple of years ago on this subject and I think he will want to talk further on this."
"However, it is important that we look at the way the schools are funded and make sure that we are using our funds to the very best advantage."
"A particular area I would like to highlight is the way that teachers are employed."
"At the moment, teachers are seconded from Member States to teach in the European schools for a certain period of time after which many of them go back to their own Member States."
"Given the way the schools are organised, in that in addition to mother-tongue teaching, there is teaching of certain subjects in Community languages, the system as it stands at the moment places an unfair burden on English-speaking countries, which provide proportionately more teachers because there is a demand within the European schools for English teaching."
"I hope, as a result of this report, that particular issue will be taken on board."
"The other thing which is important under the ‘Finance’ heading is the question of fees and the way that the structure of payments works."
"Children of employees of the European institutions do not have a fee levied on them, which is absolutely right because that is the reason why the schools were set up."
"However, these days, many school places, not the majority, but very many places in the schools, are filled by children from outside the European institutions."
"There are a significant number who come from other government-type institutions and from local industry."
"They are generally paid for by the organisation which sends them. So that does not present too many problems."
"But where there are real difficulties is in the remaining pupils, who are chosen by what appears to be a fairly random method and pay a proportion of the fees themselves – their families pay for them."
"This system has come in for considerable criticism because it is not transparent and very often the fees levied are not sufficient, they are not actually reflecting the market rates."
"Turning to the question of governance, I would like to see the administrative boards which govern the schools have more autonomy."
"In terms of curriculum, the main thing is that we reduce class sizes so that no class within the European schools is more than thirty; at the moment the maximum is thirty-two."
"So I commend this report to you and I ask for your support."
". Mr President, Mrs Honeyball, your report considers some very sensitive matters and I have already encountered the difficulty which you mentioned in your introductory remarks."
"It is a very controversial issue and sometimes I ask myself why I am here on this side and not on your side asking the questions, because the European schools are quite autonomous bodies with autonomous structures, which decide a lot of these questions by themselves."
"The Commission is fully committed to the cultural specificity of the European schools."
"It therefore endorses most of the points made in this report, since the sound functioning of the European school system is our common objective."
"As regards the budgetary features, we would like to ensure accountability for all actors through transparency, planning and control and therefore sound and efficient use of our citizens' money."
"I understand people's frustration sometimes when everything comes down to money, but we must understand that in many cases the devil lies in the detail of these financial matters and they must be handled properly."
"On governance aspects, I am very pleased to note that the report calls for greater representation for the EU institutions on the Board of Governors, more in line with the role they play and with the EU's financial contribution, currently at EUR 127 million, that is, roughly 60% of the overall budget."
"Experience has shown that the 1994 Convention is no longer equipped to meet the challenges relating to enlargement and its consequences."
"I trust therefore that I can rely on your support for improving the current governance mechanism."
"I am also pleased to see that we share the same concerns as regards children with special educational needs, in line with the measures advocated by the rapporteur on this subject."
"Only by progressing in this manner and by making appropriate resources available will we be able to ensure a truly human and inclusive approach."
"As far as a European baccalaureate is concerned, I agree with the view that all Member States should be called on to ensure that it becomes more widely available."
"When designing the appropriate processes, however, we must be careful to ensure that the same quality standards are met."
"I agree that efforts should be pursued to allow European schools to offer, as an alternative, a leaving certificate for pupils who choose to follow a more vocational education."
"Nevertheless, I would like to stress the Commission's concerns in a number of areas."
"With regard to the financial aspects, we should find ways to seriously and concretely improve the management and reporting."
"I still believe that the idea of establishing a yearly ceiling on the Community contribution to the European schools should be carefully considered, as some Members have stressed."
"I also believe that it is important to apply and to revise the so-called criteria, which have been adopted after careful discussion by the Board of Governors, the decision-making body of the European school system."
"If we are to ensure the maintenance of the European school system as defined in its founding convention, we must have the courage to address the question of the future of those European schools that no longer fulfil the objectives for which they were initially created, without excluding any option."
"I do understand the various expectations following enlargement, but the answer cannot be a systematic creation of new schools for which no justification exists."
"That would be in complete contradiction with the mission and the spirit of the European school system."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur on this report and my thanks for including some key elements from the Committee on Budgets in compromise amendments."
"As the rapporteur and also the Commissioner have already said, we are now at a stage at which such reports are extremely important."
"On the one hand, there is enlargement, which the European School system is clearly not yet tackling successfully."
"There has been a barrage of complaints from parents about the extent of the failure of this school system to cope with the enlargement by ten new Member States despite this being a foreseeable development."
"I would say to the Commissioner that this is a sphere in which we, and also the Commission, as the Union’s executive body, must take action."
"The Commission will have Parliament’s backing."
"A second point is that, of course, it is very important to this House that those who pay have a little more say on the Board of Governors than 1 vote out of 26."
"This emerges clearly from the report."
"Here, too, we are of the same opinion."
"After all, we are paying 57% of the budget; the Member States 22%, and this is completely disproportionate to our right to have a say."
"A further challenge is that the Heads of State or Government never tire of inventing new agencies."
"The Commission is not entirely innocent of this."
"We should of course add in parenthesis at this point that every agency can potentially bring a school in its wake."
"For this reason, too, it is important to ask the right questions and seek answers."
"Finally, on the subject of the smaller schools, we shall have to proceed differently according to regional viewpoints, which is why we have attached great importance to preparing a certain amount of budgetary decentralisation."
"The Member States will have to be held more financially responsible."
". Mr President, Commissioner, I would like first of all to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, for her report and her frank collaboration."
"The European schools system has proved its worth."
"Having paid particular attention to the Luxembourg school, I would like to congratulate the teachers and the management who have succeeded in bringing together, under the same system, children and teachers from the various Member States of the European Union."
"Multilingualism has also been able to prove its worth, just as one school system for the various EU nationalities has done, in spite of temporary overcrowding in the schools in Luxembourg and Brussels."
"Should we not, Commissioner, evaluate in the medium term the European schools system and expand the multilingual education model, encouraging the Member States to become more involved in it by drawing on the experience of the European schools?"
"Furthermore, I believe that any country that puts itself forward to house an agency should be required to commit itself to ensuring that the children of the officials it is accommodating receive a multilingual education."
"Ghettoisation of the schools by only admitting pupils whose parents are sufficiently wealthy to pay the fees already required in Category III should therefore be prevented."
"For the 2004 academic year, 32% of the overall pupil intake – that is to say a third of the children – belonged to that category, for which the fees are very high."
"That is why I have tabled an amendment to reduce Category III fees for future pupils too."
"Our committee is calling for class sizes to be reduced, special needs pupils to be admitted and a technical baccalaureate to be introduced."
"While the aim of the European schools system is to provide an education for the children of officials that does not neglect their mother tongue, this aim does, nonetheless, deserve a rethink in light of the mobility already achieved within the European Union and of what it will be in future."
"Mr President, although a British minister declared in 1998 that English would shortly be the universal language – the price paid by English teachers will perhaps be that of being in demand – I am of the opinion that multilingualism is part of European identity."
". Mr President, the European schools are important to the identity-building process and also to the making of a true European citizenship."
"Europe – the EU – is an ongoing building process and its construction has been undertaken in a complex manner."
"Education plays a very important and fundamental role."
"Different EU education systems are entitled to spread the ideals and values that Europe has traditionally inspired."
"From this, it will help to set up a sense of common European citizenship."
"The defence of pluralism and diversity has always been one of the core values that have influenced the European Union."
"This is one of the myriad of reasons why a stateless nation's citizens continually advocate the whole idea of Europe; we regard Europe as our national environment."
"EU enlargement has provided all of us with a new challenge for European schools."
"This has to do with a new European Union facing its work."
"Such a moment will entail greater plurality and a healthy breath of fresh air for European schools."
"In a truly pluralist Europe, I consider that real multilingualism cannot be just partially expressed and the real linguistic plurality of our continent has to be uncovered."
". Mr President, whilst I do not believe that the United Kingdom should be part of the EU, it would be quite wrong of me to deny the right of those parents who work for the qualifying institutions – in most cases outside their country of origin and in many cases in a country that does not share their mother tongue – to give their children a suitable education."
"The European schools provide the only practical way for many such parents to exercise that right."
"I have no quibbles there."
"In most respects, the rapporteur has considered the European schools in the same proper light."
"It would be churlish of me not to say so."
"I do, however, differ from her on one or two points."
"First of all, the rapporteur defines Category I pupils as children of staff in the service of Community institutions and bodies."
"There is a significant omission here."
"Category I status also covers children of the staff of the UK Atomic Energy Authority seconded to the joint European tourist projects in Culham, near Oxford, and children of staff covered by the service regulations of the European Patent Office in Munich."
"The UK Atomic Energy Authority is most certainly not a Community institution and, furthermore, the joint European tourism project involves one EU pre-accession state, Romania, and one completely non-EU state, Switzerland."
"As for the European Patent Office, it covers Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and will soon bring in Norway. As I had to stress during the debate on computer patents, that means that it is most assuredly not a Community institution."
"I am sad to have to make that point again so soon."
"Too often we see an assumption in this Parliament that Europe and the EU are one and the same thing."
"Here is another example. This is not a trivial point in a general sense, nor is it trivial with specific regard to this report, because the rapporteur states that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are Category I. She may well be correct, but if she actually means that only 1.6% of pupils at Culham are children of staff in the Community institutions then she could be very wide of the mark."
"I hope she can clarify that statistic."
"I am most concerned by the Commissioner's suggestion that the option of offering the European baccalaureate outside the current school system should be considered."
"Could the rapporteur please clarify that as well?"
"Is the Commission suggesting that the European baccalaureate should be available in schools other than the European schools?"
"I simply do not see why it is necessary to interfere with other schools in order to broaden and modernise the curriculum of the European schools."
"If I were a teacher and a pupil gave the EU as the answer, I would have to conclude that it was a very stupid question."
"– Mr President, listening to this debate, one is tempted to ask a couple of basic questions."
"EUR 127 million of taxpayers’ money – for whom?"
"Why?"
"Is it not the case that Europe is now so evolved that many officials stay in one place for a very long time, not to say their entire career?"
"Is this form of assistance not tantamount to a further subsidy for this handful of privileged individuals in Luxembourg, Brussels and elsewhere?"
"Is it not also true that, in reality, as a cost-accounting matter, these additional costs should be factored in from the outset when locating and relocating agencies?"
"Yet this is not being done; the procedure is still marked by a lack of transparency."
"There is a reason why these reports have been appearing at two-year intervals, and it is that these schools are not doing particularly well."
"At the end of the day, the fundamental question arises as to whether this system, which actually did have some justification 20, 30, or 40 years ago, is sustainable as such."
"Every enterprise sending staff abroad knows that there is a variety of other schools on offer – German schools, English schools, UN schools – so why are we allowing ourselves this luxury?"
"Is it really necessary?"
"I have heard a lot of good things about the European schools from parents."
"However, as a result of more complex organisation and the large number of pupils, certain deficiencies have begun to appear, and particularly since the accession of the new Member States last year, when the number of pupils increased significantly."
"Some schools have been over-subscribed and this has impacted on the quality of the teaching."
"Increased demand also requires more funds to be earmarked."
"The first year at school is particularly stressful, both for parents and for pupils, as from day one they have to cope with adapting to a new environment, a new language, new classmates and new teachers, so the understanding of teachers during this period of integration is essential."
"The greatest difficulties are experienced by those pupils who have to follow most subjects in a foreign language."
"Pupils who know a foreign language at a conversational level also have problems in specific subjects like chemistry, geography, maths and so on. The children attending these schools have varying talents and some are more hard-working than others, and not all of them can meet the demands of the programme leading to the European school leaving examination (baccalaureate)."
"It is therefore necessary for pupils to have the possibility of receiving a different school leaving certificate and not only the certificate that they have passed the school leaving examination."
"Likewise there is insufficient provision for children with special needs, who require a greater degree of accommodation and specially trained teachers."
"In overcrowded classes teachers cannot devote sufficient attention to children with special needs or those with learning and social difficulties."
"In any event we should praise the efforts of all those who are striving to ensure high-quality teaching and assistance in the integration of and familiarisation with multicultural Europe."
"We should try to ensure that as many children as possible can use their mother tongue for at least some of the time in the European schools, or when they finish school they will have a great deal of knowledge but will not be able to use their own mother tongue correctly."
"Mr President, in the few seconds that are available to me I would like to raise the question of children with special educational needs."
"I was quite surprised to hear the Commissioner here this evening offering his defence and support for those children when the Commission has in fact defended discrimination against families with children with special educational needs."
"The Ombudsman has found it necessary to present a special report to this House in the light of a complaint made to the Commission by a family who had been discriminated against, and the Commission defended that discrimination, despite the fact that it is contrary to the European Treaties."
"The Ombudsman found that the discrimination was such that it constituted an unjustified discrimination."
"It is sad to say that this is not the only such case: a number of other cases have also been the subject of complaint to the Commission, and have also been defended by the Commission."
"I support the Honeyball report and urge this House to support, in particular, paragraphs 24, 25, 26 and 27, which deal with this question of special educational needs and the need for the Commission to ensure that sufficient resources are available to ensure that no child is turned away from the European school system because of their disability."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that my experience as headteacher of a grammar school in a large provincial Czech town, where pupil numbers are comparable to those of the European school in the Spanish town of Alicante, makes me well placed to comment on the issues that most affect the European schools."
"The Commission communication makes it clear that constraints are placed on the long-term financial planning of individual European schools in the shape of staff management and school development strategies."
"It is impossible to manage any company well in the face of such uncertainty, let alone an educational institution."
"I therefore very much welcome the proposal to transfer such decisions to headteachers and boards of governors, as they are the ones who best know the current needs and requirements of their institutions."
"If I may, I should now like to touch on a number of areas where improvements would lead to an increase in the standard of education."
"Many fellow Members of this House, as well as teachers, experts and parents in the majority of Member States, would be up in arms if the maximum number of pupils per class were 32."
"In most places such class sizes have been consigned to the dim and distant past, but in certain European schools they are part of everyday life."
"Classes are not usually so large, of course, but such cases have been known."
"It is self-evident that a smaller number of pupils makes it possible to apply different pedagogical methods and procedures in the classroom."
"We must not neglect the requirements of pupils with special educational needs and those who receive most of their education in a language other than their mother tongue."
"If the EU institutions wish to make good on the commitment they made 50 years ago, namely to offer the children of their employees a high-quality education, then they should give due consideration to these obvious requirements."
"In conclusion, I should like to lend my support to calls for the introduction of an alternative leaving certificate, in addition to the highly academic European Baccalaureate, for pupils who decide to study vocational subjects."
"At the same time, it would be appropriate to earmark a certain percentage of resources for the civic and practical skills needed to prepare all children for their future."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, first I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Honeyball, on her excellent work."
"However, the objectives of European schools cannot be better expressed than through the words of Jean Monnet, who said that children of Europe educated side by side from an early age familiarise themselves with all the different cultures."
"They learn to live without prejudice and thus there is born and matures within them the idea that they belong together."
"Looking incessantly at their earth with love and pride, they will become Europeans in spirit and through education they will be ready to complete and consolidate the work of their fathers and to put flesh and bones on a unified and flourishing Europe."
"European schools, therefore, are an institution which promote the ideas on which the European Union was built."
"They are an institution which respects and promotes multilingualism, while pupils learn from pre-school age to live and act within a multicultural framework."
"The 14 schools which exist today provide a common education of a high standard which will prove in future to be fundamental to European integration."
"The European baccalaureate awarded to pupils is their passport to university and certifies the European profile of future workers."
"It is therefore important for more European schools to be founded, probably in the new Member States also; this will bring us a step closer to European integration."
"Finally, in order to safeguard and maintain the standard of education, a solution needs to be found for oversubscribed schools, especially the schools in Brussels."
"The European schools are an institution which need to be safeguarded and developed in proportion to the demands of the times, because education is the most important means of shaping perceptions and because, to paraphrase Monnet, when children become European in spirit, they will find it easier to love their earth and to forge a more substantial path towards European union."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to address a number of questions to the Commission concerning the four smaller European Schools."
"Firstly, does the Commission agree that the sharp increase in the number of Category I and Category II pupils in the Karlsruhe European School differentiates it clearly from the other three smaller schools?"
"Secondly, is the Commission aware that, currently, more than 60 companies throughout the Karlsruhe region have Category II agreements in place?"
"Thirdly, can the Commission confirm that its own financial contribution to the Karlsruhe European School has been halved over the past five years thanks to these Category II agreements?"
"Fourthly, does the Commission agree that this school’s pupils now include not only Category I children of employees of the Institute for Transuranium Elements, but also some 50 children whose parents work at institutions here in Strasbourg, and who take the daily shuttle bus?"
"Fifthly, does the Commission agree that the city of Karlsruhe only recently invested large sums of its own money in an exemplary school renovation and extension project?"
"Sixthly, why, in its answer to my written question dated 15 June of this year, was the Commission unable to tell me the number of pupils with Category I entitlement within a 100 km radius of the school?"
"Is it still possible for the Commission to ascertain and publish these figures?"
"Seventh: particularly as the rapporteur mentions at the beginning that Category III pupils are not paying sufficient school fees to cover all the costs, how does the Commission justify the privilege – incomprehensible to the public – of its own staff and other parents of Category I pupils, which is that they do not have to pay any school fees at all?"
"I am very much obliged to Commissioner Kallas for his attention and for his readiness to provide a written answer to these questions. I would invite him most cordially to join me and see for himself the significance of this site in Karlsruhe at either end of one of the forthcoming plenary sessions."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, are the European Schools the flagship of the European education system?"
"No, they are not."
"Where do they rank according to the PISA study?"
"Are they meeting quality targets?"
"The answer is ‘no’."
"Are their shortcomings purely due to budgetary factors?"
"Again, the answer is ‘no’."
"The list of shortcomings grows longer; complaints by parents and pupils grow louder."
"Action is needed, as indeed the present report makes plain for all to see."
"I should like to use my speaking time to give a voice to the letters of complaint I have received from parents and pupils."
"They complain of overcrowding in the European Schools."
"In Brussels, there has been an intake of 8 600 pupils this year, although the intended number was just 7 300."
"The classes are too large."
"High-achieving pupils are rarely being stretched or encouraged."
"In the second school year following the major enlargement, the languages of the new Member States are still not on the curriculum."
"The availability of languages rapidly decreases if pupils put the main emphasis on scientific subjects."
"Furthermore, the role of the ‘educational advisers’, as they are known, remains unclear."
"The European Schools lack an appropriate administrative culture."
"Letters are going unanswered."
"The European Schools and their heads need more efficient disciplinary control."
"There are often failures in control at Member State level, and there is insufficient provision for control at European level."
"In May, the Commission received a petition from parents of pupils in the German language section at Woluwé, voicing their concern and asking the fundamental question as to whether a fourth German language section would be set up in Brussels at all, and whether the German section would be forced to move from Woluwé to Laeken."
"These are questions about questions, not just questions about money."
"I would ask the Commissioner to tell us how he is dealing with these misgivings on the part of parents."
". Mr President, once again I must say that a lot of these questions – or at least some of these questions – should not be addressed to me but to the board of governors."
"I know about the problem of overcrowded schools in Brussels very well because when I started my work I was immediately made aware of the urgent need for additional schools."
"I therefore approached the Belgian authorities, who provide the schools, and asked them to speed up the process of building a new school."
"A very interesting picture emerged."
"We have a school, we have three categories of pupils, we have category 3 pupils, and we at the Commission say that there has been an increase in the number of officials in the European institutions with children and we have to provide these children with normal conditions in schools, but in fact they cannot go to these schools because they are overcrowded and the schools themselves have taken in a lot of category 3 pupils."
"The Commission has asked the board of governors several times to suspend the enrolment of category 3 pupils until the opening of the fourth school in Laeken, but this has constantly been rejected."
"It is very interesting; the European institutions are providing money and asking for good conditions for their children in return, but the board of governors is deciding otherwise and they are deciding whom to take and whom not to take."
"Therefore, we have a controversial situation."
"The Belgian authorities ask us to clarify the situation ourselves among the institutions, and then we can talk because they are the same finances."
"In Brussels, there is a very big concentration of officials in European institutions."
"One aspect which has not been touched on at all so far is relations with the local authorities."
"This is another big issue and one that I do not want to raise."
"So, please, provide your support, let us take the same line with all the institutions and make it very clear that we need clear policy guidelines on this issue, more transparent management and more transparent decision-making on all these issues."
"What about multilingualism?"
"From my point of view, I can only assure you that I come from a very small country, and multilingualism and linguistic problems are very serious for small nations."
"I can only promote multilingualism, and we will try to find solutions to allow the continuation of teaching in all languages that are in use and to ensure that children can learn in national languages as much as possible."
"That is the main issue."
"Somebody raised the question of whether these schools are like ghettos or some place that nobody wants to go."
"I investigated this issue a little in Brussels."
"Of course, the schools are considered to be good ones and are very attractive."
"That is the reason why there is a very clear desire to have people from outside."
"It was very interesting to hear that there is some doubt about the question of institutions that are not European institutions that can provide places for category 1 pupils for their officials; we will definitely examine this question."
"Regarding Karlsruhe, I understand that you do not expect me to give immediate oral answers, but, as you asked, this can be also answered through the written procedure."
"I will do that with pleasure and will definitely provide all information concerning the Karlsruhe school."
"Regarding the specific question raised about the discrimination of pupils with special needs: according to the information I have, no discrimination was discovered, but there was just the question of how to cover all costs for this particular case."
"Parents were asked to provide some additional financing."
"Of course, we have a special allowance for children with special educational needs, but sometimes we have asked for additional resources from parents in this particular case."
"That is the information available to me."
"I would emphasise that this schools issue is a very serious issue and I can promise you that the Commission takes it very seriously."
"But let us also clarify the whole landscape: what is going on in this whole entity concerning possible decision-making?"
"How are decisions made, how are strategies defined?"
"In this particular case, again, as in many different cases, a responsibility is being asked of players who are not so directly involved in decision-making."
"So the responsibility for the consequences is in one place and the decision-making in another."
"Of course, financial matters are also very serious."
"As I have said before, especially concerning education and cultural issues, people sometimes say that we are again talking about finances but nothing can be done."
"Finances are a kind of common denominator, and in this particular case I must say that we are not satisfied with the current system of financial organisation of this entity."
"You know as well as I do that these things can explode and can have very dangerous consequences, as we have seen in the European institutions, and they can do enormous damage to the image of our undertakings."
"So, on this particular point also, I would like to ask for your support when we have certain proposals on how to clarify, for example, fiscal management, as we have done in several other cases."
"Of course, on the question of agencies, there is an enormous desire to establish new agencies and new institutions everywhere in Europe."
"I absolutely agree with the opinion that the educational aspects can also be considered, and so the Commission certainly asks for Parliament's support, and asks Parliament to be very cautious and to investigate all these proposals on all the possible consequences very carefully, including the consequences for the development of the system of European schools."
"Mr President, I am afraid that the Commissioner is misinformed in relation to the question of discrimination."
"The summary of the Ombudsman's recommendation of 27 May 2005 stated that: 'The Ombudsman found that the financial aspects of the situation constituted an unjustified discrimination and made a draft recommendation that the Commission should take the necessary steps to ensure that parents of special educational needs children who are excluded from the European school because of their degree of disability should not be required to contribute to the educational costs of their children.'"
"They found clear discrimination."
"I would ask the Commissioner to address that fact and to provide me with his opinion in writing."
"The Commission has taken note of your question, to which you will receive a reply."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the Commission Statement – the Northern Dimension."
"Commissioner Michel has the floor on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted about the opportunity offered to us in this Chamber to debate the policy relating to the Northern Dimension and to do so in advance of the meeting of ministers on 21 November, which will be devoted to this issue."
"The Northern Dimension is an integrated policy of the European Union."
"Its purpose is to encourage dialogue and practical cooperation in the northern parts of Europe comprising the Baltic region and the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas of our continent."
"It is designed to ensure the general well-being of this vast region endowed with many natural resources and to do so by means of effective and long-lasting regional cooperation."
"It also makes it possible to overcome the divisions experienced within a region whose constituent parts have very many shared characteristics and which has to face common challenges on both sides of the borders of the states concerned."
"Northern Dimension policy has moved on considerably since its launch in 1999, when it was officially inaugurated by the Helsinki European Council."
"The Feira European Council of June 2000 then incorporated the initial action plan for the Northern Dimension, extending over the period 2000-2003, into the European Union’s external and cross-border policies."
"The Brussels European Council of October 2003 supported the second action plan in favour of the Northern Dimension, which entered into force on 1 January 2004 and covers the period 2004-2006."
"This second plan took account of the European Union’s enlargement, set for 1 May 2004."
"Since that date, eight of the nine Baltic Sea states have been members of the European Union. The ninth is the Russian Federation."
"Even before that, Northern Dimension policy had placed ever greater emphasis upon relations and cooperation with North-West Russia, an aspect that will certainly be reinforced in the years after 2006."
"The second action plan relates to five areas deemed essential to the northern countries: the economic side of trade and infrastructure, the development of human resources – education, culture, research and health – the environment and nuclear safety, cross-border cooperation and, finally, justice and home affairs."
"Moreover, Kaliningrad and the Arctic are considered as cross-disciplinary themes to be integrated into the five priorities."
"The action plan emphasises the notions of subsidiarity and of dynamic interplay between the various actors in the Northern Dimension."
"These two ideas guarantee full participation by all the parties in implementing the action plan, the parties concerned being, in particular, the partner states, the regional organisations, the regional and local authorities, the educational establishments and research institutes and, finally, civil society, not forgetting the EU itself."
"In particular, I should like to stress the importance of the role played by the CBSS (Council of Baltic Sea States) and the BEAC (Barents Euro-Arctic Council), as well as the councils’ activities and projects."
"The Commission is a member of these two organisations and remains fully involved with them."
"Since the beginning, the initiatives adopted within the framework of the Northern Dimension have been implemented thanks to the existing Community programmes or to the respective budgets of the parties concerned with this dimension, whether they be states or regional organisations."
"At present, the European Union’s financial instruments devoted to Northern Dimension policy are the TACIS programmes, the national and regional programmes, including what are known as the neighbourhood programmes, Interreg and, to a lesser degree, the other Community policies affecting the Northern Dimension indirectly."
"The Northern Dimension also benefits from the greater scope for loans granted to Russia by the European Investment Bank."
"The Commission has proposed that, as from 2007, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, that is to say one of the four new instruments for funding external actions, constitute the main source of Community funding for Russia and, hence, for Northern Dimension policy."
"The institutional framework put in place by the second action plan has operated as anticipated, with ministerial meetings organised every two years and, in between, meetings of senior officials."
"The first meeting of senior officials took place in Brussels on 21 October 2004 and brought the following together: all the states involved with the Northern Dimension, together with all the other Member States of the European Union; the four Northern region organisations, that is to say the Council of Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, the Nordic Council of Ministers and the Arctic Council; the international financial institutions operating in Northern Europe; and representatives of the European Union institutions."
"Canada and the United States have also taken part as observers."
"The 2005 ministerial meeting, which will be held on 21 November in Brussels on the initiative of the British Presidency, will be important as its purpose will be to approve the guidelines for preparing a political statement and a framework document for implementing the policy to be considered in the years following 2006, that is to say upon expiry of the second action plan."
"According to the Commission, the main objective must be to make Northern Dimension policy a policy common to all the parties concerned, notably the Russian Federation."
"If this new Northern Dimension policy is to be a success, all the parties, and Russia in particular, need to feel fully involved."
"That also presupposes an unqualified commitment to the objectives and structures concerned with this dimension."
"Once all the parties have demonstrated this commitment, we could envisage new partnerships in the Northern region, inspired by the successful model provided by the environmental partnership in the Northern Dimension, for which the European Union is the main provider of funds and which illustrates the very fruitful cooperation established between the four international financial institutions concerned, Russia and the Commission."
"From the Commission’s point of view, the new Northern Dimension must be considered as the form of regional expression to the north of the Common Spaces agreed at the summit on 10 May between the European Union and the Russian Federation – regional expression that would be enhanced by full participation on the part of Norway and Iceland."
"It should also continue to include a number of additional objectives related to the specific characteristics of the North, in particular its fragile environment and the issue of native populations, as well as issues of health and social well-being."
"The Commission is at present preparing the basic documents concerning the new Northern Dimension."
"These should consist of a common political statement and a strategic framework setting out the objectives and listing the measures required for achieving them."
"These documents should be approved during the second half of 2006 following a very extensive process of consultation involving everyone concerned with this dimension, in particular the four northern region organisations, the international financial institutions operating in this same region, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"The documents should enter into force in 2007 upon expiry of the second action plan."
"The political statement and strategic framework related to the new dimension should be permanent in character, replacing the current model of three-year action plans while necessarily remaining subject to regular review."
"By way of facilitating these periodic reviews, the idea is also that, in future, everyone involved in the Northern Dimension should present assessments at the Northern Dimension ministerial meetings."
"The consultations on the new strategy have begun, and I am delighted at the opportunity they offer me to exchange views with Parliament."
"The Commission will gladly listen to any new idea or suggestion from Parliament about the development of this strategy and will also keep Parliament fully informed of this development."
"As for the Commission, it will continue to prepare annual reports."
"The information system concerning the Northern Dimension is also available on the Relex DG web site."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude by expressing the hope that the discussions we are currently conducting with Russia will lead to Russia committing itself unreservedly to the new phase on which the Northern Dimension strategy will embark in 2007."
"I also wish to emphasise that the Commission is fully determined to go on working to make this strategy succeed, both by implementing the second action plan and by developing the strategy."
". Mr President, it is excellent that the Northern Dimension is once again entering the debate, and I am very encouraged by Commissioner Michel’s eagerness to commit to its development."
"When you look at the list of speakers, however, you notice one substantial problem associated with this concept: up till now the Northern Dimension has been the concern of far too few people."
"Too few in Parliament and the EU Member States feel it has to do with them."
"The programme has not yet produced the results that were hoped for, and many people still know very little about it."
"This major initiative of the Finnish Presidency in 1999 is far too worthwhile a project to be lost simply because of a lack of political clout."
"The Northern Dimension must be made more viable, and I am grateful that a Member of the Commission should have the same objective."
"Apart from attracting very little attention, the Northern Dimension has been given very little money."
"Not having its own budget line, it has remained theoretical."
"If sums are compared with the financing which the EU has provided for the Mediterranean, they obviously amount to just a fraction of that, but I am delighted to hear about new financial instruments."
"The Northern Dimension has suffered from a certain lack of identity, and so far has been unable to create a clear profile for itself that distinguishes it from other programmes."
"We should be realistic: only a strategy with a clear financial framework and a budget line will succeed in establishing its status."
"This is one reason why some of us representatives of the Nordic countries have recently been looking in the direction of the Baltic Sea and the countries on its coastline."
"The Baltic Sea is unquestionably part of the Northern Dimension."
"With the eastward enlargement of the EU, the Baltic became almost completely an internal sea of the European Union, and it should be accorded the importance it deserves."
"It is our sea: ."
"Surrounding it are new Member States of the EU which are highly motivated to strengthen cooperation in the Baltic region so that all the important elements of the Northern Dimension are reinforced and new political muscle is used for regional cooperation."
"The Northern Dimension has been a tool of external relations, but the separate elements of its sphere of operation have not benefited sufficiently from factors that would unite it."
"It now needs a new approach that would unify the region."
"This is where Baltic Sea conservation and development of the Baltic Sea economic region are important."
"When we first joined the EU it might have been enough if we were able to have an impact on verbal reality and at least some people repeated the words and ideas we expressed."
"That is no longer enough; as the Union expands and as, at the same time, the need is great, I want the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Sea strategy to become a research project that will benefit the people who live in the region and one of environmental conservation."
". Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for this communication."
"The enlarged European Union needs visibility in its various geographical regions."
"It is widely recognised in the European Union that there has to be visible action in the Mediterranean region to maintain people’s security and welfare and our continent’s steady and sustainable development."
"The Northern Dimension is a later arrival in the sphere of EU activity."
"It has been a part of Union policy, as decided by the Council, since the German Presidency in 1999."
"As has been said here, however, commitment to this policy on the part of the Commission and the Member States has been very unsatisfactory, and it was very interesting and satisfying to hear the Commissioner’s assurance that there is to be a change with regard to this issue."
"The EU’s most recent round of enlargement also raises the matter of the need for a new Eastern Dimension."
"The Northern Dimension is an umbrella arrangement designed to try to give attention not only to the Union’s northern regions but also to its northern neighbouring regions, in the form, for example, of practical cooperation with the northwestern part of Russia and the Arctic regions."
"The practical work of the Northern Dimension is based on partnerships in which the European Union and Russia, Norway and Iceland are participants."
"Canada, too, is involved in many projects."
"The practical work of the Northern dimension is based on partnerships, and the best example of this is the realisation of environmental partnerships and the way these have come about could serve as an example to all the other EU regional projects."
"In short, the contribution of EUR 75 million by the partnership countries and the EU has meant we have been able to start or we have planned environmental projects worth EUR 2 billion."
"This autumn a sewage works southwest of St Petersburg will be completed."
"It will have considerable importance for reducing the waste load in the Baltic Sea."
"In the future we will have to develop a Northern Dimension policy, get new bodies and agencies involved in it, and provide support for the work of earlier partners."
"As the Commissioner said, the Nordic Council of Ministers, the Council of the Baltic Sea States, and the Barents Euro-Arctic Regional Council are all important players in the Northern Dimension."
"Most important of all, however, is the Commission’s own commitment and that of the Member States."
"The Northern Dimension must be made a reality so that it can genuinely become a part of our common policy."
". Mr President, I wish to thank the Commissioner for his very full, descriptive statement on the Northern Dimension and also for sharing with us some of the thoughts about the future."
"It is about the future – what comes after 2006 – that there is much concern."
"Over the last six years, I have had the privilege to represent this Parliament on a number of parliamentary bodies in the Arctic, Barents and Baltic region."
"It is quite clear that our parliamentary colleagues on those bodies look to this Parliament and the European Union to provide a robust and functioning Northern Dimension policy."
"It is somewhat ironic that this is a policy that is normally played out at a regional level and it is therefore absolutely essential that it involves elected Members and all other stakeholders, as the Commissioner has said."
"However, it is a policy that tends to be set at the biannual ministerial meetings."
"Therefore this Parliament has sometimes suggested that some form of Northern Dimension forum, bringing in all the stakeholders and elected representatives, would be a good idea for the future."
"We must give this policy bottom-up motion so that it is really working and dynamic and represents the wishes of the area it is there to serve."
"Also, the original Northern Dimension had a wide vision of a policy from the Urals to Greenland, encompassing the Arctic and the subarctic region."
"It is right that we concentrate much effort on our relationship with Russia, and there is much that can be done there."
"If we have a dynamic St Petersburg, then the Baltic itself will be dynamic and that even reflects on trade in the area I know best – the north-east coast of the United Kingdom."
"So it can benefit all of us and we must take an interest."
"However, it must be a shared policy in partnership with Russia, not a covert way of directing some EU policy towards Russia."
"As has already been mentioned, we must also bring in our other partners, Norway and Iceland."
"The Norwegian Government has recently produced a very full policy document for discussion on the High North."
"It wants European Union involvement."
"We should respond to that."
"This fragile area of our world gives us the opportunity to cooperate with many partners and even to have dialogue with the US on climate change."
"We should seize that opportunity within a wider Northern Dimension policy."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Northern Dimension is both an issue of external relations and an internal matter."
"The Baltic Sea is a part of the Northern Dimension which is connected with both."
"As has already been said, since enlargement it has become almost entirely an internal sea of the EU."
"The Baltic is one of the most vulnerable areas of sea in the world, and at present it is in very poor shape."
"None of this is visible from the surface, however."
"The often repeated depressing fact is that the largest stretch of wasteland in Europe lies at the bottom of the Baltic Sea."
"It is actually a vast zone devoid of oxygen, where the basic living organisms have died."
"The Baltic is fairly large in area but it is shallow."
"The average depth is only 58 metres, while that of the Mediterranean, for example, is several kilometres."
"The pollution load reaching the Baltic, however, is high."
"Approximately 0.5% of the world’s people live in its catchment area, although around 10% of the world’s sea traffic passes through it."
"The number of oil consignments from ports in Russia in particular is increasing very rapidly."
"We know that a major oil tanker accident is a catastrophe wherever it may occur."
"In the Baltic Sea, however, the consequences would be vastly more disastrous and longer-term than in the Atlantic."
"Eutrophication in the Baltic is visible in the summer, for example, in the form of blue-green algae."
"The greatest cause of this is agriculture."
"Environmental toxicity levels are high: for example, levels of contamination in seals and white-tailed eagles are approximately five times greater than in the Atlantic."
"Some of these problems can only be solved in collaboration with Russia, but some, such as agricultural emissions, are matters the resolution of which is in the hands of the European Union and its Member States."
". Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union is like a boat, whose keel is in the Mediterranean Sea and whose mast is in the Baltic."
"Winds blow into its sails from every direction, not least from where our partners are in the Northern Dimension: Russia, Norway and Iceland."
"This is sometimes forgotten by our southern friends in the Mediterranean region."
"Russia is a rich country, where there are a lot of poor people."
"The country has drifted into a state of chaos, in a way which we humanists cannot behold with indifference: there are street children and prostitutes, criminals and terrorists, and there are huge environmental problems."
"Russia’s state of health is reflected in the fact that the country’s population is falling by a million a year."
"It would be good if the Commissioner put on headphones, as I do not suppose he understands Finnish."
"It is possible to help this neighbour state of the EU solve its problems with funding, for example, under TACIS and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership programmes, under the umbrella of the Northern Dimension."
"We need a new and better Northern Dimension action programme, which must be drafted together with Russia."
"Now that the good Commissioner is listening, I will continue."
"The Northern Dimension must not, however, be merely a matter of helping Russia: it needs to be a means of cooperation."
"There needs to be a belief in good intentions on either side."
"The Northern Dimension must also cover cooperation with oil-rich Norway and energy-rich Iceland."
"Its action plan should extend into the northern region to include Greenland and Alaska, to say nothing of the Barents Sea."
"In the same way, there should be closer cooperation with the regional councils."
"The fact that the EU does not always take part in the meetings of the Arctic Council, the Barents Council or the Barents Euro-Arctic Council says something about its indifferent approach to external relations in the development of the Northern Dimension."
"The Commission should take seriously the desire of the EU’s northern Member States to develop Europe’s northern regions alongside the Mediterranean region, and the Commissioner should listen to the debate through his headphones if he does not understand the language."
"Mr President, there is unfortunately a constant attempt to get involved in just about every area."
"We are to vote on many such objectionable proposals later today."
"When it comes to the Northern Dimension, it is therefore, in my view, very important for us to concentrate on results-oriented activity and not on everything under heaven and earth that is north of the fiftieth degree of latitude."
"What, then, is important in the Northern Dimension over the next ten or fifteen years?"
"Generally speaking, I agree entirely with all the previous speakers that the answer is the Baltic Sea."
"What is more, I would add that the nuclear plants outside Saint Petersburg give rise to one of those topical issues that are genuinely of extreme importance."
"It should be noted that, in both cases, Russia has a crucial role to play."
"It is a matter, therefore, of cultivating the contact we have with Russia and developing it in both these areas."
"The Baltic is an absolutely unique inland sea."
"There is no comparison with the Mediterranean or, indeed, any other sea in the world."
"The Baltic consists of brackish water, meaning that flora and fauna that are actually suited to salty sea water or fresh water are in constant danger."
"The salt content goes up or down depending on how the water flows through the Sound."
"That makes the Baltic incredibly sensitive because, as quite a few speakers have pointed out, it is a shallow sea."
"The Baltic cannot cope with pollution, yet around the Baltic there is now intensive economic activity and intensive agriculture with a host of discharges."
"This means that our efforts should be directed at, for example, rescuing flora and fauna, cleaning up after discharges, monitoring marine transport and closing down the Saint Petersburg nuclear plants."
". Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems that now, when the European Union has taken on a leading role in the realisation of the Northern Dimension, it is showing signs of being more like a business plan than a policy."
"Why?"
"In spite of the fact that it is welcome that the Northern Dimension is applied to the Baltic Sea region with the aim of developing cooperation both within the region and also in the border region from the Baltic Sea towards the east, and that efforts are being made to involve Russia, which is nurturing its understanding of western values, it is time to take a good look at how seriously Russia has taken the Northern Dimension itself and factors connected with it into account so far."
"It is quite obvious that in the wider context of the region Russia thinks predominantly of its own interests."
"This is proven by its inability to free itself of imperial thinking, based on Tsar Peter I’s approach to Europe, in the 17th century, of forcing a breach, continuing right up to its inability to accept the independence regained by the Baltic states and their equal membership of the Baltic Sea region within the context of development and security."
"As a result, the facilities developed in the Baltic Sea are completely inadequate in terms of meeting the Northern Dimension’s goals: for example, the transport and energy systems and the new ports at St Petersburg, which not only complicate the environmental situation, but make it more expensive for European Union consumers to obtain natural resources in the northern region."
"As a result, ships and tankers’ routes are lengthening, traffic in the Baltic Sea is continuing to increase and in the near future will double or treble, the cost of raw materials is increasing and there are growing risks of shipping collisions in the Baltic Sea."
"All this should be taken into account."
"I would also like to place particular emphasis on the fact that Russia has a special need to foster democracy, since, unfortunately, it is absolutely clear that the current Russian regime is ignoring this extremely important objective."
"Only once Russia has managed to solve these problems will we be able to hope that the Northern Dimension will achieve its technical and economic objectives in relation to Russia."
"Mr President, I would like to start by making a point to the people who prepare the European Parliament agendas and also to the English interpretation booth."
"Today we are talking about the Dimension, not the Dimension."
"There is a rather substantial difference."
"There are four Nordic countries; the Northern Dimension encompasses the whole north of Europe."
"It is important to remember that when drawing up the agenda next time."
"I think that the Northern Dimension stands at a crossroads."
"It has two options."
"One is that it withers away under the Russian road map and becomes just a part of it."
"The second is that we start refocusing it, for instance towards the Baltic Sea."
"I happen to have a preference for the second option."
"I am very happy that the Commission is dealing with the matter today and that we are able to discuss it."
"I am also very happy to see that there are other non-Finns in the Chamber besides Mrs Wallis, who was the only non-Finn to speak about the subject in November 2003."
"So the concept is moving forward and that is a good thing."
"I would like to make three observations."
"Firstly, I think that the Northern Dimension should have its own budget line."
"I firmly believe that it needs it."
"If it is put under the neighbourhood policy I think it will only get crumbs from the general budget."
"So give it its own budget line."
"Secondly, I think we need to rejuvenate the Northern Dimension, give it more content than before."
"The ideas that Commissioner Michel put forward are a step in the right direction."
"However, I fully agree with, for example, Mrs Korhola and Mrs Hassi, who said that we should refocus it on the Baltic Sea, because that probably is the sickest sea we have in Europe today."
"To all the people sitting in the Parliament for the first time today, just remember that the Baltic Sea has an average depth of 59 metres compared to the two to three kilometres of the Mediterranean."
"If there were to be an oil accident, that would be the end of the Baltic Sea, and I am sure no one would like to see that happen."
"So let us get more focus."
"Thirdly, we need to start coordinating the institutions that are dealing with the Northern Dimension and the Baltic Sea region."
"We need more coordination between the Nordic Council, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and the Baltic Sea Council."
"They need to work together."
"I want to ask the Commissioner one final question."
"Do you not think it would be a good idea to have a Northern Dimension as the overarching concept, but a Baltic Sea strategy as an underlying theme working within the Northern Dimension?"
"Mr President, the Northern Dimension has served as a useful framework for cooperation across national borders and, in particular, across the EU’s external border with Russia."
"It has a considerable importance for this sort of cooperation between people and various organisations, and it has importance specifically for regional security, welfare and stability."
"The Northern Dimension should be included in all the EU’s policies and not remain a separate heading."
"It was good to hear that the Commissioner agrees."
"Whether it is a matter of the environment, health or culture, everything also has its northern dimension in the same way the EU’s policy on the Mediterranean does."
"The EU’s northeastern border is at least as crucially important as its border in the southern Mediterranean."
"The standard-of-living gap in the north is the widest in Europe."
"On the Russian side, the economic and health statistics are on a par with Africa."
"HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis, drugs and alcoholism have lowered life expectancy in males to levels in the developing countries."
"Of the hundreds of projects, those which stand out most clearly are the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership and the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being."
"The aim of the latest programme is the control of these infectious diseases and the prevention of various dangers to society in our neighbouring areas: which will be no minor feat in the future either."
"Mr President, the EU’s best investments in the environment and in health are still being made behind Finland’s eastern border, and it is on that border that the interests of the whole of the EU are being watched over above all by the Finns."
"Mr President, the Commission’s report shows that the importance of the Northern Dimension in the Union’s external relations is growing in strength."
"Especially gratifying is the fact that Russia’s attitude towards it is becoming more positive than what it was before."
"In order to develop the Northern Dimension’s importance in the Union’s external relations the Commission should be given two tasks."
"Firstly, not only Russia but also our northern European Economic Area partners, Iceland and Norway, should be strongly encouraged to be involved in cooperation in the northern regions and, for example, the new EU Neighbourhood Policy."
"Secondly, the Commission should participate more dynamically in the work of the councils that operate in the northernmost region of the earth: the Council of the Baltic Sea States, the Barents Euro-Arctic Council, and the Arctic Council."
"My main message, however, is connected with what is missing from the Commission’s report entirely: cooperation in the Baltic Sea region."
"Until spring of last year, the Baltic countries and Poland were our neighbours and partners in external relations."
"Now they have joined the Union the development of the Baltic Sea region is essentially based on mutual cooperation between the Member States and the Union’s internal policy."
"The Commission needs to take this into account when shaping the guidelines for the Northern Dimension."
"Now that our Northern Dimension partners have gone from just being neighbours to being members, a comprehensive strategy for developing the Baltic Sea region should be drawn up, within the framework of which the Member States and the Commission can collaborate on projects such as improving environmental conservation and the energy economy in the region as well as its internal communications."
"Baltic Sea cooperation will establish the Northern Dimension in the Union’s internal policies, but cooperation with Russia will obviously still be conducted as part of the Northern Dimension of external relations."
"Baltic Sea cooperation will finally contribute some real substance to those views of the Council which have emphasised the importance of the Northern Dimension generally and also in the internal development of the Union."
"There should be some reorganisation in the Commission so that it is not only the External Relations Directorate-General that deals with questions relating to the Northern Dimension but other Directorate-Generals as well."
"Mr President, it is indeed timely that we should be discussing the Northern dimension in this House."
"I also join with others in saluting the initiative taken by the Finnish Government."
"It is also good to remark, as colleagues have said, that this debate is attended by French, German, Austrian, Belgian, British and other colleagues."
"It is timely, as has been said, that we extend the work of the Northern Dimension to encompass a Baltic Sea strategy, which is a true reflection of today's reality, the Baltic bordered by eight EU Member States and the Russian Federation."
"In this Parliament there is a Baltic Europe intergroup, which meets every month in Strasbourg and which I have the honour to chair."
"It encompasses members not only from each political group but also representing the great majority of Member States."
"We have been working to produce a Baltic Sea strategy."
"Yesterday we had the honour to meet with President-in-Office and Minister for Europe Mr Alexander."
"We are extremely grateful for his enthusiasm and interest in the project leading up to the ministerial meeting on 21 November on the Northern dimension."
"Commissioner Michel, I would urge you – perhaps in your reply – just to confirm that the Commission, you and your colleagues will be working extremely closely with the British Presidency to ensure the successful initiation and implementation of the Baltic Sea strategy, which will be seen as a natural extension – a complement – to the work of the Northern Dimension."
"I wholly agree with others, that we shall have a discreet budget line for the Baltic Sea strategy to match and balance the very successful work that we do through the Euromed policy, which – obviously – historically predates the work in the Baltic."
"The scope of this work cannot be underestimated: its importance ranks in the very highest policy that the EU should now be developing."
"What we are talking about is nothing less than offsetting and overcoming half a century of Soviet occupation, oppression, misrule and marginalisation."
"We are pledged to restore the economic harmony, security, prosperity and cultural vibrancy of the Baltic region."
"To ensure the success of this work, it is absolutely vital that the British, German, Polish, French and Italian Governments and the whole of the EU administration lend their support to this great work."
"We want to see a truly successful enlarged European Union."
"That will not happen unless we have a successful Baltic Sea strategy."
"Mr President, I shall begin by thanking the Commissioner for his encouraging presentation, and I shall continue in Swedish."
"Last year’s enlargement of the EU has a very great effect upon the Northern Dimension."
"The Baltic Sea region, which comprises all of eight Member States, now forms the very heart of the Northern Dimension."
"It is a region with great potential for economic development and urgent challenges in, for example, the area of environmental policy, which must become part of the agenda for the whole of the EU."
"The people there expect a policy that makes it possible to make full use of the region’s potential, a factor that must also be taken into account in the EU’s policy on Russia."
"When the European Parliament set up what are known as its intergroups, the group that was to deal with the Baltic region as a whole was one of the most popular, which is a sign of just how much demand there is for such cooperation."
"That being said, there is a lack of shared awareness and, consequently, of solidarity and a common sense of identity in the region."
"We must now take steps to heal this wound following the division of Europe."
"The Baltic must become a matter for the whole of the EU."
"A flourishing EU needs a flourishing Baltic region, and the region needs the EU in order to be able to solve a range of problems, environmental as well as social and economic."
"It is also important for Russia to get involved in the cooperation taking place under the banner of the Northern Dimension."
"It would be of symbolic importance to support Saint Petersburg so that, in future, all the waste water from the city might be cleaned up, so benefiting everyone living in the Baltic region."
"The population of that region expects such obvious problems to be solved."
"It is unfortunate that the Northern Dimension has often been seen as an issue internal to Finland."
"It is also regrettable that Baltic cooperation, which is important, has in a way fallen outside the Northern Dimension, in spite of the fact that Baltic cooperation is an essential part of that dimension."
"It is important for the Commission to succeed now in properly strengthening the Baltic side of the Northern Dimension."
"It must be possible to do a better job of coordinating research in the region and directing it at issues of common concern."
"Important infrastructure projects can bind the region together."
"We also need an extensive exchange of students and labour."
"Energy supplies must become more diverse."
"My message to the Commissioner is this: incorporate the Baltic as an important part of the Northern Dimension."
"Draw up a bold strategy for the region, and be more daring."
"Mr President, I am encouraged by the Commissioner's fresh approach to this topic."
"For me, the Northern dimension was an ambitious initiative when it was proposed by the Finnish Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, eight years ago."
"Under the first Finnish Presidency it succeeded in turning the EU's attention towards north-eastern Europe."
"Today, the Baltic Sea has become an internal sea of the EU, uniting an extremely promising region of 85 million inhabitants with immense economic potential."
"I should like to make three observations."
"My first concern is related to the highly alarming ecological situation of the Baltic Sea, where environmental and toxic hazards are often up to five times higher than in the North Sea area."
"These growing risks and challenges need to be addressed by more cohesive and long-term policies, using the resources of the EU as a whole."
"It is high time, therefore, to widen the concept of the Northern dimension beyond cooperation projects with Russia's north-west regions, to cover the whole area of the Baltic Sea including the Kaliningrad area."
"Secondly, within the Northern dimension, we should have a special Baltic Sea strategy, just as there is an EU strategy for the Mediterranean."
"The time has come to draw practical conclusions from the enlargement of the EU to the east and north-east."
"Clearly, we need a much more creative and balanced approach to these areas, including the creation of concrete financial instruments."
"Thirdly, one of the core elements of the Northern dimension is cooperation with Russia."
"The efficiency and reliability of the EU common foreign policy are being particularly tested in this region."
"Despite the European Parliament's May resolution on Russia, which called on Member States to resist Russia's attempts to differentiate between old and new Members, unfortunately the date of 8 September stands as a symbol of the separate relations between Russia and some larger Member States."
"The so-called Schröder-Putin agreement will officially start the building of a new under-sea gas pipeline between Germany and Russia, solidifying the special relationship between those two countries."
"The side effect of that project would be to expose Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine to the Russian practice of using economic pressure to advance its foreign policy aims."
"If its long-term cooperation with Russia is to be successful, the EU needs to start sending a clear and coherent signal to Moscow."
"Our first priority must be to convince Russian policy-makers that we take our own common foreign policy seriously."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the fact that Europe is home to almost 500 million people has made it the part of the world with the greatest purchasing power, and that makes the sort of strategy that we are discussing today especially important."
"Purchasing power has not only advantages but also disadvantages, and so we have to consider in what areas we want to include this new dimension."
"I would like to draw particular attention to energy policy."
"I regard the Baltic region in particular as a region with a future, and as one that is of the utmost importance to us."
"Countries such as Norway, with its reserves of crude oil and natural gas, and Iceland, with its renewable geothermal energy, are examples for us to follow in this respect and present us with an immense opportunity to develop common strategies for energy policy in this area;"
"I believe that the current state of energy prices – for both oil and gas – means that this will be one of the most important issues in the future."
"Not only in that respect, but also as regards the security of our energy supply, this area will, in future, have a special part to play."
"When I say that the infrastructure, too, presents us with a vitally important challenge, I am referring not only to the energy infrastructure, but also to such things as telecommunications."
"Tasks such as developing broadband technology and ensuring access to information on the Internet by a wider cross-section of society will in future have an important part to play in the future, particularly in remote regions."
"A primary concern in cross-border cooperation is economic in nature – to bring together small and medium-sized businesses."
"The need to create jobs and to attempt to raise the standard of living in these regions make it particularly important that our promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises in particular, and of cooperation above all, should take no account of borders."
"That brings me on to a really fundamental issue, that of the WTO and Russia."
"I believe it to be crucial to the Hong Kong talks in particular that we should join together with Russia in considering a common strategy as regards global lawmaking."
"I regard this dimension as being of particular importance to us in terms of our trade relations, and the importance to Europe of the further development of the WTO structures will be consistent with this."
"A very interesting debate is currently going on in this region about how we can join together in adapting to the new situations in the global context, and that I see as being the real challenge for Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Parliament for the great interest it has expressed in this Chamber for a subject that is clearly important."
"I should also like to thank the speakers who, overall, reacted very positively to the statement I made on behalf of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"I should like to point out that it is she who deserves the credit because I was speaking on her behalf, and I shall be sure to convey this general feeling of support to her."
"I shall also pass on all the suggestions and reflections expressed that do not necessarily relate to the statement, in particular those concerning the place and role of Russia and cooperation with that country."
"The Russian economy shows encouraging growth, so it is likely that European Union budgets will not increase in this area."
"However, the Commission does not dismiss the possibility of new partnerships if Russia commits itself formally to the Northern Dimension."
"I would just add that, in my view, the comparison with the Mediterranean is not entirely appropriate, given the different characteristics of the two regions, particularly with regard to economic indicators, the populations concerned and the number of countries involved etc."
"To return to Russia, the Commission is receptive to that country’s proposals and contributions."
"Russia needs to be present at the ministerial meeting about the Northern Dimension, to be held on 21 November 2005, and then to participate fully in the entire range of the Northern Dimension’s activities."
"Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union, as witnessed to by the positive conclusions of the summit of 10 May and by the adoption of the road maps for the four Common Spaces."
"Our objective consists of devising a joint European Union-Russia policy on the Northern Dimension, also involving Norway and Iceland."
"This policy should be in keeping with the Common Spaces, with which it should be aligned in terms of the Northern region, and it should have a number of specific characteristics."
"I shall now say something about specific funding."
"I think that the European Community should continue to support the Northern Dimension within the framework of the programmes at present being implemented, that is to say TACIS and the European Neighbourhood Policy, and of those to be implemented in the future within the framework of the draft European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"It should also be noted that what will also be useful in terms of infrastructure is the fact that the opportunities for loans by the European Investment Bank to Russia and the western NIS (newly independent states) have recently been increased."
"Thanks to the practical support froma wide range of donors, the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnershipis showing how useful it is for meeting very specific and urgent needs."
"It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that these results could be reproduced in other areas, but that would require a similar level of commitment from all those providing funds."
"Because it is important, I need to reply to a question I was asked several times, namely that concerning a Baltic strategy within the Northern Dimension."
"That option obviously has its merits. However, I think that we should, for all that, point out that the Commission is active around the Baltic Sea through the EU’s internal policies."
"The fact is that, as I mentioned earlier, eight of the nine countries bordering the Baltic are Member States, benefiting from the EU’s internal policies and programmes."
"There can be no forgetting the far North with its specific characteristics: relatively unpopulated, but with a very large native culture and environmental problems peculiar to itself."
"Those, then, are the replies we intended giving today. Obviously, though, I shall be very particular in conveying the feelings, reflections and very strong commitment of the MEPs who spoke in this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"I have listened to this debate with interest, yet not taken part, much like the country I represent, Scotland."
"The Scottish Parliament has complete competence in areas like Fisheries, the Environment and several other areas relevant to the Northern Dimension."
"Sadly, we have had little input to the development of this policy, though I do hope that that will change."
"We have much to contribute from our own experience, and much to learn as a West-Nordic nation."
"I today make a plea to the European Commission to remember us in their planning, and to the Scottish government to play a more active part alongside our neighbours Iceland, Norway and others."
"The next item is the report (A6-0173/2005) by Mr Thierry Cornillet, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on tourism and development [2004/2212(INI)]."
"Mr President, tourism is the largest global economic activity, both in terms of turnover and number of jobs."
"It is one of the most dynamic sectors in the world, true though it is that it is extremely volatile and very sensitive, particularly in the wake of attacks. Think of those of 11 September, which brought tourist development to a sudden halt."
"Developing countries were the first to suffer from this reversal."
"The tourist economy characteristically cuts across an extremely wide range of areas. It naturally leads to the development of hotels, together with other forms of accommodation, such as self-catering cottages and family-run guest houses, that are outside the hotel system proper."
"It enables staff to be trained not only in the professions associated with the hotel and catering industry but also in languages. It makes for extremely wide-ranging economic activity, with all types of salespeople eager to respond to the demands of, for example, people who have forgotten their toothpaste or medicines or who want croissants to eat every morning in their hotel."
"Tourist development has bearing upon all areas of the food industry, not to mention, of course, all the souvenir shops there are."
"What is more, tourism in itself generates a very heavy demand for substantial forms of infrastructure, most prominent among which are not only airports but also sea ports and main roads, as well as smaller roads serving tourist destinations and other places to visit."
"Moreover, tourism encourages specific demand affecting areas over which the state traditionally has jurisdiction, be it in matters of security or public health."
"I shall return to this point."
"By the way in which it cuts across such a variety of areas, tourism therefore guarantees genuine economic development, but it does not stop there."
"Tourism also makes for land conservation and better protection of the environment, the fact of the matter being that, with the creation of world heritage sites, we now give serious thought to areas that are to be protected, without however being set piously apart, so enabling them to be exploited ‘intelligently’ for tourist purposes."
"Tourism is also a factor in democracy and political stability because tourists with no intention of being bound by any all-inclusivepackage see a country open up before them; because tourism is enriching and is educational in a way that, as everyone knows, undermines dictatorship; because tourism can establish ethical rules, particularly regarding child labour; and because the idea of fair tourism, which in fact constitutes a form of dissuasion, is beginning to make itself felt in our part of the world."
"Finally, tourism is an essential factor in public health and education."
"Health risks constitute absolutely the wrong type of advertising."
"Remember the problem of Ebola virus in Congo and elsewhere. The same applies, however, to malaria and makes states much more sensitive to the need to eradicate these diseases."
"Tourism is extremely demanding in terms of decent hospital infrastructure which, of course, will also serve the local population."
"Finally, tourism is an educational factor because it makes people learn languages and in that way opens people’s minds."
"Let us not deceive ourselves."
"Tourism can also be a factor causing disturbance and leading to abuse."
"I shall give just two examples."
"The first is sex tourism, which is clearly a means of development for certain countries that do not provide themselves with the resources for preventing it."
"The second is property speculation, in particular that whereby leading families buy up properties or that whereby, if one is not careful, sites are destroyed."
"The fact that tourism is the world’s largest form of economic activity and that it can be an economic lever for developing countries cannot be a matter of indifference to the European Union."
"Tourism must therefore be better integrated into all forms of the aid we offer."
"That naturally applies to all our programmes, be they the EDF, MEDA, ASEAN or other programmes."
"The percentage of these funds directly appropriated to tourist development projects must be increased."
"We ourselves must strengthen our own structures."
"I am glad that Mr Michel is in the Chamber, because what I have just said applies not only to the Enterprise DG but also to the Development DG, both of which should have tourism departments with a bit more clout."
"We need help in strengthening the public-private partnership."
"Let us not delude ourselves. The public sector will not take care of tourist development in its entirety."
"Through the aid it supplies through ourselves and through the impetus it provides, in particular for the creation of major infrastructure, the public sector can, however, help tourism develop further."
"Finally, tourism must give rise to ethical reflection within the European Union and, more generally, at global level."
"To prevent corruption and merciless speculation in all its forms, help should not be given to just anyone, anywhere."
"Thought needs to be given to ways of putting a stop to sex tourism and, in particular, to the forms of legal action available to us in our own countries."
"Particularly when it comes to child labour, we need to be sure about the situation regarding working conditions and public freedoms within developing countries."
"Tourism, which encourages knowledge of other people and the exchange of experiences, offers a promising route for developing countries to go down."
"Finally, visitors to other countries are perhaps more aware than others of the urgent need there is to increase and channel international aid."
"The presence of that aid becomes apparent."
"Having seen evidence of it, people take an interest; and, having taken an interest, they give in a much more visible way."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome the in-depth work that has been done on the drawing up of this report and the resolution on tourism and development that is packed with interesting ideas."
"As the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, has noted, the Development Directorate-General, which is under my authority, has no specialised service for tourism issues."
"That obviously does not mean, though, that there are no projects in this sector."
"Furthermore, in his explanatory statement, the rapporteur points to the significant funding from the European Development Fund in the sector."
"The Commission deals with the issue of tourism in the developing countries from the point of view of aid for the private sector and the sustainable management of natural resources."
"Tourist promoters in the developing countries therefore have all the instruments for aid to the private sector available to them."
"The investment facility managed by the European Investment Bank has thereby funded several hotel projects in the ACP countries, while the PROINVEST programme provides the sector with non-financial support, such as the strengthening of capacities and the promotion of investments."
"Furthermore, the European Development fund has funded hotel training schools in numerous countries to accompany the rapid development of the tourism sector."
"Furthermore, road, port and airport investments funded by the European Development Fund play a crucial role in the development of tourism, as well as water supply, electrification, sanitation, waste treatment and environmental conservation programmes."
"Furthermore, the ecolabel system, promoted by the Commission, enables tourism entrepreneurs to obtain a label certifying that their tourism company respects environmental standards, which is important for the ecotourism market."
"It is therefore very difficult to isolate purely tourist projects."
"The report acknowledges the transversal nature of the sector."
"I entirely agree with this idea."
"The European Union’s strategy consists of supporting the partners in their development efforts by helping them to enhance all the resources available to them, including tourism."
"In the case of the small island countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific, tourism is one of the only resources available."
"Furthermore, proper environmental management of ecosystems such as forests, coral reefs or rivers would allow these resources to be conserved and generate long-term revenue for the local population."
"I agree with the points of view expressed in points 1 and 2 relating to durable or sustainable tourism."
"The European Union’s cooperation with its partners is aimed at promoting sustainable development based on local resources and which is respectful of the environment."
"With regard to the increase in tourism projects advocated, I must point out that we must prevent the scattering of funding and, in order to achieve the maximum impact, the Commission, in agreement with the partner States, focuses its aid on a relatively limited number of sectors."
"These sectors are determined in joint agreement with the countries in question."
"Since tourism is essentially a private sector activity, the multiplication of tourist projects falls within the domain of promoters."
"For promoters in ACP countries, the Commission has established the Investment Facility, with a capital of EUR 2.2 billion, in order to respond to an increase in requests for funding."
"The Commission treats the participatory approach and the quest for adherence of the beneficiaries as one of the cardinal principles of its development policy."
"The private sector is consulted as recommended in point 15."
"As for the support for countries falling victim to natural disasters, this is already a constant of Community aid, as is the obligation to respect and protect the environment and local cultures."
"We share the concerns expressed in point 30 about the training of specialised personnel on the ground in the countries in question, and we would point out that this is precisely what the Commission has always favoured."
"In Madagascar, for example, the Commission has established a training project that is directed at both promoters and their employees."
"The Commission naturally agrees on the need vigorously to combat sex tourism, especially where the victims are children, in particular by providing the judicial systems of partner countries with all the assistance they need to eradicate this scourge."
"I would like to thank the European Parliament for the attention it has given the Commission’s services and you may rest assured that I will take all the necessary steps to ensure a more effective monitoring of all activities relating to tourism."
"Nevertheless, the Commission does not believe that a Directorate-General should be created solely responsible for tourism."
". – Mr President, no one doubts the importance of tourism as a central component in European development policy."
"Tourism, as the rapporteur rightly states in his report, is not only a factor of economic growth; it also makes a substantial contribution to democracy and political equilibrium in developing countries."
"Nonetheless, an effective EU policy of tourism to other countries depends on an integrated policy for sustainable European tourism within the European Union."
"I should like to link our debate today with the debate held on the guidelines for sustainable European tourism, because I believe that only if the European Union creates conditions of harmonious correlation between internal and external competence on tourism issues will it have an effective tourism policy for developing countries."
"In other words, ."
"Since the Treaty of Maastricht, tourism policy has been a central objective of the action of the European Union."
"With the European Constitution, tourism is reintegrated into the sectors of supporting, coordinating or complementary action by the Union."
"The legal basis therefore exists, as does the challenge to create a coordinated European policy of action in the tourism sector."
"The challenge of moving from the level of pronouncements to a cohesive and effective structural policy cofinanced by the Union, a policy of sustainable tourism, a source of economic development of both traditional and rural destinations, a source of knowledge of history and cultural heritage, a policy with specific strategic guidelines, clear objectives and linked objectives and means."
"A politically mature and institutionally perfect European policy for sustainable European tourism will also facilitate the smooth interconnection of European tourism policy with European development policy."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cornillet for his report, which highlights the importance of tourism and its potential in the developing world."
"When looking at the developing world, we have to remember that tourism plays more of a role in some regions and countries than in others; the figures in the report show that."
"In the Caribbean, tourism is a key driver of the economy, but that is not the case across sub-Saharan Africa where, with a few exceptions, tourism is not such a big factor."
"For that reason, the Socialist Group cannot support the report in its entirety."
"For example, we cannot support paragraph 8, which asks all developing countries to draft tourism development plans, to produce annual reports on figures and contributions, because that is not appropriate in all cases and in many countries it would be a pretty low priority."
"Nor can we agree with paragraph 10."
"At a time when the EU is demanding more and more visa controls from third country nationals, it seems a bit ironic that we then ask other countries to drop their visa requirements."
"Visas are often a major source of income for developing countries, so that is not something that we can support."
"There are also a couple of areas where the report could be more nuanced. For example, recitals Q and T. Experience shows that, unfortunately, it is quite possible for tourism to flourish alongside undemocratic regimes."
"Some of those regimes have proved good at protecting tourism and tourists with very strong-arm police tactics."
"However, they have at the same time been oppressing their own people, which is why I have reservations about paragraphs 24 and 25."
"We in the Socialist Group strongly support moves to develop tourism, particularly eco-tourism, sustainable tourism, and we welcome what the Commissioner said."
"We want the private sector to invest in tourism, but to do so responsibly, to develop tourism projects that contribute to the local economy and help micro-businesses to grow, so that local people benefit and local produce is consumed."
"In too many areas including, for example, all-inclusive packages and cruise tours, tourism takes out of local economies, but often does not put much back in."
"In some cases – and here I disagree with Mr Cornillet – it can damage the environment, using scarce resources too much."
"We need to look more carefully at the kind of tourism projects we want to invest in."
"Could the EU and the Commission do more?"
"I am sure they could, and we have heard some examples of what might be proposed."
"Do we need a new DG to do that?"
"I am not so sure."
"I am not sure that if we had a DG Tourism it would in any case do much for the developing world."
"I very much welcome the section on sex tourism."
"It is extremely important that we do a lot more to tackle this criminal activity, so thanks again to Mr Cornillet for his report."
". Mr President, this report by Mr Cornillet contains a plethora of valuable suggestions and justified demands."
"Most of the recitals are illuminating and critically enumerate a large number of problems, including child labour, the sexual exploitation of children and speculation in property."
"The Verts/ALE Group is glad to see this subject being discussed in this House at all and consideration being given to such aspects as the investment of profits from tourism in the developing country in question, the avoidance of mass tourism, the promotion of human rights and the maintenance of bio-diversity."
"We find it regrettable – and it is on this point that I largely agree with Mrs McAvan – that this document shows Europeans largely adopting an arrogant attitude towards third countries and regarding themselves as the measure of all things."
"We believe that the report attaches far too little weight, in this area, to the protection of the environment and to the need for a truly sustainable economy."
"Discussion of the ecological and social consequences of mass tourism, such as water pollution, the alienation of the local population, or exploitation on the part of multinational hotel chains is absent or too diffuse."
"As a first attempt, this report is important, but there are many things that it considers only half-heartedly or too vaguely."
"We hope that the Commission will go into the matters it has highlighted in greater depth, and that greater emphasis will be placed on international solidarity as a means of promoting peace."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we have to debate and vote on today is one that takes a wide-ranging approach to issues associated with the development of tourism, especially in developing countries."
"For that the rapporteur, Mr Cornillet, deserves our thanks."
"For many of the poorest countries in the world, tourism does of course represent an important potential source of income, and that is why it is to the credit of both the rapporteur and the Committee on Development that, in considering the use of tourism in association with projects to combat poverty, they do not lose sight of the millennium development goals."
"That is something I regard as very important."
"What prompts my fundamental criticism, though, is the way in which the report gives the impression that the EU is, as an outsider, announcing to the developing countries what they may and may not do."
"That I regard as improper."
"I do not think it right that the EU should interfere in the way the developing countries manage their visa policies."
"I do not think it legitimate that developing countries should be called on to submit reports to whomsoever, irrespective of what is then done with those reports."
"Nor, in my view, is a report of this kind the right place for the EU to demand the creation of special police units."
"There is no mistaking the EU’s assumption, expressed yet again in this report, that tourism will help to resolve all the world’s remaining problems."
"It is because that is something I regard as highly dubious that I welcome the tabling of the amendment calling for the deletion of recital Q, according to which tourism is the enemy of totalitarianism, dictators and over-centralised power."
"That is wishful thinking that bears no relation to reality."
"Like Mr Kusstatscher, though, I do find it regrettable that this report scarcely mentions the real ecological problems associated with mass tourism, at any rate not to such an extent as would make it possible to resolve them."
"The amendments adopted in the Development Committee mean that the report does now contain wordings advocating that, but they go against the fundamental tendency of the report as a whole."
"My Group will not therefore be able to endorse this report."
"Mr President, the emphatic ‘no’ delivered by the French and the Dutch to the EU Constitution demonstrated that broad swathes of the people we represent want to see less extensive, rather than broader, EU cooperation."
"The report proposes, among other things, that an independent Directorate General for Tourism should be set up within the Commission."
"That means more power for the EU, something to which the June List is opposed."
"It is true that a well-organised tourist sector has a lot of potential for helping improve the situation of people in many developing countries."
"The EU should not, however, conduct a common policy on tourism, as proposed in the report."
"We believe that the EU should only work on genuinely cross-border issues where it can add something of unique value not offered by already existing international organisations."
"This means that the EU should not devote itself to development policy and policy on tourism."
"Paragraph 10 calls on developing countries to introduce non-restrictive visa policies."
"That is a completely absurd proposal."
"Developing countries must of course decide for themselves what visa policies they wish to operate."
"Otherwise, developing countries should demand that the EU too introduce a non-restrictive visa policy."
"Paragraph 24 advocates that criminal activity in developing countries be combated in such a way as not to damage those countries’ image as tourist destinations."
"Should the EU dictate to other countries how criminal activity should be combated?"
"Paragraph 25 calls for tourism to be promoted, protected and secured through initiatives to tackle crime directed against tourism, with such initiatives to include the setting up of specially trained police units."
"Again, this is not a task for the EU."
"We are critical of the fact that paragraph 30 refers to the EU Constitution, which has already been rejected by the French and the Dutch."
"We advocate an EU with limited influence and shall accordingly vote against this report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cornillet report undoubtedly contains many valid points, when it, for example, explores the seamy side of certain forms of tourism, such as the sexual exploitation of children in certain tourist destinations or property exploitation that affects the indigenous – and often less well-off – population."
"There is, however, one important point missing from this report in my view, namely a clear position on tourism to countries where human rights are grossly violated and where it would be useful if the European Union were to consider introducing an embargo in order to exert more pressure on the countries concerned."
"An example of this was given a few months ago by Mr Deva, who remarked that, in the Seychelles, the paradise islands, tourists pay 300 dollars a night and more for a hotel room, while the local people have to slave for the local potentate and his court of cronies for a few dollars a day."
"The Communist dictatorship of Cuba also springs to mind; this report makes cautious reference to it, but it is a place where opponents disappear behind bars for months and years without any form of trial, while the regime of an old and senile man guilty of crimes against humanity feeds on the currency of debauched western Europeans."
"These too are sad side effects of tourism that deserve our attention."
"Mr President, tourism is a major source of income for many developing countries and it has a significant impact on the transformation of their economies."
"Clearly, aid in this area should be one of the priorities of the support provided by the European Union."
"At the same time, however, we need to be aware of certain threats to which tourists are exposed and of threats related to the flow of tourists affecting the 25 Member States of the Union."
"Issues concerning the way in which the tourist sector might support totalitarian regimes must feature prominently in any debate on tourism and development."
"I note with concern that there is no reference to the drugs trade in the text."
"Nonetheless, it is the case that pleasure-seeking travellers to developing countries frequently resort to drugs."
"This leads to a boom in trade in all types of drugs on the territory of the country concerned."
"It is important not to overlook the threats posed to tourists by terrorists, whose activities are often directed against the former."
"Events in Egypt, where Islamic terrorists tend to target tourists, are a case in point."
"Potential epidemics represent another negative influence on the development of tourism, because travellers are deterred from visiting the country in question."
"We should therefore assure financial support to children’s immunisation programmes providing antigens to diphtheria, tetanus and other infectious diseases."
"A new disease representing a direct threat to European countries has recently emerged."
"I refer to avian influenza, which is also acting as a strong deterrent against travel to areas affected by this disease."
"Failure to react to this threat will be to nobody’s advantage."
"Sex tourism must not be overlooked either."
"It claims numerous child victims, and a determined and unequivocal attack on this practice and all the types of criminality associated with it is needed. I therefore propose providing logistical support to countries facing problems of this kind."
"Victims of sex tourism need to be rehabilitated, but it is important not to deal only with the consequences, but also to ensure tourists are fully aware of the treatment that will be meted out to them if they commit offences of this kind. Offenders must be dealt with with the utmost severity."
"Tourism serves as a source of income to totalitarian regimes."
"This is an important issue, but it is rarely mentioned."
"For the governments of several Member States of the European Union, the issue of maintaining diplomatic relations with the Cuban regime is a sensitive one, because it is so often linked to the tourist sector."
"On the one hand we realise how much such a poor country can be helped by supporting the tourist sector, but on the other we are aware that all the proceeds end up in the hands of a small exclusive group closely linked to Fidel Castro’s regime."
"I regret the lack of a clear and convincing approach to such situations in the document under discussion."
"Mr President, my thanks and congratulations go to the rapporteur."
"It is very important that we acknowledge that tourism is a major industry in many developing countries."
"Many developing countries such as poorer countries, and LDCs such as Mozambique and others, see it as a sector which needs to be developed further."
"Therefore, it is appropriate to ask the Commission to look at ways that we can do that, certainly with ACP countries, under the provisions already existing in the Cotonu agreement."
"For some developing countries, tourism accounts for something like 50% of GDP, so we should be aware of that."
"We can be positive; it leads to the development of infrastructure, it can help to reduce the isolation of rural communities and it offers new opportunities for vegetable growers and others in developing countries."
"However, there are downsides, which all of us here would acknowledge."
"We need to have a proper regulatory framework that ensures that there are no corrupt practices and that there is no property speculation or environmental damage, and it should not be beyond the wit of us as donors to ensure that host countries do not suffer in any way from the development of tourism."
"What I see and hear from the Commission is that there does not seem to be very much understanding of how we can actually integrate tourism into the broader development strategies we have; that ought to be positive and something that can be thought about."
"There need to be well publicised penalties, as my colleague has said, for people who are involved in sex tourism because so many people, especially children, are drawn into prostitution and drugs."
"The European Union has a role to play here, and we have a role in pressing the industry – nobody here has spoken about the responsibility of the tourist industries in our own countries to ensure that their practices do not damage the countries where they are."
"We need to be sure that we are pressing the need for workers' rights – on low wages, on long hours and on the lack of secure contracts."
"This is the kind of thing that could be monitored through our ACP relationship with 78 countries."
"Mr President, I echo the comments of my group colleague, Mr Kusstatscher, concerning the many positive aspects of this report, which does a decent job of highlighting the paradox that exists in the developing world when it comes to tourism."
"In developing this issue, however, the Commission should bear in mind the principles of yesterday's sustainable tourism debate."
"The sustainable tourism report was excellent."
"I would hope that the Commission would view that debate and this one as two sides of the same coin, when looking to come up with a strategy in this area."
"I quite agree with the rapporteur that tourism can be a powerful force for good in countries in the developing world."
"However, I remember well, when I was working in India for six months, how very often the impact of tourism on local communities was negative."
"I suggest that one of the most useful things that we and the Commission can do to take this forward is to focus on sustainability and perhaps even the production of a code of best practice that companies can aspire to."
"We can be positive in this field."
"I look forward to seeing how the Commission will take it forward."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party."
"As the Cornillet report has rightly shown, tourism has provided developing countries with an important opportunity for sustainable growth."
"They must, however, make use of this resource with respect for the local peoples’ cultures, individualities, socioeconomic situations and traditions."
"I want to mention two serious kinds of illegal activities that unfortunately often go hand in hand with tourism in those areas."
"First of all there is sex tourism, considered the third largest form of illegal trade in the world, which often involves minors and is a shameful but expanding business."
"Another kind of illegal activity is property speculation, which has involved – and generally spoilt – areas of environmental value and cultural heritage, with the tacit agreement and often even the approval of run-down local authorities."
"A strong, vigorous initiative is needed from the Community institutions as soon as possible, focusing particularly on funding and legislation to combat these two illicit practices, which are carried on above all by Europeans."
"Mr President, I will keep my speech to two minutes."
"Tourism today is an undisputed promoter of development, and it is also a key part of our development policy."
"It boosts employment, standards of living, health, and the infrastructure of many developing countries."
"I wish to raise three points."
"The first is that we need cross-border cooperation between the EU and the developing countries, between the countries of Africa and the developing countries, and cooperation too within the countries themselves."
"This requires cooperation between the public and the private sector."
"The second point is that, in my opinion, we need rules based on sustainable development."
"We have to pay attention, as many have already done in their speeches earlier on, to the matter of combating and weeding out child sex tourism."
"I think we would do well to earmark financial assistance for this."
"It is very much a matter of enlightening people’s attitudes both in the West and elsewhere."
"My third and last point is that we should invest in loans of cerebral capital, by which I mean people are sent from Europe to the developing countries to help promote economic growth, although in such a way that always takes account of the country’s own standpoint, the country’s special features, and the country’s culture."
"I spoke for two minutes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, previous speakers have already pointed out that tourism is both the world’s foremost economic activity and a sector that is developing very dynamically, both in developed and naturally also in developing countries."
"In economic terms, tourism is of crucial importance for a variety of industries."
"It lends impetus to the construction of infrastructure such as hotels, restaurants, airports and roads, as well as acting as a driving force behind improvements to educational systems, the growth of the construction and banking sectors and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"There can therefore be no question that the economic significance of tourism should be viewed in a positive light."
"Moving on to the political significance of tourism, a number of Members have already drawn attention to the fact that tourism can in many instances promote respect for human rights, civil liberties and democracy, as well as increasing political stability."
"I would furthermore point out that, at best, tourism can also encourage the mutual recognition of cultures, which is of enormous importance in this era of globalisation and diverse global risks."
"At the same time, however, it is quite clear that tourism also poses certain risks."
"As far as the economy is concerned, these risks relate to over-dependence on tourism, which is a problem that previous speakers have already mentioned."
"Reference has also been made to environmental risks, for example the threat posed to sources of drinking and industrial water, which in many countries have been exhausted."
"A further unresolved problem relates to the treatment of waste, by which I mean both solid and liquid waste."
"It goes without saying that tourism also poses risks to society, for example the eradication of local cultures, prostitution and child prostitution, as mentioned by previous speakers, and, in a number of countries, the rise of various forms of intolerance, such as religious intolerance, various forms of xenophobia, racism and frequently also extremism."
"I for my part am delighted that this report has been tabled, since it emphasises the opportunities offered by tourism, at the same time as highlighting the many risks it poses."
"Despite my reservations, I will vote in favour of it, although I too do not believe that a directorate-general should be set up for tourism."
"Mr President, tourism in any region should be a positive contributor to economic growth and stability."
"Obviously, tourism and terrorism do not mix and as an area meant to be emerging for good from the dark shadow of terrorism, we in Northern Ireland are beginning, I am glad to say, to see a steady gain from increased tourism."
"I greatly welcome that, but one has to recognise that, without real governmental commitment, the full potential can never be achieved."
"Tourism must plan well."
"It must build on opportunities."
"The Olympic Games coming to London in 2012 is such an opportunity for my region."
"I call not just for the Games but for the tourism spin-off to be managed and organised in such a way that every region of the UK will benefit."
"2012 also presents particular opportunities for Belfast as it is the centenary of the Titanic – I might add that we had a ‘titanic’ victory last night on the football field over England!"
"A world-class Titanic exhibition centre is planned for the very site where that famous ship was built."
"I trust neither national government nor Commission will be found wanting in financially contributing to the great success that venture can be."
"Mr President, that tourism can have many side-effects is not a matter of dispute."
"Being from the Tyrol myself, I know what I am talking about, for the Tyrol is now one of the world regions most visited by tourists."
"Tourism is the fastest-growing area of the economy and is already providing millions of people with jobs."
"Although it has the potential to stabilise incomes and economic conditions in developing countries, it is important that we create the legal framework that is needed if they are to be rid of the perils and risks that follow in tourism’s wake."
"What is most important is that we should put the development of tourism in each tourist destination on foundations that will be secure in the long term."
"As is stated in paragraph 35 of the motion for a resolution, which makes reference to the WTO’s code of ethics, we have to protect our hosts, and that means that tourists must treat their hosts as such, with respect, rather than behaving in such a way as to wreck structures that have evolved over time."
"Such aberrations as sex tourism deserve the most forthright condemnation, and, above all else, punishment at the hands of the law."
"We should maintain the European programmes that support financially the fight against these pernicious activities."
"Secondly, we have to protect nature in the places abroad that tourists visit, and not just by preventing the speculation in property to which paragraph 40 of the report refers."
"It is by our own habits of life that we destroy the natural resources of these countries."
"Let us bear in mind that we use far more water and energy than they do, and our lifestyles are of course exported by the way we act when we are there."
"There is also a dramatic increase in the amount of waste, which can result in the destruction of natural areas and to over-exploitation."
"This is where we have to start from the very outset with concepts of what sustainable tourism is and build on them."
"It is only if these conditions are in place that the beneficial effects of foreign travel can be felt to the full, by creating jobs and bringing prosperity, fostering economic development and, above all, stimulating population growth and the life of society."
"It can promote understanding between peoples, something that we need in a world that is, alas, becoming less and less secure."
"In any case, the report gets a warm welcome from me."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have to agree on the importance of tourism as an economic factor and a factor for sustainable development."
"I have some doubts, however, about the Cornillet report, in which a number of redundant and naïve statements stand out."
"In recital S, for instance, the emphasis given by ‘and its defenders’ seems, quite frankly, worth changing; and in recital AG there are some rather meaningless points: it proposes that sex tourism should be combated by the authorities, in coordination with NGOs, and also the proposal of promoting tourism initiatives controlled by the Union seems impracticable."
"Lastly, for the sake of propriety, in paragraph 30 one cannot ‘welcome’ the new legal basis concerning tourism established in the European Constitution, since the Constitution is now worthless, dead and buried by the outcome of the referenda and also, for example, by the Blair Government’s fear of holding any more polls in the near future."
"Finally, development and tourism do not require increased spending."
"I am against strengthening the existing services or creating new ones in the directorates-general of the European Commission, as proposed by the rapporteur."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been very interested to hear the opinions and comments expressed in relation to this report."
"I will say first of all that, in general terms, I agree with the fundamental elements of the report, except perhaps for certain points raised during the debates, which I can agree with."
"Tourism may be a significant driving force for the development of a poor country."
"Having said that, however, we must also consider the social effects, the environmental effects and, I would even say, the effects on cultural heritage."
"In fact, even here in Europe, large numbers of visitors to certain places lead to wear and tear and measures have to be taken to deal with it."
"I therefore believe that we must always bear in mind the need to protect countries’ cultural heritage."
"To the effects that I have already mentioned, I would also add the speculative effects and the economic effects."
"Having said that, I believe that we must respect a fundamental principle, and that is that it falls first and foremost to the partner States to decide whether to treat tourism as a priority economic sector."
"It is not our job to decide for them."
"On this basis, what seems to me to be important at Commission level – and I shall offer a very firm commitment in this regard, Mrs Kinnock – is that, as well as contributing to the creation of tourist infrastructures by means of development projects, it could provide governments with useful know-how in terms of assessing the positive and negative effects of investments in the tourism sector and the use of the various instruments available in order to prevent the least desirable consequences."
"I believe that there is a lot of study to be done in this regard but I agree with you, Mrs Kinnock, that, for our part, we have not given this issue sufficient consideration."
"I therefore promise that we will work on this issue because I believe that we can provide the countries in question with the necessary know-how to ensure that investments in tourism conform to a whole series of criteria relating to best practices."
"In this connection, I would like to digress slightly."
"I am currently working on an idea which would be a kind of ethical label intended for private companies that receive and manage the funds that the Commission grants them within the framework of cooperation."
"I shall soon have the opportunity to hold an exchange of views and to consult Parliament on this issue."
"We will be able to create a link between that label and the reflection that I was talking about."
"Finally, I shall say a word about sex tourism."
"It is proposed to restore the budget line dedicated to the fight against sex tourism in order to guarantee the effective allocation of resources for that action."
"The reform of budget lines proposed by the Commission within the framework of the financial perspectives 2007-2013 is aimed at establishing a more efficient and rational framework for the creation and management of these lines, to put an end to the pointless fragmentation and to improve the establishment of priorities within the lines."
"The European Parliament and civil society will be fully consulted with regard to the implementation of this reform."
"That is a promise."
"Such an important issue as combating sex tourism will certainly find its rightful place within the context of 'Human and social development', together with other issues such as the fight against AIDS, gender equality, training problems or social cohesion."
"Be that as it may, you may rest assured that we shall apply every possible attention and determination to trying to put in place an arsenal of support instruments aimed at developing countries that want to invest in tourism."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0215/2005) by Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on major and neglected diseases in developing countries [2005/2047(INI)]."
". Mr President, my reports always start with a quotation."
"On this occasion it is: If that is difficult for the interpreters, that is the oldest language – or one of them – of Europe."
"It is Ovid, and it translates as 'Stop it at the start; it is late for medicine to be prepared when disease has grown strong through long delays'."
"That is my theme."
"In 2005, we have seen many health threats, and a new health threat on our agenda as Marburg has emerged in Angola with a mortality rate of over 90%."
"Europe responded swiftly, supporting providing not just the powerful antibiotics and the intravenous fluids, but water purification systems and disposable, protective gear."
"That is just one example of the need for vigilance, prevention and rapid response, just one reason why we must never 'cherry-pick' in our battle against disease."
"We must continue to tackle the big three of AIDS, TB and malaria, but just as many – or even more – people die, become chronically ill or live with disabilities caused by diseases that the world neglects."
"It is time to end that poverty of fatalism; it is time to bring neglected diseases in from the cold and to bring real hope to those who live with and, too often, die from these diseases."
"Ten per cent of the world's biomedical research funds are dedicated to addressing the problems that are responsible for 90% of the world's burden of disease; that is the imbalance."
"At the end of 2004, for all neglected diseases, we had just 18 R[amp]D projects in clinical development and a further 42 on the way."
"While, for other diseases, we had 2 100 projects in clinical development."
"Less than 1% of the 1 393 new drugs placed on the market between 1975 and 1999 were for infectious tropical diseases."
"Every year, 1.5 million children under five die from vaccine-preventable diseases."
"Patients suffering from sleeping sickness, leish-maniasis, dengue, trachoma and many others are given, too often, archaic drugs, some highly toxic, some ineffective."
"Some diseases are neglected because they are rare in western countries, so no market has emerged to develop such drugs."
"Some are neglected because western drugs are not made available or affordable."
"In my case, I live with diabetes."
"I have access to western medicine, treatment and care."
"When we were in Mali for the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I went to visit the local diabetes support clinics."
"There were two – only in Bamako – and they could not afford the drugs or the insulin, so the result was amputations and blindness, liver disease and early deaths."
"My call is for more research for neglected diseases and more support for care projects in developing countries."
"Clinical research is slow and patchy."
"There is plenty of basic research and knowledge about parasites and genomes, but there needs to be more bridging research to translate basic research into tested and safe drugs and clinical applications."
"I support very much the DNDi call for more research in this area, and I hope colleagues will sign up to its campaign."
"The call is also for more help – both available and affordable – for diseases which affect the developed world, like diabetes, epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia."
"Fifty-two million people are afflicted with epilepsy in our world; 80% of them are not treated; 70% could live seizure-free lives with comparatively cheap five-euros-a-day anti-epileptic drugs."
"The story goes on."
"I very much welcome what the Commission has brought forward on HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB."
"Its communication and then the programme for action are very welcome."
"We know that there were more new infections with AIDS in 2004 than in any previous year."
"We know that anti-retroviral prices are an increasingly serious public health hazard – that is a statement by the WHO."
"We know that malaria is giving real opportunity with the new drugs made from the plant , and we need to accelerate the production and distribution of that as well as of insecticide-protected nets."
"With TB we need to recognise the link to AIDS – the multi-drug resistance versions which kill two million a year."
"I urge the Commission to carry on its good work on TB, AIDS and malaria and to renew its efforts in the neglected diseases, because they are also killing and debilitating people across the developing world."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his report."
"He has identified some of the essential points on which the Commission will focus its action over the coming years with the assistance of Parliament and the Member States."
"The European Commission supports the improvement of results in the field of health by means of projects, sectoral budgetary support and general budgetary support relating to results in the field of health."
"The Commission will also continue to support research and development with a view to preventing, treating and curing diseases, including the so-called neglected diseases."
"The action programme to speed up the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in external actions, proposes supplementary actions for combating these three major diseases of poverty."
"The programme proposes a series of coherent and concrete actions that are often jointly managed by the European Commission and the Member States, to be undertaken both in the partner countries and at world level, with a view to strengthening the fight against these diseases and to contribute to achieving the Millennium development objectives."
"Our actions must contribute to increasing the credibility of the policy of prevention, of access for treatment and of investments in the development of new vaccines and other tools and interventions for prevention or treatment."
"Within this context, Europe will enhance its political dialogue with its partners, with a view to helping them to confront the enormous challenges facing them by means of ambitious strategies and active participation by civil society and the private sector."
"Europe will contribute to strengthening the capacities of these countries in key fields, in particular regulation in the field of the evaluation and licensing of pharmaceutical products, as well as research."
"I would also like to inform you of other initiatives that I have already taken and which are closely linked to the action programme."
"The first initiative relates to the human resources crisis in the health sector in the developing countries."
"As you know, this problem is critical in the countries that are trying to enhance their actions within the framework of the fight against the three diseases."
"I shall therefore present the College with a communication indicating the means for strengthening this fight, in cooperation with the Member States of the European Union and the African Union."
"I am also going to launch a new initiative aimed at guaranteeing the availability of new medicines."
"This requires additional support from the World Health Organisation."
"It will also require new measures at European level, with a view to encouraging – as you have said very well – the private sector to invest in research and development of new medicines more specifically geared towards the curing of diseases suffered by certain countries that are clearly currently of little economic interest to the sector."
"I have tried to give you a clearer idea of how the Commission intends to implement the action programme, through cooperation with the Member States of the European Union, the programming of resources and the launching of specific initiatives."
"I very much hope to hold a dialogue with you on these issues."
". Mr President, I have always dreamed of being the last speaker before the vote: that is a guarantee for having a lot of people in attendance, although no one really listens."
"I wish to make three very brief points."
"The first is that my Group and I support Mr Bowis' report, which is excellent."
"Development policy is often seen as some kind of post-colonial deal that eases our conscience."
"This time it is not: it is about people and preventing epidemic diseases spreading around the world."
"These are issues that touch all of us and my Group therefore supports it."
"My second observation is that this field needs more research."
"We know very little about epidemic diseases and how they spread."
"Extensive work is being done, but more money needs to be invested and the Commission, and indeed the European Union, could be the right source."
"My final point is that we need more money."
"It is absolutely clear, as also pointed out in Mr Bowis' report, that funding is the main priority."
"For example, between the years 1975 and 1999, less than 1% of new medicines was for the treatment of tropical and epidemic diseases."
"We really need to do some work."
"What we basically need is more money and research, but my Group fully supports the report on the table."
"– The next item is voting time."
"– I should like to propose an amendment, whereby the phrase ‘and creating a joint border civil protection corps’ in paragraph 9 of the Resolution be replaced with the phrase ‘and creating a European civil protection corps taking special account of the vulnerabilities of border zones’."
"I should also like to point out that there is a small mistake in paragraph 17 of the Portuguese translation."
"The English version of paragraph 17 should therefore be taken as authentic."
". Mr President, I have an oral amendment."
"It is true that the wording of paragraph Q is a little abrupt when it says, ‘tourism is the enemy of totalitarianism and dictatorships’."
"I would therefore like to tone it down so that my fellow Members can accept the amendment, changing it to: ‘the development of tourism may be a means for combating totalitarianism and dictatorships’."
"– That concludes voting time."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate and thank all the Members who have been involved in the drawing up of this resolution."
"This is unfortunately not the first and probably will not be the last."
"I hope, however, that it will be followed up."
"I personally have voted for it because it contains a paragraph 12 which addresses the Commission and asks it to take full account of the need to fund measures for preventing forest fires."
"In 1992, there was a regulation."
"This regulation was abolished in 2003 in favour of Forest Focus, which is currently provided with EUR 61 million for ecological protection programmes and only EUR 9 million for the fight against fires."
"I myself come from a forest region and I must tell you that the foresters regret this situation, since the funding is necessary for the creation of firebreaks, equipment and monitoring and control systems which are very effective in terms of preventing forest fires."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will take full account of this resolution and that it will give back the prevention of forest fires and the creation of preventive systems the place they deserve within our budget."
"Otherwise we will unfortunately be obliged to admit that our compassion is often short-lived."
"I consider the joint draft resolution on natural disasters to be an extremely important signal for the European citizens, and I voted to support it."
"Its importance is underlined by the fact that climatic extremes are no longer chance events, but a well-defined weather trend."
"The influence of global warming on daily weather is obvious."
"Achieving the Kyoto targets has become a great challenge for the whole world."
"If we do not sharply reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, scientists believe that Europe is yet to feel the force of the weather in the next half century."
"The time has come to devise a clear strategy and take measures including financial instruments that will allow us to prevent, avert or at least postpone natural disasters."
"The long time it took to release the aid for the Slovak Tatra mountains has shown us that remedying the consequences of natural disasters in the future will require full commitment on the part of Europe, and immediate financial aid from the solidarity fund when a Member State requests it."
"We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the resolution on natural disasters because we are able to support the overall thrust of the resolution."
"We share the view that disasters are largely due to climate change, bringing about extreme weather conditions."
"If climate change is to be reversed, the global work on the Kyoto protocol must be continued and stepped up."
"We also believe that the EU Member States can join in helping one another cope successfully with the emergencies that arise in the wake of natural disasters."
"We think, however, that some of the proposals in the resolution are too detailed and far-reaching."
"We are dubious about agricultural aid being used for setting up fire-breaks, and we do not want to see an EU-funded system of agricultural insurance."
"We welcome international solidarity when countries are hit by natural disasters or other events with devastating consequences."
"We do not, however, believe that the EU should use events of this kind to strengthen its influence over different policy areas."
"The Commission should not carry out detailed analyses of the causes of forest fires."
"The EU should not develop a common policy for preventing forest fires."
"No EU bodies should be set up with responsibility for monitoring a variety of climate factors."
"It is a pity that the European Parliament should try to take every opportunity to promote the positions adopted by the EU."
". We welcome the adoption of this resolution, to which we made a substantial contribution."
"We wish to highlight the adoption of the following proposals, which we tabled again in plenary:"
"- insists on the need to apply the EU Solidarity Fund immediately to areas and countries affected;"
"- urges the Commission to expedite all the relevant Community administrative procedures, namely those relating to the need to reprogramme the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and to make the overly-rigid processing of these funds more flexible;"
"- emphasises the need for Community support for the replanting of forests in the affected areas;"
"We trust that they will come to fruition."
"We also regret that our proposals were rejected, which were as follows:"
"- a public farming insurance scheme, funded by the EU, should be set up in order to guarantee farmers a minimum income in situations of public calamity, such as droughts, fires and floods;"
"- urges the Council to take into account, in its proposal for the forthcoming financial perspective for 2007-2013, the need to create mechanisms in support of the affected population with a view to the prevention of further large-scale disasters resulting from climate change, aimed at trying to minimise their consequences."
". The widespread fires and floods experienced this summer in Europe further emphasise the need to take seriously a global strategy on climate change."
"It is appropriate to ensure that the Solidarity Fund rules clearly allow for aid to populations directly affected by natural disasters, and that funds can be released quickly on receipt of Member State requests."
". It is a good thing that the European Parliament has at last realised the need for something to be done about natural disasters."
"As a matter of urgency, and not least in view of the large-scale fires in southern Europe and the major flooding in central Europe, the EU needs to develop its existing public-sector capacities."
"The wholesale failure of the US Administration in the face of the disastrous floods in New Orleans is another reason why it is time to put a stop to the neoliberal compulsion to cut costs and break up institutions one by one that save lives."
"We must prevent the merger of civilian and military structures advocated by such spokespersons on EU military policy as Javier Solana, the EU’s representative for foreign and security policy, and the Green MEP Angelika Beer, for this would result not only in the militarisation of civilian structures, but would also expose civilian aid workers to the very considerable risk of being regarded as part of the armed forces and thus – as has happened in Afghanistan – as another party to the conflict."
"In order to make more funding available for disaster aid, such EU projects as the Galileo satellite guidance system, which is also capable of being – and is intended to be – used for military purposes, should be stopped."
"Not only does Galileo subsidise the aerospace and armaments firm EADS, but the system is also being introduced too late in the day to be a success."
"Galileo is also intended to play a crucial role in future European security and defence policy, which is to be oriented towards armed intervention."
"The disaster that has once again struck Portugal, which has reduced hundreds of thousands hectares to ashes, left families homeless, destroyed areas of countryside and worst of all taken a number of lives, deserves our concern and our commitment to finding solutions to keep its effects, where possible, to a minimum. A serious, concerted effort is also required to ensure that this does not happen again."
"It is clear that climate change, and the extreme heat that is has brought, is the direct, immediate cause of the scale of the disaster."
"Human neglect, however, is a further factor that should not be discounted."
"I personally believe that the commitment shown by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the initiative of the MEPs from the People’s Party in Portugal (CDS-PP), will ultimately make a major contribution towards raising awareness among the Community institutions and towards providing resources."
"This resolution, which also refers to disasters in other Member States deserving of our solidarity for similar reasons, will help the decision-making process and the implementation of the measures required."
"Of these measures, I should like to highlight the urgent need to reinstate aid for creating firebreaks and the call for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund."
"With regard to these two aspects, incidentally, I have no choice but to conclude that the Portuguese Government has been dreadfully negligent."
". As a Member of the European Parliament for an area of France, the Massif central, which relies very heavily on the development of tourism, I am happy to have supported the report by Luis Queiro and I too would like to congratulate him on his excellent work."
"This vote has been eagerly awaited by tourism professionals."
"In fact, tourism is one of the European Union’s sectors that is experiencing the greatest progress."
"It involves more than 2 million companies, the majority of which are SMEs."
"I am very satisfied with the amendments calling for the simplification of the special VAT system in relation to the profit margin of travel agents and tour-operators, as well as the preservation of the competitive position of operators established in the European Union compared to third-country operators."
"I also hope that the Council will take a decision on reduced VAT rates without any further delay, thereby allowing Member States to apply reduced rates for restaurants, as already exist for other activities relating to tourism."
"Restaurateurs have been given many promises and they are now expecting concrete results from us."
"Let us not disappoint them!"
"Finally, it is essential that the European Council and the European Commission should take a global approach in favour of tourism ..."
"Tourism is a very important industry for most EU countries, but it does not belong to the area of Community policy."
"Yet this report calls on the Commission to adopt a series of measures in the sphere of tourism."
"The report also proposes that a special post be set up in the EU budget for tourism-related measures."
"We believe that tourism is an example of something that the Member States should deal with themselves and not an area in which the EU should interfere."
"We have therefore voted against the report."
"The Moderates have voted against the report on tourism and accordingly emphasise that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, tourism is the Member States’ area of competence."
"Because this is not a Community area, the report’s tendency to view it as such, together with the various steps it proposes, are also things to which we are opposed. For example, we see no reason for the Commission to prepare a tourist package comprising a survey of current directives on consumer rights within tourism."
"Such measures should be developed in the Member States with the parties concerned."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Queiró, which, broadly speaking, was worthy of my support and that of my group."
"Coming from Madeira as I do, a region in which tourism is one of the main factors in its sustainable growth, it stands to reason that I support the report, and I do primarily for the following reasons: firstly, because of the importance of tourism, at European, national and regional level, and its contribution towards economic growth, job creation and technological innovation, which in turn represents a contribution towards fulfilling the aims of the Lisbon Strategy; secondly, the development potential that it offers regions with economic difficulties and specific geographical characteristics, such as the outermost regions; thirdly, the contribution made by EU and Community measures – supporting, coordinating and complementing the actions of Member States – towards the development of the tourism sector; fourthly, still in this context, the EU’s incentive to set up the most effective structures and provide the appropriate financial resources; fifthly, the role of tourism in environmental protection, in regional planning and in preserving and revitalising cultural values, traditions, customs and natural and artistic heritage; and lastly, security concerns and the protection of the rights of the tourist as consumer."
"We are voting against this report."
"This is not an issue with which the EU should concern itself. Paragraph E of the report states that tourism does not at present constitute an area of Community policy but, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, comes within the remit of the Member States."
"That is an absolutely correct assessment."
"In spite of that, the report contains a host of proposals for a tourism policy at EU level."
"- tourist services would be classified at EU level"
"- a special training network for tourism-related skills would be set up"
"- bodies representing tourists in their capacity as consumers would be established"
"- a contact group would be set up with the participation of the Member States and the tourist operators"
"- a network would be established to enable organisations concerned with high-risk sports and leisure activities to exchange good practice."
"We are opposed to all such proposals."
"In spite of the fact that the draft Constitution for the EU has been rejected, it is referred to as the basis for tourism being an EU issue."
"It is proposed that a special tourism line should be established in the EU budget."
"The June summit clearly showed that the Member States do not wish to pay for all sorts of new policy areas."
"The report’s justification, namely that tourism contributes to growth and employment and is therefore central to the Lisbon process, can be applied to just about every area."
"We believe that the principle of subsidiarity takes precedence over such ways of thinking."
". We welcome the adoption of our proposal, which:"
"- ‘points out that preserving the cultural heritage (in particular that which is designated world heritage by UNESCO), is of major importance to the sustainable development of tourism in the EU’, and calls ‘upon the Commission to make more money available for preserving the cultural heritage’."
"That being said, we regret the rejection, among others, of the following proposals that we tabled, which expressed:"
"- ‘concern at the amount of precarious work in the tourism sector, as a result of contractual arrangements, wage levels, working conditions and seasonal factors’, and stated that ‘in order to improve the quality of the services provided and to promote greater social cohesion, investment must be made in creating high-quality jobs and in helping the workers in the sector to obtain qualifications (vocational training, improved working conditions, promotion of stable contractual arrangements)’;"
"- and stated ‘that the tourism sector makes a major contribution towards economic development, towards employment at regional level and towards territorial cohesion’ and that it is necessary ‘to support the development of this sector, both on a broad scale, through various Community policies and funds, and specifically, via the creation of a dedicated Community programme aimed at promoting the sector and the synergies between the various economic and social agents involved’."
". I agree with the broad lines of this report."
"Nevertheless, I would raise certain reservations in relation to the fact that its approach to the development of tourism is overly focussed on the protection of the environment and the consumer."
"The voice of the consumers and the defenders of the environment is already fully heard within the European institutions: the protection of consumers and of the environment are subject to specific headings in the Treaties and entire directorates-general within the Commission deal respectively with these two areas."
"Why, therefore, do we want to over-emphasise these fields?"
"I personally believe that any tourism policy should principally focus on the economic activity generated by the tourism industry and that a balanced approach to the different areas can only be achieved if the interests of providers of tourist services (hoteliers, restaurateurs, tour-operators, crafts of all kinds, private transport etc.) are fully defended."
"The rapporteur is right to state that tourism creates growth, but in order for this to be fully the case, we must allow our national economic actors to be competitive and prevent them from being hindered by regulations and taxation as they exist in particular in France."
"The Moderates have voted against the own-initiative report on gender discrimination in health systems."
"Like many other issues in connection with which there are different solutions and traditions in the different Member States, issues of gender equality and of health care and medical treatment should be dealt with at national level."
"The EU should only get involved in such issues in cases where the individual Member States cannot deal with them better themselves."
"The above-mentioned report addresses many important aspects of women’s health and access to health care."
"Unlike the rapporteur, Mrs Svensson, we believe that many of these aspects are best taken care of by individual Member States, individual hospitals or individual people."
"One way of developing and improving health care and medical treatment, without, for example, the EU interfering in national health strategies or the Commission being required to carry out investigations into certain tendencies within health care, is through best practice and the exchange of information between the Member States, hospitals, research institutes and other affected parties, this being a development we should sincerely welcome."
". I voted in favour of this initiative report, which highlights discrepancies between men and women in terms of prescription, treatments and costs."
"Although I oppose human cloning, I believe that there is merit in researching the potential for stem cell treatments for degenerative diseases."
". The fact that members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have rejected paragraph 10 of the Svensson report or abstained from voting has to do with differing interpretations of the UN Resolution to which it refers and to the unfortunate fact that it was not possible, in the course of preparatory deliberations, to deal with the differences between versions of the report in different languages."
"In my capacity as the PSE Group’s shadow rapporteur, and in order to prevent misunderstandings, I would therefore like to make this clarificatory statement:"
"It goes without saying that, if any person in my group rejects paragraph 10 or abstains from voting on it, it does not mean that he or she is in favour of human cloning."
"We unreservedly endorse UN Resolution A/59/516/Add 1 (‘Declaration on Human Cloning’), which states that practices contrary to human dignity, such as reproductive cloning, must not be permitted."
"As we do not want to tolerate such things under any circumstances, it is more specifically demanded in the German version that ‘human cloning shall be excluded from support and funding under European Union programmes’."
"This demand is made explicitly in the future tense, as the intention is that such practices should never be permissible in the EU and that it should of course never be possible to fund them surreptitiously."
"It is regrettable that versions in many languages – English, French and Swedish among them – give the impression that we are today allowing EU programmes to promote the cloning of humans."
"That is self-evidently not the case, and for that reason, we have not agreed to paragraph 10 of the report."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues are supportive of efforts to deal with gender discrimination in health systems across the EU."
"Poor access to healthcare and any form of exploitation of women are matters that should be addressed by Member States in public policy development."
"It is clearly desirable that Member States share information and best practice on how these problems should be addressed and sections of this report do provide some useful ideas."
"However, there a number of suggestions in this report with which we take issue and which have led to our decision on the final vote."
"Using structural funds for preventative medical purposes and demanding specific conditions on employment of medical personnel are issues that are rightly the preserve of Member States."
"The own-initiative report on gender discrimination in health systems addresses many very important issues affecting women’s health, especially the fact that it is male physiognomy that is the point of departure in modern medicine, in spite of the fact that there clearly are significant biological differences between the sexes."
"That is an unsatisfactory state of affairs to which my party, the Liberal People’s Party, has called attention on several occasions."
"Despite the report’s good intentions in terms of promoting women’s health within the EU, I am voting against the report."
"I choose to do so because I believe that, in too many respects, the report contravenes the principle of subsidiarity."
"A good many of the proposals presented infringe the sovereignty of the Member States and also encroach on the right of individuals to take their own decisions affecting their own lives."
"It is not for the European Parliament to decide whether women should be entitled to Caesarean sections or whether nursing staff should have shorter working periods and higher salaries."
"At the same time, the report is characterised in other areas by its unduly broad-brush approach to wordings."
"I am thinking here mainly of the sections on ovarian stimulation and on removing egg cells."
". I should like to congratulate Mrs Svensson on her important report on gender discrimination in health systems, to which I give my full backing."
"I particularly wish to highlight the need to ensure that both sexes can enjoy the benefits of treatment, but that they can also provide medical treatment and care on the basis of equal opportunities."
"I should also like to point out the need to invest in health research with patients’ gender taken into account. I therefore support the initiative to include research into the health situation of the sexes in the new health and consumer protection programme (2007-2013) and take it into account when planning the Seventh Framework Research Programme."
". As long ago as 1957, in the Treaties of Rome, the removal of inequalities between men and women was defined as an objective."
"A certain amount has been achieved since then, particularly as a result of women’s health programmes in the 1990s, but much still remains to be done."
"For example, the proportion of women working in healthcare may well generally be very high – it is over 78% in Austria – but it is small to the point of insignificance in senior management and other professions that enjoy high status and consequent high earnings."
"This runs counter to what has been called the ‘feminisation of ageing’, as men form the majority of the population up to about the age of 45 and women thereafter."
"This makes it essential that greater consideration be given to problems specific to women."
"The establishment by some Member States of universal screening programmes for the early detection of breast cancer in women between the ages of 50 and 69 was another advance, and there is no doubt about the importance of doing this as the report suggests and urging the others to take the same course of action."
"We should, however, be concerned about the fact that it is between the ages of 35 and 55 that breast cancer most frequently proves fatal, and so we must do more to promote awareness of the dangers among this age group and adapt the screening programmes accordingly."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues Conservatives are largely supportive of this report that suggests much needed reform to an outdated system where the EU gives €127 million to European Schools."
"However, it is essential that a budget ceiling is put in place for the EU's contributions; that Member States hosting the schools give a greater contribution towards the local costs; that there is a realistic contribution from parents of Category III children."
"We also urge the Commission to make an appropriate response to the Advisory Board's recommendations to deliver value for money and to protect the interests of the EU taxpayer."
"It is unacceptable that fees should have risen by 62.2% for 2005/2006 compared with 2002/2003."
"That is a scandalous rise, because it is prohibitive for most of the families involved and because it was decided while the 1994 agreement, which covered a 10-year period, was still in force."
"Because European Schools provide a public service, such unilateral decisions violating families’ established rights should not be allowed."
"Whatever compromises may be possible on budgetary matters, we feel we must stand fast on a number of points: 1) European Schools should exist in all Member States; 2) there should be as many language sections as possible, according to the principle of respecting cultural identity; 3) the maximum class size should be reduced from the current 32; 4) it would be worth making a few adjustments to the curricula: art history, for instance, is currently excluded, although it would encourage a greater understanding of the common cultural values that have inspired the peoples of Europe over the centuries; 5) a vocational baccalaureate should be added alongside the current arts- and science-based European baccalaureate: both courses would remain a specific, valid point of reference for providing young people with a European training."
"The European Schools system is taking on a life of its own with the debate as to whether ‘the European Schools system fosters the concept of European citizenship’ (to quote recital C of the report)."
"We can understand the need for European Schools designed to provide mother-tongue education to the children of EU officials."
"However, the system has come to look odd when, for example, only 1.6% of the pupils at the European School, Culham are children of staff at EU institutions and bodies."
"With EU enlargement, the number of official languages has become so large that the whole situation involving European Schools needs to be reviewed."
"With EU bodies being placed in decentralised locations, European Schools would now have to be founded in all the Member States."
"We believe that a more flexible solution needs to be found when it comes to the education of EU officials’ children."
"The EU institutions and bodies should, as employers, quite simply pay the school fees (up to a certain level) for their staff’s children."
"If the parents then choose to send their children to a state or local authority school or to a private independent one, they should sort the matter out locally."
"As a rule, there is the opportunity to choose between a local and an international school in those places where the EU institutions and bodies are situated."
"The system of European Schools appears to have had its day."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
". Since 1957, Europe has set up special schools intended to educate the children of the staff of the European Communities together while accepting a very limited number of external pupils."
"So what was the thinking behind this policy of exception, applying a principle of corporatist preference, a policy which furthermore is condemned in other fields by this same Europe?"
"Do as I say and not as I do!"
"This system of European schools therefore promotes the concept of European citizenship, which is, for Europe, what the concept of national preference should be for France and the other free nations of Europe."
"But the development of these schools is intended not to build the Europe of nations to which we aspire, but to promote European integration; a policy which has just been condemned by the French people on 29 May 2005."
"These schools are not only discriminatory against non-European civil servants, but against all of the children of Europe."
"They also create a system of outrageous privileges intended almost exclusively for civil servants of the European institutions in order to reproduce a single and obligatory European model: a federal Europe by integration."
". The European Schools exist to provide an education in their mother tongue for the children of officials of the European Institutions."
"Unlike some Members I welcome this."
"Children of EU officials deserve a quality education in their mother tongue and the existence of the schools helps the institutions in the recruitment and retention of suitable qualified personnel."
"The Rapporteur is right to focus on two issues which the schools have so far failed to address, firstly, access and provision for pupils with special needs which must be improved, secondly, the need to introduce a more vocational curriculum and set of qualifications."
". The European schools are obviously beneficial and valuable and should be viewed as a facility offered to Community employees."
"Like any institution, however, it is necessary from time to time to assess the quality and effectiveness of its operations and, reasonably and judiciously, to propose useful and effective reforms that will make a difference."
"As this is the main thrust of the report before us, I voted in favour."
"There is one aspect raised in the report, however, which I wish to make a point of emphasising, namely the issue of not communitarising the Member States’ functions and responsibilities."
"The motion is worthy of being supported by the European Parliament."
"The concept of multilingual and multinational education implemented in these schools could serve as a model for Member States’ educational systems."
"Nonetheless, the programme has its weaknesses."
"There are no standard rules for all such institutions concerning the admission of candidates, overly large classes, and pupils being obliged to attend lessons given in a language other than their mother tongue."
"There are no recommendations either concerning the education of children with special needs."
"Such shortcomings must be remedied."
"Following enlargement of the European Union, it is appropriate to consider the need to create similar schools on the territory of the new Member States."
"The establishment of the External Borders Agency in Warsaw should offer just such an opportunity, because education must be provided for the children of the officials employed there."
"Institutions of this type will play an important part in promoting the idea of European integration amongst future generations."
"As author of the report on tourism in Europe, I have followed Mr Cornillet’s work with interest. I feel that we both work on the basis of the same opinion that tourism is an industry with the potential to revitalise societies, and that this should not be neglected."
"Nevertheless, I believe that this report proposes measures that go beyond the Union’s remit and harm private initiative, which lies at the heart of this industry."
"The scope of the Cornillet report stretches even further – it cuts across our policies on development aid."
"In this respect, tourism can make a significant contribution towards democratisation and political balance in these societies, as it promotes job creation, helps to develop new technology and contributes towards vocational training."
"Yet it is through private initiatives that this process will develop and there is no doubt in my mind that we do not need regulatory or interventionist measures, which could prove counterproductive."
"I therefore abstained in the vote on the Cornillet report."
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on major and neglected diseases in developing countries."
". Mr President, I would like to wholeheartedly endorse the congratulations that greeted Mr Bowis’ report this morning."
"I am sure that will come as no surprise to him, for he has presented a very even-handed and forward-looking report on an important subject, and I hope that it will receive the backing of an overwhelming majority in this House."
"The subject of major and neglected diseases in developing countries has a considerable human rights dimension to it."
"The rights to health and to access to medication are primarily social issues, for it is above all the developing countries that are affected by the neglected diseases, and in them, as so often, the poorest of the poor."
"It is for that reason that I think it is a good thing that the Bowis Report explicitly puts these in the context of other political issues, such as, for example, the cancellation of the poorest countries’ debts."
"If these countries carry on spending 40% of their gross domestic product on servicing debts, then there will be no changes in the situation or in the health systems of the countries themselves, no matter how many resolutions we adopt in this House."
"I am very glad to see that Mr Bowis devotes a large part of his report to the problem of HIV/AIDS, and, as usual, takes a very progressive line on them."
"We must be tireless in making the point that the most important thing that can be done to combat HIV/AIDS is to prevent it, and the statement in the Bowis Report that 2004 saw new and extremely high levels of infection is an indication of a political situation of which this House has been critical for a long time, namely that there is too little funding and too little support to enable preventive measures to be properly implemented, and this criticism is primarily directed at the Bush administration in the United States."
"I believe that it is wrong to approach this dogmatically, as if it were only a matter of principle, without looking at the reality of the developing countries."
"I am grateful to Mr Bowis for enabling us in the European Parliament to join with the Commission in showing that the European Union is going down another road."
"In all the statements, whether from the non-governmental organisation ‘Médecins Sans Frontières’ or from the World Health Organisation, one point is underlined, and that is that we will not resolve the problem by relying on market forces; rather, we will get a grip on it only with massive public investment and a greater role for the public sector, not only in Europe but also in the developing countries that are affected."
"I believe that this point is all too seldom made, while we very often hear demands for less public intervention."
"If we are serious about wanting to resolve this problem, we need an affirmation to that effect, and I was very glad to hear the Commissioner speak today about how consideration is being given to concrete measures of support, which would also involve investment in fundamental research."
". Mr President, Mr Bowis has indeed written an excellent report that deserves our all-out support."
"I think that he is right to call for the extension of the Commission’s campaigns against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria to include other neglected diseases."
"People seem insufficiently aware that diseases like African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and dengue form a major threat to the health of very many people in the poorest countries."
"If medicines are available at all, they are either of very dubious quality or completely obsolete."
"Virtually no research and development is being done into these neglected diseases."
"The pharmaceutical industry is mainly interested if the sales are profitable and only invests if there are sufficient incentives."
"Possible policy measures that could boost investments include tax credits, innovation rewards, pre-qualification assistance and commitments to the purchase of patent rights."
"As rapporteur for the regulation that is intended to ensure the implementation of the WHO decision on intellectual property rights (TRIPs) and access to medicines, I hope that the Council and Parliament will reach agreement very quickly on a text that will make it possible for this important decision to be applied immediately in the 25 Member States."
"Moreover, while the Commission and Member States must actively support the implementation of the Doha Declaration and oppose any measure taken by the WHO member states that could undermine these commitments, African leaders should also accept their responsibility in the fight against the major and neglected diseases."
"It is important that they too should make health care a priority."
"In this connection, it is irresponsible for certain African governments to levy a tax on the sale or import of medicines, putting these out of the reach of the poor."
"The international community will, however, need to supplement the public and private investments at national level with long-term financial support."
"We in the European Parliament must continue to press consistently for 35% of development aid to be spent on health and education."
"Only in that way can we give renewed hope to tens of thousands of people who are still dying of diseases that could, and should, have been wiped out a long time ago."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Bowis for his very constructive work, above all because he goes beyond well-known diseases such as AIDS, malaria and TB and deals with sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease."
"These are forgotten diseases here in the West, but they make their presence all too sharply felt in the South, with millions of victims every year."
"The tsunami brought people’s suffering to light, and aid flooded in."
"If we can give these diseases a higher profile and mobilise the same resources, it will be possible to reduce the suffering of millions of people."
"Yesterday, we voted on the need for paediatric medicine, and Parliament unfortunately accorded additional patent extensions worth many billions of euros to the pharmaceutical companies as compensation, so we need in all fairness to be able to find the mere EUR 3 billion needed for devising treatments for these diseases that affect children and adults in the developing world."
"TB and AIDS exist here in the West, so treatments do too."
"These diseases mainly affect adults, however, and we do not have treatments suited to children."
"Public funds need to be invested in this area, for the children of the developing world have no way of financing their medical needs themselves."
"The money may, for example, come from a 1% tax on the profits of pharmaceutical companies that has to be paid when they have found cures."
"There are many other solutions."
"It is our shared responsibility to ensure that resources for combating these diseases are created immediately."
"How developed a civilisation is may be judged on the basis of how it deals with its most vulnerable members."
"The world’s most vulnerable group consists precisely of these poor and sick children."
"If we cannot even help them, humanitarianism has gone out of the window, and we should return to the caves."
". Mr President, I would like to make a few comments on the report on behalf of our colleague, Mr Maštálka, who, due to urgent duties in the Czech Republic, could not attend this part-session."
"First, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, on his report."
"It is a well-balanced, well-written and well-presented report."
"Secondly, we are talking about a problem that directly or indirectly affects three-quarters of the world's population, and its possible solutions."
"This means that immediate practical steps need to be taken and financial and other help provided."
"Third, these diseases require a complex approach."
"Cooperation is needed between international organisations, NGOs and the private sector, as well as dedicated individuals such as researchers and petitioners."
"For maximum effectiveness, there needs to be complete dedication, attention and support, both financially and in the form of know-how and experts from the industrialised countries, and close cooperation with developing nations, based on partnership."
"Fourth, the problem of neglected major diseases cannot only be associated with poor developing countries."
"Some of the European Union's neighbouring states are not considered developing countries and yet their epidemiological situations and possible solutions are similar in nature to those in the developing world."
"Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, as well as Russia, have serious problems with HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and other diseases."
"We should include them in our debate and when considering financial and other forms of aid."
"My fifth point is that, although we have discussed the threat of bioterrorism in our committees and at our part-sessions, I wonder whether we are prepared for the inevitable spread of some of the diseases mentioned in this report."
"There are often disaster scenarios that link the spread of some tropical diseases and their mutations to global warming."
"There are even warnings that some diseases such as malaria might affect our continent."
"Do we want to wait until our lives are directly affected before we act?"
"People in the developing world are human beings too and it is our duty to help protect them."
"We should not narrow down the issues presented in this report to the accessibility of drugs and cures for diseases, but should also take into account the situation of those less fortunate than ourselves."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, although poverty-related diseases claim many victims, it is still the case that not enough attention is being given to HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and various other diseases."
"In some cases, there are insufficient safe and effective medicines available and if they are, their price often renders them unaffordable to the sick."
"The Bowis report underlines that as a result of this, it is virtually only poor people who are affected because there are no profitable markets for the medicines."
"Moreover, as we have seen in the cases of tuberculosis and malaria, renewed outbreaks of the diseases can be traced back to the lack of sufficient investment in research and development."
"If this is to change, there must be joint efforts at international level."
"This illustrates the importance of the dynamic approach for which the Bowis report presses."
"Although some diseases are not given enough attention in the developing countries themselves, it would be useful if there were initiatives in Europe that could support the control of them."
"The example that springs to mind is leprosy."
"Should the report not have devoted more attention to this disease?"
"Has the Commission already launched various initiatives in order to combat leprosy?"
"One of the points made in the Bowis report is that we should ensure that the EU’s approach, in cooperation with the Member States, is realistic and readily understood."
"If, however, we argue in favour of obligations on the part of governments and industry that are imposed by the international community, there is relatively little hope of concrete improvements on the ground."
"Health is not enforceable but is a result of improving care that is supported locally by the people."
"Finally, it is important to have an understanding of the issue as a whole."
"Despite a strong link between disease and poverty, it is unwise to mistake the control of specific diseases for the objective of poverty reduction in general."
"Understanding is of crucial importance for parliamentary control in terms of the nature of the policy measures and their efficacy."
"I would like to thank Mr Bowis once again for his stimulating report."
"– I would like to thank Mr Bowis for his important report, to which I also proposed several changes and amendments, most of them accepted by the committee."
"I would like to also thank Mr Bowis for accepting these remarks."
"I agree with him that aid to developing countries and resolving this problem is a complex issue, but if such aid is to be effective, it needs to be comprehensive and target-oriented."
"This means not only the need for meticulous statistical calculations of the types of disease and their morbidity, together with their expected rates of spread, but also proposed solutions as set out in his report."
"The diseases at issue are those which, if ignored at the outset as it was the case, for instance, with HIV infections, may spread throughout the world."
"The fact that we have taken the lesson was evident in the rapid and effective reaction to SARS and bird flu."
"We in Europe cannot afford to sleep quietly, reassured by the fact that we have resolved the problem of tuberculosis thanks to the availability of drugs and diagnostic capabilities that allow us to effectively prevent the disease, when we know that countless children in Africa are dying of the disease every day."
"When I spoke of comprehensive aid, I also had in mind the supply of drinking water in developing countries, since its shortage directly contributes to the emergence and spread of certain diseases."
"I also had in mind educational programmes for children and young people concerning, for example, the issue of reproductive health, sex education and hygiene."
"Within the framework of this aid it is also important to provide guarantees, including financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies that stopped manufacturing certain drugs for tackling diseases of poor people, since there was no one to pay for them."
"Last but not least, it is necessary to ensure better conditions, in particular safety, for health workers who provide assistance in these regions."
"Mr President, I fully endorse this excellent report by the rapporteur Mr Bowis, but I feel that little justice can be done to the topic of major neglected diseases in developing countries in just two minutes."
"1.8 million people died in 2002 from tuberculosis alone; 2.2 billion are at risk of malaria, which is preventable and curable provided that sufficient ACT or the new combination therapy is made available; 39.4 million people are living with the HIV virus, and last year alone 3.1 million died from AIDS, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa."
"Only 700 000 of the 6 million who needed antiretrovirals could access that treatment."
"The huge human, social and economic fall-out from this is incalculable."
"60 million people, again in sub-Saharan Africa, are at risk from sleeping sickness via the tsetse fly."
"2 500 million people – two-fifths of the world's population – are at risk from dengue, another mosquito-borne infection, which is now endemic in 100 countries, with no specific treatment or even a vaccine yet."
"There is no specific treatment or vaccine available yet for the ravages of Ebola, which has hit the headlines in recent years in these parts and which has killed 1 200 since the virus was first discovered."
"The list of neglected diseases continues."
"We could also add, as our rapporteur does, the 121 million people living with depression."
"Nearly 9% of men worldwide and nearly 10% of women have a depressive episode each year."
"873 000 people commit suicide, and that is probably underestimated."
"50 million live with epilepsy, over 80% of them in the developing world; 24 million live with schizophrenia; 37 million live with dementia, mainly Alzheimer's and, with an ageing population, this is increasing all the time."
"In conclusion, we have listed the problems, but what are the causes?"
"Lack of clean water, lack of sanitation, lack of essential drugs, the cost of essential drugs, drug resistance issues, ineffective pesticides and drugs, drug toxicity, but above all, the main cause is the lack of political will in the developed world to do something about it."
"Our response to the SARS pandemic shows what we can do if we make communicable diseases a priority."
"This led to the establishment of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and, as our excellent rapporteur says, we urgently need the same dynamic approach to deal with the other major global diseases."
"Mr Bowis led us in relation to the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and he leads us here in this report."
"Thank you, John, you have done an excellent job."
"– Mr President, I too should like to take my turn to thank and congratulate my honourable friend John Bowis for the highly comprehensive report which he has presented to us."
"Our debate today is particularly topical in the run-up to the major UN General Assembly debate on the millennium development goals."
"However, it is also topical owing to the problem created by the emergence of avian influenza and the risks created by its transmission to Europe."
"That is why I call on Commissioner Michel to activate all the necessary mechanisms and to take all the precautions needed to protect public health in Europe."
"Every day we see a dramatic increase in diseases in developing countries, especially on the African continent."
"This situation is an insult to mankind and imposes on the international community, on the UN and on the European Union, the need for global action which will go beyond bombastic pronouncements and will immediately create and implement an integrated strategy."
"The increase in diseases is the result of the dramatic economic and social situation in which people live in developing countries."
"At the meeting of Heads of State or Government in New York, when the millennium goals will be examined, pretty words and wishes may be superfluous, but one thing is certain: none of the goals set will be achieved, especially goal no."
"International commitments and undertakings are not being kept."
"Despite the undertaking by G8 to write off the debts of the poorest developing countries, no progress has been made to date."
"Despite commitments on the integration into national legislation of WTO agreements on intellectual property rights, which help poorer countries import cheaper drugs, no progress has been made."
"Even European countries are delaying ratification and I call on the European Commission to exert all the necessary pressure in this direction."
"The European Commission must also, within the framework of humanitarian aid, demonstrate particular interest in the granting of bursaries to developing countries for the medical and nursing professions."
"Finally, I should like to comment on a particularly important problem, the problem of the increase in mental and neurological illnesses in conflict and war zones."
"I refer in particular to the case of Palestine, where Israeli occupation, the blockade of the occupied territories, poverty and imprisonment have dramatically increased the proportion of mental illness, especially among young people and women."
"The European Commission should address the problem by financing treatment programmes in cooperation with the World Health Organisation."
"Poverty and the continuing spread of illnesses are the slavery of modern times."
"We bear a huge responsibility."
"A responsibility towards world peace, security and stability."
"Thank you very much, and my warmest thanks and congratulations to Commissioner Michel, who is doing a very important job."
"Mr President, I very much welcome this report."
"In recent years waiving or reducing royalties on drugs for poor countries has been championed by the EU and I urge us not to be fainthearted in pressing for more concessions, whatever the complexity of the arguments, many of which I do not fully believe, and I say that as a European patent attorney, as well as a politician."
"Only yesterday we voted measures to compensate for the cost of research for paediatric medicine."
"Clearly, when market forces of themselves will not provide cost-effective research for drugs for our own children, it is not surprising that there are even fewer resources available for developing and poor countries."
"For malaria and TB, which are already increasing in developed countries, there are several partnership research projects under way which include a pledge to make the eventual drugs affordable for developing countries."
"One such project is being led by Oxford University."
"It aims to produce a malaria vaccine and is being run in conjunction with an Oxford biotech company and a German pharmaceutical company."
"A TB vaccine is being similarly investigated elsewhere by others."
"As well as being preventative, vaccines are usually one-off treatments, something which is an additional benefit in environments and countries where drug storage and dosage regimes are hard to follow or supply routes are insecure."
"But we have to recognise that, especially for lesser-known diseases, public funding will be essential and I believe that the EU should include this in its programmes."
"I can support this report, as will many, simply from my heart and sense of humanity, but there are reasons to support it with your pockets, for with many of these diseases delay in action will come back to bite in other ways later."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all, as has been done previously, to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Bowis, on his excellent report on major and neglected diseases, which is both comprehensive and balanced."
"On the eve of the United Nations Summit in New York, where the Millennium Goals will be at the centre of debate, this report forms part of a highly topical subject area."
"It is pointless to remind you that we already know that these goals will not be achieved in the timeframe that we had set ourselves and that they are about to be added to the list of promises broken by the rich nations."
"As three out of eight of the principal Millennium Goals concern health care issues, the work of my fellow Member, Mr Bowis, should ensure there is a greater level of awareness of this reality."
"In addition to showing the necessary awareness of the situation, I would like the European Parliament to deliver a strong and clear message to the Member States to revive the goals."
"The health care issues that the poorest countries must face fuel the spiral of their under development."
"The observation is simple; those who today have most need of treatments do not have access to them."
"Why?"
"Either because they are expensive or because fundamental research and the development of research are inadequate, indeed non-existent, for certain major and neglected diseases."
"Furthermore, when these drugs do exist and are affordable, the populations in some cases do not have access to them, as they are not adapted to the particular sanitation conditions in these countries."
"The problem is more serious and of a structural nature; while the fundamental research is mainly carried out by the public sector, the development of these drugs is almost entirely in the hands of the private sector."
"Without a guarantee of profits, the pharmaceutical industry has no interest at all in investing in the development of new molecules."
"Any innovation is therefore dependent on obtaining highly profitable patents."
"It is therefore practically impossible for populations with weak purchasing power, the vast majority of whom come from the countries targeted by the Millennium Goals, to obtain these drugs, which are vital nonetheless."
"This logic also leads to prices being fixed at an artificially high level."
"In the era of globalisation, ladies and gentlemen, the health of each person must be the responsibility of all."
"As regards drugs, it is needs that must dictate our strategy for action to deal with the worldwide issue of health and development."
"Furthermore, we must also encourage and support developing countries so that they might devote a minimum of 20% of their budgets to health care policies, policies of investment in research and development or policies for adapting intellectual property rules."
"These countries’ financial resources are, therefore, insufficient on their own."
"There can be no progress in today’s world as regards the major challenge of health care without a shared commitment from the public authorities and the private sector."
"The pharmaceutical industry must emerge from an exclusively profit-making mind-set and revise its commitments and its priorities, in particular in the research and development sector but also in the marketing sector."
"As for the public authorities, they must lay down legal frameworks, set objectives and offer perspectives that guarantee the common good while respecting the interests of each person."
"I therefore draw the attention of the Council and of the Commission to the need to take initiatives: to draft a new international treaty on research and development in medicine, to include within the seventh European Union Research Framework Programme a specific reference to research and development for neglected diseases, which would be guaranteed funding, to ensure that the Doha Declaration on compulsory licences is not challenged by bilateral trade agreements, and, finally, to encourage the swift entry into force of the Community regulation, currently being debated by Parliament and the Council, enabling the generic medicines industry to produce treatments that will prevent health care disasters with tragic repercussions for a large part of our planet."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one global megatrend is that people want to live, and keep their health, for longer, and this is also something of great concern to us in the European Union."
"Parliament has decided, by an overwhelming majority, to double the funding for the Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"I hope that the Council will act in line with our decision and enable this Seventh Framework Programme to enter into force in the shortest possible time."
"Along with doubling the budget, we also need to get the world of business involved, which, in the developing countries, means those small and medium-sized businesses that move to places where the only state structures present have to date proved themselves incapable of getting a grip on the problems."
"It follows that we should promote localised production in small and medium-sized businesses, along with those small businessmen who really are familiar with the needs and aspirations of local people, and, above all, we should also focus our attention on the services they use, such as the water supply, which has already been mentioned today."
"We should be promoting small businesses that would take responsibility for the local and regional water supply and have the right idea how to go about obtaining fresh drinking water, which is so much needed and sought after."
"In the field of development aid, we should endeavour to give guarantees, support and loans to entrepreneurs who declare themselves willing to attend to the needs of the local people in a coordinated way and in a global context."
"I think this would be a good use of resources and ask the Commissioner to consult with his fellow-Commissioner Mr Verheugen, for an initiative of this sort surely needs to be put centre stage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as Mr Rübig said, people want to live longer and healthily."
"The people in the developing countries, who are the subject of this debate, want to be allowed to live, and to live in a manner worthy of human beings."
"As one might put it: ‘poor, sick, unemployed, hopeless’ – in these countries the one state often leads to the other."
"I regard this report as an eye-opener; it raises awareness, cries out and brings us face to face with diseases that we cannot even pronounce properly even if we have any idea how many millions of people suffer from them."
"No sooner did avian flu pop up than we in Europe declared ourselves prepared for it."
"Have we, in Europe, made preparations against infection with these diseases?"
"We have not."
"Are we prepared and willing to help people fight these diseases in their own countries?"
"Not to any adequate extent."
"I want, then, to put forward three proposals."
"Here comes the first; under the Luxembourg Presidency of the Council, we resolved to raise Europe’s development aid payments to 0.7%."
"We must, I think, as a matter of urgency, join together with the Member States in planning how much of that can be spent on combating disease and on the health sector, with due regard for poverty, work and health."
"Secondly, we should increase the funding for research into them in Europe."
"Thirdly, I ask that all organisations, such as the one I chair, that receive EU funds in connection with development policy, should be invited to a conference at which we could consider how, together, we might be more effectively active in these fields in the developing countries."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to pay tribute to the quality of the report presented to us."
"I am in agreement with nearly all that has been said on this matter."
"This comes at just the right moment today: two days ago, I was in fact at the rearmament conference, if I dare say so, of the Global Fund to fight against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"There, I specificallyannounced a number of measures I intended to take, in particular to boost the research into diseases that are endemic in developing countries and poor countries and that, unfortunately, do not always interest the pharmaceutical industry, on the grounds of poor cost-effectiveness."
"I am therefore more or less in agreement in saying that the public authorities and the Member States must obviously become more involved in these policies."
"I also announced a number of measures to encourage health professionals living in Europe or elsewhere, and who are part of the diaspora, to return to their countries."
"We could implement a number of incentives to this end."
"I will not conceal the fact that I am increasingly tempted to propose a progressive plan to you shortly in order systematically to increase the proportion of our budgets devoted to education and health care, either in the tenth EDF, or in the forthcoming budget, since this issue has still not been resolved."
"In actual fact, I increasingly believe that education and health care are of the utmost importance."
"Even though we must, of course, urgently respond to a series of difficulties and harness the resources to do this, we must reflect seriously on a real – I would say almost systematic – strategy in the areas of education and health care."
"I have heard people talk about a figure of 20%, indeed 35%."
"I believe that it is perhaps difficult to envisage 35% for the moment, but we could certainly plan a gradual increase over several years of the resources invested in these two sectors."
"I also believe, although I will no doubt come back to this point later on during the debate on the European Union policy and the debate on budgetary aid, that it would be advisable to open negotiations with the governments on sectoral aid."
"This would also enable us, within a specific and coherent framework with minimum conditions, to encourage governments, as public authorities, to take charge of these priority sectors."
"I have taken note of many ideas that also appear in this report."
"I can assure you that I will draw a great deal of inspiration from them in order to carry out and propose policies to you in this area."
"Like you, I am very alert to this area, and I wish to thank all of the speakers and the rapporteur for having made available to us this excellent tool, which is a source of inspiration and which I will be sure to use."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the New Italian Socialist Party and of the Committee on Development I wish to make the following remarks."
"The health systems in developing countries are permanently in trouble: repaying and servicing the debt take up roughly 40% of GDP, while the resources allocated to education and health remain pitifully low."
"In addition to the efforts made by individual countries, the international community must, in any case, agree to supplement those investments with adequate long-term financial support."
"The hope is that the seventh framework programme, like the strategic Millennium Goals, will include a specific reference to research into the diseases that affect those countries and also allocate the appropriate funding."
"It is an absurd and, in many respects, intolerable fact that, because there are no profitable markets, there is practically no research being conducted into those diseases that almost exclusively affect poor people in developing countries."
"Such a situation needs to be put right quickly by means of a serious, tangible and prompt international commitment."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on famine in Niger (1)."
". – Mr President, we face a harsh reality: poor countries, especially the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, are hungry and rich countries are making promises."
"Climate changes on the planet, as demonstrated in the case of New Orleans and with the prolonged drought and temperature increase in Africa, do most damage to underdeveloped countries and poor populations."
"The leaders of the members of the UN due to meet in New York must realise at long last where their responsibilities lie and must move from pronouncements to specific actions."
"The dramatic famine which the people of Africa are suffering imposes the need to plan global strategic aid, not belated mercy actions."
"The objective set by G8, primarily to combat poverty and hunger in Africa, is linked to direct and bold decisions."
"However, it is undermined by the very stance of its members."
"A typical example is the continuing delay in actually writing off the debts of the poor countries."
"The anarchic liberalisation of the international trade in agricultural products is widening the gap between developed and developing countries."
"The global food crisis is now of a structural nature."
"It is threatening stability and needs international structural intervention."
"From this point of view, although humanitarian aid needs to be increased, it cannot answer Africa's serious problems."
"The crisis in Niger has confirmed the serious deficit in the UN and the European Union of early warning and prevention mechanisms."
"As the case of Niger demonstrates, this deficit is causing a huge increase in financing for ex-post humanitarian intervention."
"Nonetheless, any strategy still based solely on generous international humanitarian aid – Mr Anan has called for a tenfold increase in the UN Assistance Fund – will not be effective in the long term unless the international community starts a 'green revolution' in Africa."
"Far-reaching changes and reforms in the state, society, the economy and agricultural production are needed."
"The European Union has important comparative advantages in Africa and must put the important decisions it took at the Council of Ministers on 24 May 2005 into practice."
". Mr President, Commissioner, on 28 August, Mr Annan declared: ‘We are all responsible for the famine in Niger.’"
"Must we do the same?"
"In actual fact, I myself sent a letter to you in April in which I questioned you about the threat of famine in Niger."
"I also seize this opportunity to thank you for your response."
"Yet there we have it, we always have to wait to see horrific images on our screens before we intervene."
"Indeed, only in June, the government of Niger, which has long denied the scale of the crisis, refused the free distribution of emergency food rations, in order, it said, to avoid destabilising the market, when we know full well that the poorest people were unable to obtain and afford these reasonably priced, subsidised food products."
"We therefore keep coming back to the same question: what are we doing for this dying, declining Africa?"
"Admittedly, the world has finally turned its attention to the fate of Niger."
"Aid is finally there."
"The donors realised that this crisis was a real famine, affecting a third of the population of Niger, or 3.6 million people, which is a huge number."
"What we can still call for in our resolution is for aid reserved for these populations to be equal to demand and, of course, to reach the most vulnerable people without exception."
"Yet on that subject too, I am not telling you anything you do not already know."
"I am referring in particular to the nomadic populations, for example, who are not necessarily on the lists of the World Food Programme and who have lost almost all of their livestock, which is itself also dying of hunger."
"Consequently, a number of suicides have been recorded among the Fulani, a proud people who cannot bear to beg."
"This famine also reminds us that we must conduct a real development aid policy."
"Commissioner, I am very well aware that you can back up words with figures and actions."
"Therefore, what sustainable development project is the Commission implementing for Niger?"
"For Africa?"
"What about support for agricultural exports?"
"All these questions will constantly be asked, but I believe that, one of these days, they really will have to be resolved at European Union level."
". Although this item has the heading ‘Famine in Nigeria’ in the Czech version of the agenda, I intend to discuss the situation in Niger, as stated in other versions of the agenda, including the French, German and English versions, and in the motions for resolutions that have been tabled."
"One distinctive feature sets the African continent as a whole apart from Europe. There is a constant stream of hundreds and thousands of people crossing the continent’s borders, which were only firmly established in the first half of the 20th century, and this phenomenon is entirely impossible to control."
"Many people travel with their livestock and all their belongings, particularly in the Sahel region, to which Niger belongs, and this is why crises spread so rapidly between the various countries in this region."
"A great many people who are familiar with Niger’s abundant natural resources, such as the large deposits of uranium ore that are mined in the country, would be surprised to learn where the profits from these activities end up."
"Measures to reduce corruption and to bring pressure to bear on the country’s government to put budgetary resources to efficient use are therefore a logical and necessary first step."
"There is no denying that the imposition of VAT on flour and milk could make things worse as far as food supplies are concerned."
"The fundamental error, however, is the lack of support for modern agriculture, based on the construction of irrigation systems and water resources for the development of crop production."
"The widespread practice of nomadic pastoralism, which is particularly common in the northern part of the country, leads to desertification and an escalation of the crisis over the years."
"What is more, the fact that nomads travel across borders could result in the crisis spreading to other countries, in particular Mali and Burkina Faso."
"Two decisions must therefore be taken without delay."
"The first must be to address the immediate need for food aid, and the second to develop a broad-based programme for constructing irrigation and water resources."
"An essential addition to this programme must be a system for teaching a sufficient number of farmers about rational agricultural practices, based on crop production methods that benefit the area in question."
"In addition, trees must be planted in order to prevent desertification."
"It is likely that the most difficult task will be to restrict the practice of pastoralism in areas that are most at risk."
"Other countries in the region must also be involved in this programme, since we will otherwise be faced with an ever-increasing number of related problems as the desert spreads south."
"Food supplies only provide a short-term solution to the problem, and a broader solution needs to be found in the long term."
"Pressure to liberalise public services and to open markets up rapidly is quite clearly not what is needed, and could make the situation even more critical in the near future."
"During the vote, we should therefore endeavour to adopt a resolution worded in such a way that it can act as the basis for a genuine resolution of the problems faced both by Niger and by the region as a whole."
". Mr President, this motion reflects an anxiety, based on evidence from previous African famines, that dealing with the immediate crisis by flooding the country with foreign food aid might undercut local producers and increase poverty in the longer term."
"However, there are ways of tackling this crisis which do not risk damaging the local economy."
"The NGO Oxfam, for example, is operating income creation schemes so that people can afford to buy food."
"Oxfam has reduced the number of weak animals by buying them at a fair price and slaughtering them."
"It is also using voucher-for-work schemes, covering activities such as the removal of animal carcasses, drying of slaughtered meat and reforestation."
"The crisis in Niger this year is not exceptional; for many people, the hunger they now face is only a slight worsening of what they see every year."
"Despite short rains and locust infestation, food production this year was in fact only 11 % below the five-year average."
"Therefore, the real question is not what caused the crisis this year, but what is causing endemic hunger and poverty."
"The answer to that is complex; there are reports that, in the villages where women and children are starving, grain is lying in locked household stores, which women are forbidden by custom to enter."
"We often talk about the importance of the role of women, but there can be no starker an example than this of the damage that occurs when women are powerless."
"Only one in four girls attend primary school in Niger; if girls start to go to school then women will start to break into their own grain stores."
"Finally, we in Europe are making the long-term problem worse because of our failure to take strong enough action on climate change."
"All the agricultural improvement programmes ever invented will be useless if the desertification of the Sahel continues."
"Overgrazing and deforestation are factors, but so is the rise in the world's temperature."
"So let us have some joined-up thinking here in the European Parliament."
"Next time we are discussing measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, let us remember marginal lands and famine in Africa."
". Mr President, I should like to start by quoting the words of James Morris of the World Food Programme."
"He said, 'Niger has sent us a message in the whimpers of children too malnourished to cry for help'."
"He also said, 'Sadly, the spotlight has already shifted and donations have again dried up.'"
"That is the problem."
"2.7 million people in Niger are in urgent need of food aid."
"There is growing concern that, while food aid distribution continues across the worst affected parts of the country, financial support for emergency operations is tailing off."
"In the second half of August the WFP only received two donations."
"Funding for its emergency operation is still under 50% and $29.6 million are still needed to deliver the aid required."
"A food crisis is complex."
"Weather patterns, food production, markets, technologies, sanitation, health care, education and child-rearing practices have all played their role."
"Last year's drought coupled with the invasion of locusts, followed by drought this year, have combined with an increase in food prices, which have tripled in rural areas and doubled in cities, partly as a result of demand from neighbouring countries such as Nigeria."
"We share the view of the MSF, which has been critical of the slow response, first by the Government of Niger and then by the UN."
"The WFP only expects to deliver food rations to 110 000 people, 10% of the worst-affected area's 1.2 million."
"The concern is that the food distribution is not reaching those in the greatest need, especially children under five, and the food being distributed is not appropriate for the young children and infants who are the main victims of this current epidemic."
"We are concerned, too, that the crisis will spread to the other countries in the region."
"The wider Sahel and northern areas of Mali are already suffering and in Burkina Faso farmers have already lost up to 90% of their harvest and are having to sell their cattle to raise money for basic foods."
"We need urgent action and we need it now."
". Mr President, I echo the comments made by my Group colleague, Mrs Isler Béguin, in questioning the Commission's action in this area, but we must also play our part in this House."
"The situation in Niger almost defies description – a country of 12 million people afflicted on a regular, ongoing basis by all manner of natural disasters, compounded by domestic error and international indifference until it is too late, and by incoherence on an ongoing basis."
"It was hoped that the G8 Summit, which we in Scotland hosted, would take some brave steps towards providing an ongoing framework, perhaps giving the Commission a lead for ongoing, coherent, constructive engagement with countries like Niger."
"We were sorely disappointed, but at least the debt relief announced was a step forward."
"It is our role in this House to monitor that those words are actually turned into action."
"Perhaps we can discuss that at the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which – I am delighted to say – will be coming to Edinburgh in November."
"We in this House must play our part in providing a coherent framework and I look forward to working with the Commission on that basis."
". Mr President, today’s debate highlights one of the many tragedies of our contemporary world."
"Ours is a world in which it has been calculated that a child dies of starvation every seven minutes, despite the great advances made in technology, research, production and new techniques."
"No one present here today can even begin to imagine the agony of those dying of starvation, nor can we understand the plight of adults and children reduced to abject poverty."
"Niger is not the only place where this is happening."
"Other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and indeed elsewhere in the world are similarly afflicted."
"Niger itself is currently suffering from drought and a plague of locusts."
"As a result, five million people are starving, and over one million, including children, are in imminent danger of dying of starvation."
"This should weigh heavily on all our consciences."
"In particular, it should weigh on the consciences of those governed solely by the profit motive, who resort to market principles restricting food production, with scant regard for inalienable human rights, human dignity and moral principles."
"The much-heralded success stories propounded amongst other places from this House have become an indictment in the face of the globalisation of poverty and the threat posed to the peaceful coexistence of nations."
"Debates like the one we are engaged in today will change nothing, nor will humanitarian aid handed out by the very rich G8 countries, for whom Africa seems to have become a priority."
"Debt relief and a long-term development policy are required, and also a spirit of solidarity with countries in the developing world."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the food crisis that Niger is currently sustaining is intolerable."
"It is intolerable because populations, and children in particular, are starving and are in vital need of aid."
"Yet, the way in which this crisis has been exploited to criticise the slowness of the donors and to accuse them of failing to provide aid to people in danger, prompts me to make a handful of remarks aimed simply at presenting an objective analysis of the prevailing situation in Niger and at offering accurate information, at least with regard to European aid."
"Niger is one of the poorest countries on the planet."
"It forms part of the driest region of the Sahel, where the supply of food is always in the balance."
"Security of the food supply in Niger is extremely fragile and there are recurring malnutrition problems."
"The slightest climatic uncertainty, such as rain failures or indeed the destruction of crops by predators, be they birds or locusts, the slightest market price disruption immediately gives rise to food shortage problems."
"People use up their stocks too soon, storehouses are empty from April and food products become scarce at the markets or are sold at soaring prices."
"People have to wait until the following harvest in September or October, always assuming, of course, that there is a proper rainy season."
"The crisis that we are currently facing is, however, more severe than in previous years."
"The invasions of locusts at the end of the summer of 2004 and the poor rainfall in several areas of the Sahel, and particularly in certain regions of Niger, resulted in a very poor harvest."
"As far back as September 2004, the Commission released EUR 25.5 million for the anti-locust campaign in the most affected countries of the Sahel, that is to say Senegal, Chad, Mauritania, Mali and Niger, and funds have been allocated to the FAO (the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation)."
"As far back as February/March 2005, the warning signs of a difficult food shortage emerged in Niger."
"There was a rapid increase in the price of grain, a drop in the price of livestock, a mass and premature transhumance of herds and a shortage of local food products at the markets."
"In March, the Government of Niger, relying on information from the national agency for the prevention and management of food crises, broadly supported by the Commission, released money to buy 42 000 tonnes of grain resold cheaply, and distributed food in return for work requiring high-intensity labour."
"For its part, the World Food Programme, intervening in support of the national agency, launched an appeal for a sum of EUR 2.3 million, to which the Commission responded immediately with an allocation of EUR 1 million."
"At that time, no one, not the government, the WFP or the NGOs, were able, due to the lack of precise overall data, to assess whether it was a slightly more difficult crisis than in previous years or a serious food crisis."
"The Commission consequently made contact with aid organisations to ascertain their analysis, and, above all, their plan, as we did not receive any request for funding at that time."
"None of the NGOs, and none of the operating bodies with which we currently work, contacted us to make an appeal to us, as is usually the case, given that, as you know, the Commission itself does not participate in this type of intervention operation."
"It was only at the end of May and beginning of June that the nutritional surveys carried out in certain areas of the country revealed the crisis underway."
"It was then that the humanitarian partners appeared."
"The Commission thus took two urgent decisions, through ECHO, to release a total amount of EUR 6.3 million."
"That is the chronology of events."
"What is the situation today?"
"A recent ECHO evaluation mission concluded that nutritional requirements are today being met to a satisfactory degree, even though there is some delay in implementing the aid."
"The Commission is obviously prepared to step up its aid if additional needs emerge."
"At present, what is needed is effective coordination between the partners on the ground to enable them to target areas successfully and to speed up the aid."
"The European Commission has also released EUR 2 million for Mali, EUR 4.6 million for Eritrea and EUR 4.5 million for Ethiopia, countries that have also been affected by food and nutrition crisis situations."
"This crisis concerns us, and calls for us all to learn the lessons from it in full."
"For my part, I can see two main lessons."
"With regard to Niger first of all, it is crucial that, in addition to humanitarian efforts, a long-lasting solution be found to addressing the country’s vulnerability, by enhancing the food security strategy."
"That is precisely the policy that has been adopted by the Commission over many years in an attempt to respond to this crisis on a long-term basis."
"I am mainly referring to irrigation projects, projects to build reservoirs and so forth, which benefit from Community funding."
"Niger’s national early warning systems and mechanisms for detecting food shortages must be supported and enhanced."
"Rural development and market organisation programmes form part of this objective, as do school meals."
"The Commission is Niger’s principal donor."
"The ninth EDF has enabled this country to benefit from a funding package of nearly EUR 400 million, including EUR 60.6 million for developing food security."
"The budget heading ‘food security’ is devoting EUR 15 million to a support programme (2004 to 2006) for the national agency for the prevention and management of food crises."
"But for a handful of European countries, the Commission is, however, practically alone in helping this country."
"The debates, which will begin next year, on allocations after the ninth EDF will without doubt take account of the lessons learnt from this food crisis."
"Yet, it must be stated right now that, whatever the Commission may do for Niger, the challenge remains immense."
"It will be difficult to rise to it without more substantial development aid from the entire international community."
"Increasing the funding for development aid is, as you know, the Commission’s priority, and that is the message we will deliver in New York."
"Secondly, with regard to the response from the international aid organisations, I regret to observe that it could have been better coordinated and been the subject of greater coordination with the Government of Niger and among the aid organisations, be they NGOs or United Nations agencies, and whether at the warning and detection stage or at the stage of responding to the crisis and targeting needs."
"The Commission is prepared to give its backing to an independent evaluation aimed at identifying the means for improving aid coordination in a similar situation."
"I would like to say a word about donor action."
"I confess to being troubled – I do not disguise the fact – by the remarks made by certain humanitarian organisations. As a donor, the Commission could have acted more swiftly if, in the spring, it had discovered, there at the scene, the humanitarian organisations it had hoped to find."
"I note, however, that, once the media machine snowballed, there was no longer any difficulty in finding partners prepared to come to Niger."
"I have always paid tribute to the expertise and commitment of the humanitarian organisations that are our partners, but the remarks that I heard from a number of them about the food crises in Africa, whether in the Sahel, the Horn of Africa or South Africa, asserting that the problem was due to the inadequate donor response, surprised me."
"It is pushing it, intellectually, to argue along those lines."
"The food crises in Africa – as you are very well aware – are complex phenomena that are the result of several factors: the climate, demographics, the state of health of the populations – one only has to think, for example, of the disastrous effects of AIDS in southern Africa as a result of lower physical resistance – political governance and economic governance."
"To claim that donor aid would be enough to prevent these crises does not appear to me to be entirely fair."
"It is also, furthermore, a slightly paternalistic and moralistic attitude, which I reject."
"Rest assured that the Commission will remain extremely vigilant, and I hope that, from now on, when we become aware of a problem and an appeal is made, we will find operator and partner organisations to enable us to work more swiftly."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on seven motions for a resolution on breaches of human rights in China, in particular as regards freedom of religion(1)."
". Mr President, religious freedom is a fundamental human right and an important indicator of the level of civilisation of a society."
"Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that religion has in some cases been exploited for political and economic gains."
"Nor can it be denied that religious fanaticism has, in some cases, led to many extremist manifestations aimed at our democratic institutions."
"In essence, the balance between religious freedom and adequate protection of the citizen is a very fine one and requires extreme wisdom in framing legislation, coupled with an honest determination to apply it correctly."
"Not unexpectedly, such will is lacking in totalitarian states, where religion is perceived merely as a possible threat to the political stability of the ruling regimes."
"This, it appears, is the case with China."
"Recently, thanks to international pressure, the Chinese Government put into effect new regulations on religious affairs, but it is already abundantly evident that these changes do not go far enough and policies limiting religious freedom persist."
"Numerous examples of persecution and harassment of religious groups and individuals in China are well documented and need not be mentioned here again."
"We call on the Chinese Government to put a real end to religious repression in the country and, furthermore, to immediately release from detention and stop the prosecution of all individuals persecuted by the state authorities as a consequence of their religious beliefs and practices."
"I urge you to support this joint motion for a resolution."
". Mr President, we should welcome the development of the relationship between the European Union and China in the areas of trade, economics, culture and politics."
"China could become a strategic partner for the European Union in the effort to create a new world order."
"It should be borne in mind, however, that a genuine partnership must be built on the foundation of shared values."
"Our positive approach to China cannot overlook violations of human rights in the People’s Republic of China, nor can it condone attacks on political and trade union freedoms."
"We must never forget either that China is not a democracy."
"In its resolution, the European Parliament highlights violations of fundamental human rights in China, notably concerning freedom of religion, and in particular as regards Christian churches and denominations."
"We call on the Chinese authorities to put an end to strict controls, repression and persecution of religious groups, both Christian and others."
"I have in mind also Tibetan Buddhism and Islam."
"The Roman Catholic Church has largely been driven underground."
"This is a cause of great concern for us, as is the situation of the Protestant churches."
"In addition, we call for explanations of the fate of certain Roman Catholic bishops and missing priests."
"We call for the release of Catholic priests and Protestant clergy who have been arrested and imprisoned, and for the release of all lay persons punished for their religious practices."
"The Chinese authorities must undertake to guarantee compliance with Article 36 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China, which provides for freedom of religion in China."
"I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the information provided by the organisation Reporters Without Borders, concerning the conviction of Mr Shi Tao, an Internet user."
"On 30 April 2005 a court in Changsha sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment for revealing State secrets."
"Mr Shi Tao was a journalist working for the economic publication, and his crime was to publish on the Internet information contained in a confidential Central Propaganda Department document, forwarded to the editorial department prior to the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre."
"The action of the Yahoo Internet portal that revealed Mr Shi Tao’s details to the court should also be investigated."
". Mr President, China is once again the subject of debate in this House, and I fear that this will not be the last time that we deal with this issue."
"The growing relations between the European Union and China offer a great opportunity for both parties, and I would go as far as to say even for the world in general."
"Nevertheless, these relations cannot be based solely on improving the commercial relations of each party."
"If what the European Union wants is policy on China to be credible, it must demand much more clearly that it radically improve its policy on human rights."
"The European Union-China dialogue on human rights is a good instrument for doing this, but I fear that it is clearly being underused."
"There are various problems that China is not dealing with responsibly, given its role in the world, which is becoming increasingly interdependent: trade union freedom, freedom of expression, press freedom and also religious freedom."
"I am one of those who advocate that governmental and public institutions should be secular in nature and that it is essential to ensure the separation of political and religious powers, but I also believe that true secularism must guarantee freedom of religious practice in the private sphere."
"I am therefore concerned about the constant complaints from various groups concerning the difficulties they face practising their religion in China."
"Just as I oppose a State providing special finance and support for a particular religion rather than others — a few days ago, for example, I condemned the fact that the Commission had dedicated so much money to the World Youth Days promoted by the Catholic Church — I do not believe it is acceptable for institutions to violate the individual right to religious freedom."
"As such, this is a human rights issue that we must complain about and denounce."
"In summary, in this Resolution we are calling on the Chinese authorities to put an immediate end to all religious repression, to ensure respect for international standards of human rights and to guarantee democracy, freedom of expression, association and the press, and also, as the Resolution states, religious freedom in all territory controlled by the Chinese authorities."
"."
"Mr President, present-day China is still being ruled by a party that is Communist in name but has not – and this is certainly true of its leadership – been Communist for many years."
"These days, nothing matters except the pursuit of economic growth and export benefits on the world market, achieved by low wages, poor working conditions and the banning of independent trade unions, all of which is highly reminiscent of the dictatorial model which South Korea used in the past in order to become an industrialised nation."
"Whether the large majority of the people will gain any benefits from this will not be evident until a few decades down the line."
"Meanwhile, a society has been created with large discrepancies between the people in terms of power and income and with major disregard for nature, landscape and the environment."
"It is a far cry from the protection of man and the environment that we Socialists hold dear."
"Although the Chinese leaders are no longer Communists, they have unfortunately retained the worst features of the Communist state tradition."
"They do not tolerate independent organisations and other centres of power alongside them."
"People can adhere to a faith, but are not allowed to organise themselves to any serious degree."
"The leadership fears that independent churches could become a source of opposition, and so, in line with a combination of atheist tradition and power politics, it is the government that decides which faiths shall be permitted and under what circumstances."
"It is a matter of general knowledge that it is not the official Catholic Church that is allowed, but a nationally controlled variant."
"Less well known is the fact that the Jewish faith – which, before the revolution of 1949, had a large following, particularly in the large cities along the East coast – is completely banned."
"We should not give this China the opportunity to threaten neighbouring countries or clamp down on domestic opposition."
"It should therefore go without saying that the arms embargo should be enforced."
"Under no circumstances should EU Member States be allowed to sell arms to China."
"Any attempt to lift the arms embargo would be reprehensible."
"It would not be in anybody’s interest to launch a new costly arms race and incite new threats."
"That is exactly why Europe, too, should press for disarmament."
". Mr President, while I congratulate Mr Meijer on his excellent and very precise speech, I have to say that I was amazed to hear what some Members said earlier on."
"No wonder Christians are so brutally deprived of their rights and persecuted as they currently are when we consider how some of Europe’s leadership class behave."
"Even in this House, there are those who, when they speak, cannot bring themselves to denounce the violations of Christians’ human rights in China unless they have prefaced them with expressions of hostility to the Church that have nothing whatever to do with this issue, and who, in a debate devoted to the fundamental rights of victims of persecution, cannot refrain from indulging in criticism of World Youth Day."
"While there is of course no Christian monopoly in this European Union of ours, and quite rightly not, 85% of the EU’s inhabitants are Christian, 56% being Catholics."
"These people, too, have a right to appropriate political representation."
"Who is supposed to speak up, not only for the persecuted and tiny Christian minorities in China, but also for that country’s Jews, Muslims and Buddhists, if we do not?"
"The Islamic world takes up the cause of their brothers and sisters of the Muslim faith who are persecuted in places such as China; it is only we Europeans who have to keep on downplaying these violations of human rights or adopting a critical attitude."
"In so doing, we make ourselves complicit in them."
"Seeing the pictures of Mr Blair at the EU/China summit reminds me of how it was he who told us that the EU was for him more than a free trade zone."
"I see no evidence of that being so, for, if he really did regard it as a community of values, he would adopt a foreign policy that focused on human rights – including these human rights – even in his dealings with a large country such as China."
"The same can be said of Chancellor Schröder, to whose solitary attempt at relaxing the arms embargo we have, thank God, put a stop."
"We need a unity that transcends party boundaries if we are to speak out clearly, even to a large country such as China, in the cause of human rights and religious freedom."
"Mr President, I would like to quote a brief, revealing excerpt from a letter by an anonymous Chinese Protestant: ‘I am really looking forward to receiving spiritual food’, something which, according to him, is in short supply in the official Protestant church because the state keeps it on an ideological leash."
"It is precisely this government violation of the freedom of religion in the People’s Republic of China that has led to a growing stream of flourishing, non-registered Protestant house churches."
"In the light of China’s new rules in religious matters that took effect on 1 March this year, they are exposed to a wave of random government repression, including cruel disturbances of services, hefty fines, arrests, destruction of private houses and beatings or reprimands along the lines of ‘teachers cannot believe in Christianity’."
"What was particularly shocking was the account of the raid on 7 August this year on a Protestant house church in Shenyang province."
"Among the thirty worshippers, there were some 10 women who were forced first to undress and then to pose naked."
"Those who offered resistance were brutally beaten up."
"During a recent inquiry into whether it is the central government or local authorities that are responsible for the violations of freedom of religion in China, a salient point came to light."
"Some local authorities are sympathetic towards Christian fellow citizens and actively protect them on account of their loyal contribution to the local economic and social development."
"This is a practical example that the Chinese central government would do well to follow, because after all, it always determines what exactly normal religious activities are, and it is those alone that are permitted by law."
"Commissioner, I would ask you, your fellow-Commissioners, or else the Council, to explain in detail to the Chinese authorities this disturbing criterion for the fundamental right of freedom of religion."
"What are normal religious activities?"
"More than anything, I hope that you and the Council will press for the release of all those who, whatever their beliefs, are imprisoned or suffer under the lack of freedom of religion in China."
". Mr President, sadly, it is becoming traditional for us to devote Thursday afternoons to debating actions perpetrated by the Chinese authorities against their own people and against all others they have subjugated."
"I would remind the House that we recently debated violations of human rights in Tibet."
"The term violations of human rights is somewhat of a euphemism, when the actions actually being referred to include murder, imprisonment, mass disappearances, and when people are prevented from practising their religion and there is no question of freedom of any sort."
"Let us call a spade a spade."
"This should be termed criminal activity, not violations of human rights."
"We have been observing events in China for the last 60 years."
"Those of us who hail from former Communist states know full well how Communist authorities tend to behave, regardless of whether they are ideologically committed to Communism or not."
"That is immaterial."
"I speak from personal experience, and still have a strong memory of the early years of Communism in Poland."
"Quite simply, it is a case of a vicious Communist or post-Communist dictatorship."
"Everyone is persecuted."
"Believers in Islam, Buddhism, Jews ... all are hunted down."
"As to those that are persecuted most cruelly ... well, perhaps not, because in Tibet Buddhists have been persecuted equally cruelly, but it should be said that Christians and especially Catholics are persecuted."
"In particular, those Catholics are targeted who adhere to a fundamental principle of the Catholic Church, namely unity with the wider church, personified in the Pope."
"Certain schisms have been encouraged, and a national church has come into being, though obviously this could never be recognised."
"Things are getting worse, not better."
"As stated in our resolution, the number of arrests is increasing."
"So too is the number of cases of torture, unexplained disappearances, detentions through the criminal system, and the number of isolation camps."
"The very term ‘isolation camp’ should make our blood run cold."
"We Europeans are well aware of the horrors perpetrated under Nazi German and Communist Russian domination."
"The European Union has had diplomatic relations with China for 30 years."
"There has been much talk of dialogue."
"I wonder about the nature of this dialogue and what it involves."
"It seems to mean this House adopting one resolution after another on Thursday afternoons when most Members are already on their way home."
"At the same time, however, others who could have a significant influence on what might take place in China are presenting the case for a relaxation of the embargo."
"France and Germany are doing so particularly eloquently, maintaining that the embargo is ineffective."
"All this is happening in the context of a situation when we should be isolating China as much as possible."
"This is not just about economics."
"Above all, it is about moral principles."
"The European Union should make it abundantly clear that there can be no deals or dialogue of any kind with China."
"China deserves outright condemnation."
". Mr President, last week Tang Jaixuan, a former Foreign Minister of the People’s Republic of China, said to the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights that every country should promote and protect human rights in its own way, and that there should be no outside interference in this respect."
"We simply cannot go along with this view."
"Respect for fundamental human rights, including freedom of religion, is not an internal Chinese concern."
"It is a concern for all those who are not egotists or opportunists."
"We should bear in mind that freedom of religion is also possible in non-democratic countries."
"Czechs, Jews and people from the Netherlands emigrated to Poland in the 16th century not because our country was a democracy, but because all religions could be practised in complete freedom in Poland."
"We should also remember, however, that there were and still are political systems that only recognise religious leaders of different persuasions if they support the theory that all authority is God-given, even the cruellest."
"China should respect not only freedom of religion, but also the independence of churches and religious associations."
"Secular authorities cannot be allowed to influence decisions on who might become a Catholic bishop, the 15th Dalai Lama or the 12th Panchen Lama."
"Tibetan monks cannot be compelled to attend ideological training."
"The 87-year-old Gongola Lama has stated that on training courses of that nature, instructors indoctrinate the monks on the nature of love for the common Chinese fatherland, and mould them into subservience to the law."
"They also teach the monks that the Dalai Lama is a danger."
"Certain monks are forced to sign a document stating that they no longer recognise the spiritual and political leadership of the Dalai Lama."
"World history is full of accounts of repression for religious motives."
"It is worth remembering, however, that such repression proved ineffective, even under the cruellest of regimes."
"It will prove ineffective in China as well."
"It does not matter if a person has their work or property taken away, is imprisoned, expelled, crucified or gassed."
"Neither the Pope nor the Dalai Lama can call up any so-called divisions, because the source of religious strength is not to be found in believers or in the clergy, but in the very nature of religion itself."
"For most religions, death is not a tragic end but the start of a new life."
". Mr President, religious freedom is a fundamental human right and, as a previous speaker said, the Chinese Constitution claims, at Article 36, to allow for freedom of religious belief, yet the rhetoric is not the reality."
"One example given by Amnesty International was the case of Zhang Rongliang, who was the leader of one of the largest house church networks in China."
"He was detained in his village; the police searched every house in that village, confiscating any Christian material; his wife and child have been in hiding; he has been imprisoned five times for a total of 12 years, during which time he was severely tortured."
"This House has also raised the case of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, the Tibetan monk, who was sentenced to death by the Chinese authorities in an unfair trial."
"He is now in prison for life, but no one knows where he is being held, and his family would like to know."
"Until China deals seriously with religious freedom, we will have to highlight human rights abuses in this House."
"We have to speak up for those who do not have the freedom to speak for themselves."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an established fact that China is well known for its scant regard for human rights."
"Any further emphasis would be euphemistic."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what is lacking in this Parliament’s resolutions – including cross-party resolutions like this one – is a little intellectual honesty."
"Paragraph 3, which asks that it should be made clear to the Chinese authorities that a genuine partnership can only develop when shared values are fully respected and put into practice, ends up being hypocritical."
"The resolution then becomes ridiculous when, after listing a lamentable series of breaches and making the usual demands, it welcomes the fact of having a EU-China human rights structured dialogue."
"Not a word of serious condemnation, let alone any suggestion of sanctions."
"Associating oneself with this resolution would be to make oneself a laughing-stock and morally complicit with the most violent combination of free-market and communist ideas that has ever occurred."
"I urge my fellow Members not to vote for this resolution."
"Mr President, the People’s Republic of China is not complying with the principle of respect for the fundamental human rights of the individual."
"For many years now, Communist China had been failing to meet the most basic universal standards and requirements concerning freedom of expression, thought, action and creation."
"At the most recent EU-China Ministerial meeting in May 2005, the Union expressed its concern with regard to four aspects of human rights."
"In particular, it called for those still imprisoned further to the 1989 pro-democracy movement to be released, for censorship of the media to be reduced, for the ‘re-education through work’ system to be reformed, and for ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"We ought also to be calling for an end to repression of the Roman Catholic Church."
"The latter is not recognised by the regime."
"Over 126 families lost loved ones in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and the circumstances surrounding that event remain unclear."
"According to Amnesty International by the end of last year alone over 50 persons were imprisoned for publishing on the Internet information that could be damaging to the authorities."
"Amnesty International has also reported that 3 400 people were executed and over 6 000 sentenced to death in 2004 in China."
"These statistics are truly alarming."
"The Chinese Government is mercilessly exterminating the people of Tibet."
"It is resorting to false accusations of law-breaking, fixing the outcome of trials in advance and organising mass deportations of Tibetans from areas subsequently resettled with ethnic Chinese."
"Over 100 Tibetan religious leaders are being held in Chinese prisons on charges of subversive activity."
"The world is standing idly by as one of the oldest and most important cultures of all times vanishes before its very eyes."
"How many more tragedies and statistics will it take for the world to start taking notice of the violations of human rights being perpetrated in China?"
"Diplomacy will fail to produce the desired outcome."
"The Union must rise to an enormous challenge."
"Its action will determine whether China will manage to take specific measures in response to the calls for it to change its policy towards its own people."
"Mr President, China is a great nation and has been a great civilisation, but its name and standing are diminished by its human rights abuses."
"I want the Chinese to listen to the words of my colleagues and to this resolution on religious freedom."
"I want them to release the Catholics and Christians in prison."
"I want them to bring justice to the Muslims, the Uigurs in Xinjiang."
"I want them to bring justice to the Tibetans and withdraw their threat of imposing their Panchen Lama."
"I want them to stop the abuse of psychiatry."
"I want them to listen to the voice of Miss Fen Yang, arrested when visiting friends and sentenced without trial to two years in a female labour camp, where she is abused and brainwashed."
"I want them to listen to the mother of Wang Nan, who died in Tiananmen Square."
"Her mother was arrested for receiving a parcel of T-shirts."
"Those are the abuses that we cannot tolerate."
"Only if China listens, acts and puts an end to these abuses will it earn and deserve our respect."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to reply on behalf of my fellow Member, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"Although significant progress has been made on human rights issues in China over recent years, in particular in the area of economic and social rights, the European Union remains concerned by the overall human rights situation in the country and, more specifically, by the restrictions on civil and political rights that have been enforced."
"Respect for human rights is, in fact, a crucial component of the European Union’s external policy."
"The European Union has regularly raised this issue with the Chinese authorities in a frank and open manner, both through political dialogue – including at the top level, as was recently the case during the last bilateral summit held in Beijing on 5 September – and through the bilateral dialogue specifically devoted to human rights."
"In the framework of the European-Chinese dialogue, the issue of freedom of belief, religion, expression and association has always been one of the main priorities of the European Union."
"The Union, in particular, has continually expressed its deep concern regarding the situation of individuals who have been persecuted or stripped of their fundamental rights for having openly practised their faith, no matter, moreover, what their religion or belief."
"A number of imprisoned religious figures mentioned by Members of this House appear on the list of individual cases that the Union systematically sends to its Chinese negotiating partners in the framework of the human rights dialogue."
"Furthermore, the European Union has, on several occasions, officially approached the Chinese authorities through its representatives in Beijing."
"Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche and Pastor Zhang Rongliang – to mention some recent examples – are among those on whom these actions have been focused."
"The abolition of the death penalty, or at least the introduction of a moratorium on its application, China’s swift ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and cooperation with the United Nations’ mechanisms also feature among the priority issues regularly addressed with the Chinese authorities."
"In the latter case, the European Union specifically made calls, during the last session of the human rights dialogue held in Luxembourg on 24 and 25 February 2005, for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief to be able to travel to China as soon as possible."
"The European Union undoubtedly intends to continue and develop the dialogue with Beijing in the area of human rights through seminars connected to these issues. Alongside the dialogue, these seminars also make it possible to raise the awareness of certain major players in Chinese civil society."
"We hope that the next session of the specific dialogue on human rights, which will take place in Beijing on 24 and 25 October 2005, will enable significant progress to be made."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of this afternoon’s debates."
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on political prisoners in Syria(1)."
". Mr President, this Parliament has dealt with the issue of human rights violations by Syria in the past, and there is no doubt that, following both European Union and international pressure, some improvements in the field of respect for human rights have been accomplished over recent years."
"Unfortunately, however, these improvements do not go far enough."
"The example of the continued imprisonment of two ill parliamentarians, Riad Seif and Mamoun al-Homsi, and the recent persecution of many civil activists, such as Hasan Zeino and Yassin al-Hamwi, are pertinent proof of that."
"As is, indeed, the Syrian authorities' continued tactic of imposing obstacles on the registration and free operation of non-governmental human rights organisations in the country."
"As well, of course, as the tactic of intimidating and harassing numerous Syrian human rights activists."
"The Syrian Government must realise that this situation is unacceptable to the EU, and its continuation will no doubt hinder the accomplishment of a future EU-Syria Association Agreement."
"We call upon the Syrian authorities, and especially the current President, Mr Bashar al-Assad, who has given hopeful signs of wanting to open up the Syrian political system, dominated for many years by the Ba'ath party, to proceed in a speedy and determined fashion in the much needed process of democratisation and reform of his country."
"Such changes will not only earn him and his Government much respect abroad but, more importantly, they will greatly benefit the Syrian people."
"Colleagues, I urge you to support this joint motion for a resolution."
". Mr President, Commissioner, if we had to choose the subjects of our debates today, in relation to breaches of human rights, we would perhaps have chosen Tunisia, where human rights defenders were besieged yesterday by the Tunisian army."
"The problem concerning Tunisia demonstrates in a general manner how seriously we treat human rights in our Association Agreements."
"That is the reason why we wanted this resolution on Syria."
"We want Syria to open up and become democratic."
"For months now, we have been calling for cases involving political prisoners such as Riad Seif and Mamoun al-Homsi to be treated seriously."
"Mrs Patrie and I, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the President of Parliament, Mr Borrell, sent letters in August calling for the release of these two political prisoners who have already served two thirds of their prison sentences."
"They are former members of Parliament who are in a poor physical condition."
"These letters have remained unanswered."
"We want the forthcoming Association Agreement with Syria to clearly indicate that human rights are a condition on which we will not compromise. We do not wish to isolate Syria."
"It is a country that we consider to be a friendly country, which must become democratic and which we can assist."
"However, for the time being, we are keen to address the following message to the Syrian Government: now that it is time to reach a decision on this Association Agreement, please take this message seriously; do not think that, in every instance, we will have to table resolutions in order to finally start a constructive dialogue with Syria on human rights, in particular with the subcommittee on human rights that we are calling on you to set up."
". Mr President, while we are in the midst of celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona Process, we must remember that respect for human rights is one of the cornerstones of Euro-Mediterranean Association and, in this context, the Resolution we are voting on today on the situation of political prisoners in Syria deserves special attention."
"We would therefore call upon the Commission, the Council and the Member States to make it clear to the Syrian authorities that the agreement we are currently negotiating must include clear clauses on human rights, as established by the Euro-Mediterranean Association."
"Furthermore, like Mrs De Keyser, we are calling for the establishment, within the context of the Association Agreement, of a sub-committee on human rights in relation to Syria, as has been done in the case of Jordan or Morocco, with a view to holding a structured dialogue on human rights and democracy."
"This sub-committee would become a key element of the action plan."
"Finally, we must once again insist on the importance of consulting and involving civil society in the work of this sub-committee, in order to better supervise the human rights situation."
". Mr President, even before the era when power ended up in the hands of father and son al-Assad, Syria laboured under the belief that that country deserved to be much bigger and more powerful than it really is, and that it should include Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine and parts of Iraq."
"Syria blames France and Great Britain for needlessly splitting up these regions, which they had won from Turkey in the First World War and for hence making impossible their return to the greater Syria that existed before the Ottoman Empire."
"Over 40 years ago, the desire for greatness caused Syria to join with Egypt and Yemen in leading the attempt to create a United Arab Republic."
"It was when this project failed and Syria also lost the Golan area in 1967 to Israel that the seeds of an authoritarian and militaristic regime were sown."
"The regime is intolerant of ethnic minorities, of Christianity and of interpretations of Islam that deviate from the version propagated by the state."
"It is also intolerant towards domestic opposition, distrustful of neighbouring countries and even more distrustful of great powers further away."
"Over the years, violent acts by exiles from other countries have been supported from Syrian territory and it is also suspected that recent political assassinations in Lebanon were organised from Syria."
"The European Union hopes to establish strong relations with all the states in its immediate surroundings, including all countries around the Mediterranean."
"Indeed, if Turkey ever joins the European Union, Syria will become our immediate neighbour, as will Iraq."
"My group thinks that it is not only economic or military considerations that should play a role as our relationship with Syria becomes even deeper."
"The European Union must place more emphasis on the release of political prisoners, the right to opposition and the government’s democratisation."
"How will the Commission do this?"
"Whilst we should appreciate the circumstances as a result of which Syria has ended up in this bad situation at present, we should not resign ourselves to this."
"The democratisation of Syria now takes priority over closer trading relations."
"The al-Assad family’s criminal regime must not be rewarded for bad behaviour."
"By taking this line, we will contribute to making Syria democratic, and the recognition of a Palestinian state will also have a part to play in this."
". Mr President, Syria remains under President Bashar al-Assad, the sole Baathist regime left in the Arab world following the demise of Iraqi Baathism."
"Since 1963, Syria has operated under a state of perpetual emergency, which is the legal basis for many of the repressive instruments imposed by the government and which it justifies on the grounds of the ongoing conflict with Israel following Syria's loss of the Golan Heights in 1967 and the struggle against Islamist terrorists who oppose the secular socialist state."
"More recently, as Syria has pursued a more active engagement with the EU through participating in the Barcelona Process and signing a EuroMed association agreement, all areas of its domestic policy have been subject to intense international scrutiny, in particular its poor human rights track record and alleged holding of political prisoners, with deaths in custody and arbitrary arrests, the preventing of free assembly or of citizens from leaving the country, and, of course, the use of torture."
"Matters have not been helped by Syria's lamentable behaviour in turning a blind eye to Islamist terrorists crossing into Iraq from its territory in spite of its own fight against Islamism, as well as its covert support to terrorist training for Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah, in spite of its continuing denials of such support."
"Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon under international pressure has been marred by the arrest of the pro-Syrian security chiefs in connection with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, a fierce critic of the Syrian regime."
"Syria remains a one-party state although there is talk of ending this state of affairs."
"This resolution calls for clemency for a number of cases cited by Amnesty International and there can be no doubt that the plight of the stateless Kurds in Hassake and the discrimination against the still remaining small Jewish community are totally unacceptable."
"As rapporteur on the European neighbourhood policy, I believe that it is nevertheless important to keep Syria engaged in dialogue with the EU and to encourage the process of democratisation and observation of fundamental human rights which Syria has signed up to in its international obligations - obligations which it must meet if it really wants to enjoy a beneficial EuroMed action plan in future."
". Mr President, I would like to follow on from Mr Tannock’s conclusion."
"When President Bashir Assad succeeded his father in office, he was the focus of a great deal of hope."
"Syrian Christians who know him well tell me that he, as a member of the Alawi minority himself, has a very tolerant attitude towards other faith communities, not least the Christians."
"It is all the more disappointing that the Baath regime’s brutal machinery of oppression is still operational, with the secret services at work in Lebanon, and the police in Syria itself."
"I would like to emphasise that, as we have ties with Syria through the Mediterranean dialogue and the Mediterranean community, we have to apply particularly rigorous standards to it."
"While we ought to support it in its desire to draw closer to the European Union, we cannot do so unless it upholds fundamental human rights and moves towards pluralism and democracy."
"That such a thing can happen only step by step is obvious, but the process must be begun without delay, and we must send a clear message to that effect."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the partnership between Europe and the Mediterranean countries has already enabled significant progress to be made on the road to constructing a foundation of shared values: human rights, representative democracy, equality between men and women and social progress."
"In this respect, the opening of an electoral process in Egypt which is, admittedly, imperfect and the regained sovereignty of Lebanon are cases in point."
"Unfortunately, the recent events in Tunisia show us that it is difficult to progress along that road."
"That is why questions must clearly be asked about the conditional nature of our partnerships."
"If an Association Agreement concluded with a country is seriously breached, this should be able to bring about its suspension, even on a temporary basis."
"In Syria, the arrival in power of President Al-Assad has given rise to a great deal of hope."
"Conflicting political signs are, however, reaching us, allowing some confusions and uncertainties to remain as regards completing the ratification process for the Association Agreement."
"In my role as Chairman of the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, I recently took a delegation from our Parliament to Syria."
"During this visit and particularly in the presence of President Al-Assad himself, we laid a great deal of emphasis on the need to respect fundamental freedoms and on the need to secure the release of the two former parliamentarians, Mr Seif and Mr al-Homsi."
"Their release is the subject of an item in the report on the visit, drafted by our Mashreq Delegation."
"The release – I quote – ‘of the two imprisoned Syrian parliamentarians is a preliminary condition for the signing of the Association Agreement.’"
"The vote on this urgent resolution will act as a powerful message from our Parliament: respect for human rights and respect for fundamental freedoms are non-negotiable factors in our partnerships."
"Mr President, the UN was quite right to express concern about violations of human rights in Syria."
"I fully support the European Parliament’s motion for a resolution calling on the Syrian authorities to release political prisoners held in that country. Their number includes several Syrian parliamentarians we consider to be our colleagues."
"Syria must be persuaded to ratify the convention banning the torture of prisoners."
"It is, however, difficult for me to support the proposal in the draft calling on Syria to guarantee that those arrested will be well treated."
"After all, we know that this refers to political prisoners, so we ought really to be insisting that no political prisoners are ever taken, and not condoning the fact and politely asking Syria not to be too cruel to them."
"It is essential for human rights and Syria’s respect for them to be a when it comes to the Union entering into an Association Agreement with Syria."
"It would be inconceivable for us to be associated with a country that held political prisoners and practised torture and other forms of anti-democratic repression, resulting in the persecution of religious minorities such as Jews or Christians."
"– Mr President, unfortunately the hopes cultivated even about the recent conference of the Ba'ath party in Syria have quickly been dashed."
"The regime continues its anti-democratic methods and autocratic practices against any protestors."
"President Assad appears to be too weak to overturn the autocratic, nepotistic and back-scratching regime which permeates the political system."
"The two former members of parliament in prison whose immediate release we are calling for – together with an immediate end to all political prosecutions – are also victims of the accusation of nepotistic behaviour on the part of the regime."
"However, I believe that it will be in the interests of the people of Syria and their rights for the European Union to sign and ratify the association agreement."
"This will give us more tools to control and exert pressure, such as the human rights clause and structured political dialogue."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission fully participates in the European Union’s efforts to support human rights in Syria."
"On the basis of the principles outlined in the Barcelona Process Declaration, our goal is to establish a constructive human rights dialogue with the Syrian authorities."
"In this context, the European Union troika has, in the past, taken steps following the arrests of opposition figures, including Mr Al-Turk, and the judgment on two parliamentarians, Mr al-Homsi and Mr Riad Seif."
"Very recently, the Commission conveyed to the Syrian Ambassador its grave concern regarding the detention of public figures and of members of Parliament and, more specifically, that of Mr al-Homsi and Mr Seif."
"The European Commission’s Delegation in Damascus is very closely monitoring the detention of these two political prisoners."
"A short time ago, the Head of Delegation drew this situation to the attention of the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Moallem."
"The attempt to have Mr al-Homsi and Mr Seif released was a failure even though, under Syrian law, they could be granted early release after serving three quarters of their prison sentences."
"The law, however, requires the two political prisoners to sign a declaration announcing that they will cease all future political activities detrimental to the Syrian State."
"They refused to sign it."
"From a Syrian point of view, therefore, nothing more can be done to release the prisoners."
"We can also observe conflicting, yet positive, signs, which are perhaps the outcome of international pressure: consider, for example, the acquittal in June of this year of Aktham Naisseh, a human rights activist."
"However, the overall situation is, unfortunately, unsatisfactory, and the Commission will continue, in close cooperation with the Presidency and the Member States, to bring up other individual cases at every level of its contacts with the Syrian administration."
"With regard to the Association Agreement negotiations, the Commission remains convinced that a human rights dialogue will be more effective in the framework of the contractual relations provided for in the Agreement."
"This Agreement, including the provisions on free trade, cooperation and political dialogue, and with the clause on human rights and democracy as crucial components, will be an important instrument for opening up Syrian society and for making it more democratic."
"As regards enhancing the MEDA programmes with the aim of supporting the development of a democratic society, the Commission, under the current national indicative programme with Syria, continues to have support for civil society as one of its priorities in the area of cooperation, and it hopes to continue along these lines thanks to future programmes."
"Since it has been mentioned several times, I will say a word about the Association Agreement."
"The Commission remains aware of the current political difficulties regarding the signing of the Agreement with Syria."
"By arranging the military withdrawal from Lebanon, Syria has taken a first positive step towards implementing Resolution 1559 of the United Nations Security Council."
"It is clear, however, that, owing to the current situation, that is to say the continued and visible presence of the Syrian secret service in Lebanon, as well as the lack of cooperation in Iraq, Syria absolutely must take strong and positive action in order to restore confidence and must do this before it considers any possible signing of the Agreement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few moments."
"The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, there is an oral amendment to recital E: when talking about ‘Riad al-Hamood, civil society activist’, it must be specified that ‘Kurdish’ precedes ‘civil society activist’."
"That concludes the voting, and we shall now proceed to the explanations of vote."
"The Moderate delegation has today voted in favour of a report on major and neglected diseases in the developing countries."
"We believe that disease and ill-health are dominant problems in these countries and that they are both causes and consequences of under-development."
"However, we have our doubts about the EU expressing views on the way in which the pharmaceutical industry prices different products."
"We also have our doubts about forcing the pharmaceutical industry to reinvest a portion of its profits in R[amp]D in relation to neglected diseases."
"We should prefer to encourage the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily and for ethical and moral reasons to decide to re-invest a portion of its profits in research into diseases affecting poor countries."
"This is in line with assuming responsibility for global development."
"What should also be drawn attention to are the African governments that deduct sales or import tax on antiretroviral and other medicines."
"This leads to medicines becoming unavailable to many impecunious groups."
"In those cases, the governments concerned must be strongly encouraged to abolish such taxes."
"The global fight against infectious diseases is a very important issue demanding extensive international commitment."
"The June List is of the view that international cooperation should be practised within already established organisations, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), with skills and experience in this area."
"The June List recommends limited EU cooperation."
"We are critical of a situation in which the EU seeks influence and powers in relation to issues already being dealt with by existing international organisations."
". As a result of the economic development and the improved quality of life in Europe, we have a number of responsibilities towards the rest of the international community."
"Whilst one may subscribe to a worldview that sees free trade as one of the main keys to development, one must also bear in mind that there are certain areas that cannot simply be left to the whims of the market. This is because, however global it may be, the market does not favour more worthwhile objectives."
"That is not to discredit the market, but to point out that, inevitably, it does have its limitations."
"In this context, we must not forget that certain diseases hamper the development of the world’s poorest countries. It is therefore essential that the EU’s development initiatives – the effectiveness of which is sometimes open to question – should involve combating these diseases, within the context of development aid as a whole."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 8 September 2005."
"The first thing we should do today is welcome our Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues;"
"I shall do so expressly in my speech to the House immediately following the adoption of the order of business."
"For the moment, I can just say to them: and."
"The next item is the adoption of the order of business for the present part-session and the October I part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 22 September pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of our Rules of Procedure."
"No amendments have been proposed."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, if my information is correct, that group alone – and not the Liberal Group, as I had been told at one point – requests that the debate on Tunisia be replaced by the issue of minorities in Voivodina."
"Mr Watson confirms that."
"All right, then it is just the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that has made the proposal."
"Furthermore, the Group of the Socialist Party in the European Parliament has requested that it be the debate on Uzbekistan that should be replaced by ‘Minorities in Voivodina’."
"Could you clarify this please, Mr Schulz?"
"Mr President, what you have just described is what came out of the Conference of Presidents and the subsequent discussions between the groups."
"A matter of minutes ago, though, in this House, Mr Watson, Mr Poettering and I had a brief discussion, and we agree that what we would recommend is that we consider Uzbekistan in the October part-session and now proceed to debate the situation in Vojvodina (), whilst adjourning discussion of Tunisia."
"In addition to Mr Cohn-Bendit, it would be good if everybody else could hear what we are discussing as well."
"All right, we are talking about replacing the issue of Uzbekistan with Voivodina, on the proposal of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament."
"Is the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats maintaining its proposal?"
"Mr President, our primary concern was to do a swap by taking Tunisia off the agenda and replacing it with Vojvodina, but, as we still see it as important that we should, in human rights matters such as these, achieve outcomes with which we can all agree, we propose to keep Tunisia on the agenda, while – as Mr Schulz said – debating Vojvodina instead of Uzbekistan."
"Uzbekistan will then be on the agenda for the next part-session, and we can be certain of getting a broad majority on that."
"Let me say, for the benefit of the members of my own group, that the reasoning behind our motion was that we would thus ensure that Vojvodina is dealt with this week."
"You are therefore withdrawing your proposal."
"No amendments have been proposed."
"If you will allow me, I would like to use the speech I am to make next as an opportunity formally to welcome our colleagues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must offer a very warm welcome today to the observers from Bulgaria and Romania, who are already seated in our Parliament."
"Their presence reminds us that, in May of last year, the fifth enlargement of the European Union was left incomplete while we waited for Romania and Bulgaria to complete their accession processes."
"It is also good to remember that our Parliament gave its assent to the Treaty of Accession with these countries, which is being ratified by the Member States, and I believe that we are all now expecting their accession actually to take place on the scheduled date, 1 January 2007."
"I am sure that we will all make every effort, that we will all do everything in our power, including Romania and Bulgaria, to make sure that this becomes a reality."
"I would like to say today to our new colleagues that we eagerly await their contributions to our debates, and we wish them every success in their parliamentary work."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, the arrival of our Bulgarian and Romanian colleagues comes at a particularly difficult time for the European Union."
"On a day-to-day level, the institutions are functioning normally, nothing out of the ordinary is happening in the Union’s everyday life; but the European project is suffering an identity crisis which we cannot ignore."
"According to some people whom we have heard over recent days, the European Union could do without a vision of its future, and it would be sufficient for the Union simply to improve the functioning of its markets and to carry on enlarging."
"For some people, that would be sufficient."
"I believe, however, that the problem is more profound."
"The problem relates to the political meaning of the European project and its geographical dimension."
"Today, both aspects, the political meaning and the geographical dimension, are faced with deadlock and the European Parliament must make an enormous effort in order to help resolve it."
"Our Institution must contribute in every possible way to resolving this situation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a little more than a year ago I explained to you the priorities for our parliamentary work."
"Believe me, it would have been difficult for us to imagine back then, in September of last year, what our current circumstances would be."
"It would have been difficult to imagine the situation we are in today."
"I therefore believe that we should review what has happened this year and reconsider our objectives for the parliamentary year ahead of us."
"Please allow me to ask you collectively which of the things we proposed a year ago have been achieved, and how we are going to approach the parliamentary year now beginning during this critical phase in European integration."
"Also a year ago, we were joined by new Members."
"A year ago we received our fellow Members from the 10 new Member States and at that point we asked ourselves, amidst the joy of reunification, whether we were going to be able to work together, to combine such different parliamentary cultures; whether we were going to be able to rise to the challenge, a challenge unique in the world, of working in twenty different languages, a number which still does not sufficiently reflect the Union’s linguistic diversity."
"I believe that one year later, an intense year in every respect, we can say that this challenge has been met and that the Union’s enlarged Parliament is operating satisfactorily."
"I would like to thank everybody for their contribution in this success."
"Also a year ago, I told you that I was determined to resolve the complex and sensitive issue of the Statute of Members."
"You will remember that everybody agreed that this was a priority, and I was very eager to try to find a solution to it."
"Well, today we can say: mission accomplished."
"Thanks to the invaluable contribution of the Luxembourg Presidency, in July the Council expressed its agreement with the text approved by Parliament, which I will sign next Wednesday."
"This agreement is very important to our institution, since the absence of such an agreement had been poisoning our public image for a long time."
"I would now like to point out to you that, with regard to our operational rules, we must set two objectives: the rules relating to parliamentary assistants and the reform of the financial regulation so that the Union can manage its resources more efficiently."
"There is broad consensus in this regard."
"Without prejudice to good management, the Union needs a financial regulation that enables it to operate more efficiently."
"We already have a draft that the Commission has communicated to us."
"I propose that we set the objective that this new financial regulation should enter into force together with the 2007 budget."
"A year ago too, we were preparing for the investiture of the new Commission and you will recall that that was a turbulent period."
"I believe we can say today, however, that the European Parliament has gained in maturity, legitimacy, credibility and public visibility, and also that our cooperation with the Commission rests upon solid foundations."
"Following that rocky investiture, we negotiated a framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission."
"That agreement enables us to make considerable progress in the field of information and democratic control."
"I am pleased about that too."
"In application of the agreement, the Conference of Presidents will receive Mr Barroso in two days’ time to hear about the proposals that the Commission has announced for this year directly from him."
"A year ago too the tragic fate of the Beslan hostages overshadowed our plenary session."
"At that time I insisted on the need to push ahead with the European area of security and justice, by actively promoting an anti-terrorist strategy."
"A year on, however, and the barbarism of the terrorists is continuing."
"London has been the latest victim on European soil, but Iraq is a victim every day."
"Today the terrorist threat is greater and it will not disappear for the time being."
"It will test European society’s capacity to tackle it while respecting our democratic values."
"The balance between freedom and security will therefore be a permanent element in our debate."
"It was during the last part-session, when we heard Minister Clarke, and it will continue to be so in the future."
"Furthermore, we are all aware that terrorism blurs the distinction between internal affairs and external policy and that today, whether we like it or not, it appears to be directly related to immigration problems."
"We must therefore combat terrorism together with our neighbours and partners in the Islamic world, in particular in the Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to pause here for a moment to tell you that one of the great issues for the future of the European Union is its relationship with the Muslim world."
"Perhaps the most important issue."
"I propose that we make use of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, which is now being chaired by the European Parliament, to develop this relationship in a positive manner, preventing the terrorist threat and the tensions created by immigration from leading to the Islamophobia that the terrorists would see as their greatest success."
"A year ago I also spoke to you about two issues that were fundamental at that time and which today are even more important."
"I am referring, as you know, to the Constitutional Treaty and the financial perspective."
"In both cases, Parliament has done what we proposed doing."
"With regard to the Constitutional Treaty, we hosted a great debate that ended with majority support for the Treaty."
"Thirteen countries have ratified it, but the French and Dutch noes have led the Council, as you know, to establish a period of reflection, to which I will refer in a moment."
"With regard to the financial perspective, we have been able to draw up an ambitious and reasonable report by means of an ad hoc committee that enabled us to coordinate all the relevant points of view."
"As a result, our Parliament has a position of its own on the basis of which it can analyse those of the other institutions."
"We know what we want and we have said it."
"With regard to our position, we must assess those of the Commission, which we also know, and those of the Council, which we are awaiting, because the Council has not been able to reach an agreement."
"I very much fear that that was not due to the problems of the Constitution, but to a worrying lack of Community spirit and an increasing devaluation of the idea of European solidarity."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have come this far by following this path."
"What more must we do from now on and how must we do it?"
"In my view, the most urgent and most important thing – at least the most urgent – is the financial perspective."
"It would be good to remember that an agreement in the Council is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition if the Union is to have this multi-annual financial framework."
"I have said this to members of the Council on several occasions: an agreement amongst you will be of no use unless it is acceptable to Parliament, because this is an interinstitutional agreement which involves the three Institutions."
"I would take this opportunity to urge the Council to do its duty and to reach an agreement during the UK Presidency, because afterwards it will be too late, or much more complicated."
"From the brilliant speech with which it began its term in office, it appeared that the UK Presidency had ideas for achieving an agreement on a better structure for Community spending."
"The European Parliament would point out that it is urgent to turn these ideas into reality."
"In the meantime, we must continue to work on the legislative programmes."
"I am aware that drawing up these programmes without knowing what resources are allocated to each spending programme complicates our work, but it does not make it impossible."
"I must inform you that the Commission and the Council have insisted that we continue to work on these legislative programmes, because they are essential to the implementation of the 2007 budget."
"Over the coming days, the Conference of Presidents will have to decide how to do it and call upon the competent committees to act in a coordinated fashion in accordance with their guidelines."
"Ladies and gentlemen – if I may speak more formally for a moment, while the British Prime Minister is here, and I thank him for his dedication to Parliament – the Union needs the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"However, something that it needs even more than that, something that is essential to the Union, is a budget that can be implemented from 1 January 2007."
"Not to have one would be a serious problem."
"From now on, therefore, we must anticipate the possibility that we may have to begin to draw up the 2007 annual budget before there is an agreement on the financial perspective."
"That possibility exists."
"From now on I would like to assure you that Parliament will do its duty, as laid down in the Treaties, in order to guarantee that, with or without a financial perspective, the Union has a budget that can be implemented for 2007."
"It would be a novel situation, but if it arose we should face it in our proper democratic fashion."
"Then we have the other great fundamental issue: the future of the Union and its relationship with the Constitutional Treaty."
"As you know, the Council has agreed to a period of reflection until next spring; and that is what it is, a period of reflection."
"It is not a pause, a word which you will note does not appear anywhere in the Council’s conclusions."
"It did, but it is not in the final conclusions."
"In fact, other countries have continued their ratification processes since that Council, including, by referendum, Luxembourg."
"It is clear, however, that, while we reflect, for some time we are going to carry on working with what we have: the Treaty of Nice."
"There is no crisis of day-to-day operation."
"There is no legal vacuum."
"That is an obvious thing to say, but in politics it sometimes makes sense to state the obvious."
"There is good reason for pointing this out because I am going on to say that the future problems that the Constitutional Treaty was intended to resolve remain."
"Those problems are still there."
"Resolving the Union’s institutional problems is not a merely cosmetic issue."
"We need institutions that are appropriately designed so that they operate effectively."
"Everybody can now see that there was, and there remains, no plan B as an alternative to the Constitutional Treaty."
"There is no plan B, but amongst all of us we have coined a plan D: ‘D’ for democracy and debate."
"It is precisely democracy and debate that define the essence of a Parliament."
"This Parliament, therefore, in which the last great democratic debate on the Union took place with speeches by Mr Juncker and Mr Blair, this Parliament which witnessed that great moment of parliamentary democracy, must continue in this direction and – why not? – urge the Heads of State or Government of the countries in which the results of the referenda were particularly significant to continue that debate which was started so brilliantly."
"Furthermore, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is in the process of drawing up a report on this period of reflection and will subsequently present its proposals to us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will remember that a year ago I believed that the ratifications were going to be a decisive time for talking to the Europeans about Europe."
"A great opportunity to talk to the Europeans about Europe, I said, but the truth is that I never thought that it would be an opportunity to talk to the Europeans about Europe."
"After what has happened, we must promote a great conversation amongst Europeans throughout Europe, a decentralised conversation of course, in cooperation with the national Parliaments of course, but also involving the views of the whole of civil society."
"We have enough time."
"Let us do it, perhaps less passionately than during the referendum campaigns, but with more and better information."
"I have just received a letter from President Barroso, and I have held working meetings with the Vice-President, who is here at the moment, in which he proposes that we work together in this field."
"We are going to do so, of course, both with the Commission and with the Council, because we are all convinced that the Europe we are going to construct will be neither technocratic nor bureaucratic and Parliament must therefore fully demonstrate its ."
"Please allow me now to return to our legislative work."
"I believe that our results are positive."
"We must, however, place more emphasis on the added value that Europe offers the Europeans and we will have the opportunity to do so when we debate the REACH Directive – the type of directive, incidentally, that the Commission says it will never again send – and the directives on services, working time, air safety and railways."
"Then there are security and justice matters, and also Turkey, because a year ago we proposed giving our opinion on Turkey."
"We did so."
"Our position had a definite political impact."
"This Wednesday we will once again study the situation on the eve of the start of the negotiations."
"We are undoubtedly at an historic moment, and Parliament will have to give its opinion on the Protocol to the EU-Turkey Association Agreement, which has led to the problems of which we are all aware and which the UK Presidency is working to resolve."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this Parliament has an essential role to play in terms of defining the balance between liberty and security in the fight against terrorism."
"If Europe has to have an anti-terrorist policy that redefines the relationship between freedom and security, this Parliament must be fully involved."
"That was laid down in the Constitutional Treaty, with significant advances in terms of our Parliament’s role in this field."
"Without a Constitutional Treaty, however, it is a positive sign that at the last informal Council of Home Affairs Ministers, the Council and the Commission agreed that Parliament should participate fully in the definition of this balance."
"If that is the case, and I hope that it is, I believe that it would be an excellent demonstration of cooperation amongst the three Institutions and the best way to define an anti-terrorist policy that is fully accepted by European society."
"I would like finally to refer to the issue of quality and the relevance of European legislation."
"What legislation we produce, its quality, the issues it deals with, its relevance, how good it is: ‘better regulation’ is a fashionable issue."
"It is not a new issue: every Commission states that it wants to simplify the ."
"I believe that this is the third time, at least, that a Commission has said that that is what is going to happen."
"As far as the present situation is concerned, the President of the Commission has recently stated that he intends to withdraw several dozen legislative proposals."
"From a procedural point of view, I have reminded the Commission of its obligation, according to our Framework Agreement, to inform Parliament before withdrawing those proposals and to do so without treating this obligation to inform merely as a meaningless formality."
"We do not yet know which texts they are – I am sure that President Barroso will tell us – but I must point out right now that, depending on the stage they are at in their passage through the Council and Parliament, their withdrawal could raise legal problems, which Parliament would like to resolve in a positive fashion."
"That is what I have to say with regard to procedure."
"With regard to content, it is true that the European Union sometimes deals with many issues in great detail."
"As well as trying not to legislate in excessive detail, however, it would also be good to consider the question of whether the European building is not lacking certain main beams that are needed to ensure the solidity of the whole structure."
"There is no question that measures are needed to simplify legislation, to assess its impact and to analyse how texts are transposed."
"I am told, for example, that there are currently 56 directives regulating the labelling of products."
"If it is true that there are 56 directives regulating the labelling of products in Europe, then that batch of legislation should be consolidated."
"In that respect, the UK Presidency has called an extraordinary Summit for the end of October, at which I will have the honour of representing our Institution, whose participation has been increasing, and I believe that that is something we should be pleased about."
"We do not yet know the agenda for that Summit, but there is no doubt that the issue of the famous European social model will be one of the main issues being debated."
"That social model, which for some people does not exist and for others takes many forms, is a priority issue for our debate, because it represents no less than the debate on European society’s response to economic globalisation."
"This is absolutely fundamental to the future of our society."
"The work of our committees will be very important for that, as will the debate that we will hold in plenary in the presence of the British Prime Minister, who will come here to hold a debate with Parliament on the eve of the Summit."
"Furthermore, I must tell you that throughout all my journeys this year I have noticed that the Union’s foreign policy has ceased to be exclusively the domain of the governments; that on all my trips to non-EU countries I have noted that parliamentary diplomacy is increasing in maturity and responsibility, in particular thanks to the excellent cooperation with the Council and the Commission."
"I must also tell you that everywhere I go I am told that Europe is needed and I often hear the complaint that its presence is insufficient."
"Perhaps non-Europeans feel the need for Europe more than we do ourselves."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when analysing the democracy that was emerging in the United States, a democracy like the one we intend to create, a supranational democracy, Alexis de Tocqueville said that nations, like men, only reach a greater destiny through dialogue and political debate."
"I would like to urge you to bring this spirit alive in the debate on the future of Europe, in our respective States and in the European Institutions."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by extending, on behalf of our group, a warm welcome to our friends from Bulgaria and Romania and to assure them that we look forward to what will be a process of mutual learning."
"Those of us who are already in this House will have a lot to learn from Bulgaria and Romania on how matters progress on those fronts, while they, our new observers, will have much to learn from the way we work."
"An understanding attitude on the part of both sides will bring us successes in which we can all share."
"You, Mr President, made reference to an identity crisis, and I welcome the opportunity that your speech gives us to take inventory today."
"You also made reference to the Constitution."
"I am convinced in the depths of my being that the only way we can respond to this identity crisis in which we in Europe find ourselves is if we succeed in expressing the values that unite us – even across party political boundary lines – in the shape of European constitutional law."
"It is for that reason that our Constitution – and I am thinking particularly of its second part in which these values are described – must not be set aside, but must remain on the agenda, for the fact is that we need these values, and it is on them that our common future depends."
"It is for that reason that the negative response from France and the Netherlands must not be allowed to be the last word."
"We must of course set the right timeframe and be discriminating in deciding when to move forward, and so we need to join with the Commission in considering this."
"Neither of us must allow the impression to be given that the Constitution is in some sense no longer on the agenda; even now, we are giving thought to how to give tangible form to this Constitution and its essential elements."
"I also think it would be a good idea – and I believe that the President is thinking along similar lines – if we were, from time to time, irrespective of which country currently holds the presidency of the European Union, to invite to this House Heads of Government for the purpose of engaging with them in a debate on the future of Europe."
"We are of course perturbed to learn that many members of the public regard this Europe of ours as a very distant thing."
"There is no doubt, Vice-President Wallström, that this is in part a public relations matter, and, as such, one of your responsibilities, but it is in essence about the legislative work that we do, and so let me say on behalf of our group that the Commission’s approach – that we make fewer laws – is, in principle, the right one."
"What we do, though, must be good; it must be ‘better lawmaking’."
"The Commission is approaching things from the right angle, but I urge you not to circumvent the procedures agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, for that is to go down a blind alley."
"While we can go along with the substance of what you want, I very strongly recommend that you stick to the procedures for consultation with the European Parliament before you pass formal resolutions."
"If you want to come to a decision as early as this coming Tuesday, it is not enough that Commissioner Verheugen – and I have no idea why it should be him – should unofficially inform the groups today; what is needed instead is constructive institutional exchange between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"One of the most important matters to be considered will be, no doubt, the competitiveness of Europe."
"We agree with Mr Barroso that the debate on the Constitution must not be allowed to distract us from this issue, which, along with the question of how we construct a social Europe, is at the heart of everything."
"We also need to engage in closer dialogue with the parliaments at the national level, for division between us and them would be a tragedy for the European Union."
"If we want to lead the European Union into a bright future, we will have to seek ways of doing so together."
"I would also like – and with this I shall close, not least because I see that the Deputy Prime Minister is here in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council – to address the issue of how we should proceed as regards data and the combating of terrorism."
"We have heard that there are governments that want to deal with this only by enacting framework resolutions, which amounts to excluding the European Parliament."
"The British Home Secretary, Mr Clarke, has said that the UK Presidency of the Council is prepared to involve this House if we manage to come up with something definite within a reasonable period of time."
"Speaking on behalf of our group, I can tell him that that is what we want to do, as terrorism needs to be combated."
"I can assure you of that."
"We also, however, want Parliament involved in order that there may be a proper legislative framework, and in order that it is not brought into being by the national governments alone."
"It is with this in mind that I hope that the Council, the Commission and we in this Parliament will work together well, for if we do not, this European Union will find itself in still greater difficulties."
"We are working together for the future of the European Union, and it is a matter of shared obligation that we do so."
". Mr President, many thanks for what you said about the general direction of our work over the coming year."
"I extend a warm welcome to our friends from Romania and Bulgaria, no matter what their political allegiance: a particularly warm welcome to those who belong to my own group, but a welcome nonetheless to those of differing views, coupled with the hope that we will work well together in this House for the good of the European Union."
"What I also ask of them is that they work hard and debate hard in this House, for the European Union has need of that too."
"It is in this Parliament that European democracy happens, so let me pick up what my good friend Mr Poettering said."
"I do indeed share his view that we cannot accept the Commission’s way of passing information around, which involves it, through the medium of Commissioner Verheugen, telling the what it wants to withdraw, followed by Mr Barroso, the following day, telling the international press what he is withdrawing, so that Parliament has, to this day, not been officially informed, even though the Commission is obliged to do so by the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Parliament is surely entitled, though, to know what is going on in the secret corridors of power in this building."
"One opportunity to tell it would have been last Thursday in the Conference of Presidents, when Mr Barroso could have done the job."
"He was, of course, invited, but said he could not be there."
"I was then told that the reason why he would not be there was that Mr Poettering was not there."
"Well, I said, there you go: if Mr Poettering is not there, then there is no point!"
"Looking at the newspapers today, I now learn where Mr Barroso was last Thursday, when his absence was unavoidable."
"The Chairman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats may well get worked up about our not being informed, but we could have been last Thursday, had not Mr Poettering, together with President Barroso, been attending an event in Lisbon staged by the European People’s Party’s think-tanks."
"You should not go complaining to the Commission if it is you yourself who ensure that the appointments intended for us to be informed cannot be kept."
"I am not aiming these remarks at Mr Poettering, for that is not his job."
"I have some sympathy for him, but none for the President of the Commission."
"Commissioner Wallström, you can tell Mr Barroso from me that I will not accept a situation in which the President of the Commission tells the international press what he intends to do, but not the European Parliament."
"That is unacceptable!"
"Nor can I see it as acceptable that a President of the Commission, should, in a press conference on the occasion of his return from holiday – which must have been a long one, for I have heard nothing from him for a long time – say that there was no point in concentrating on the Constitution, which was going to be a long time coming anyway, and that now was the time for us to focus on something else: that from someone whose task it is to contend for this same Constitution!"
"I really do wonder what the President of the Commission’s attitude is towards those states that actually have ratified the Constitution, or towards those currently in the process of doing so."
"What are they, faced with a Commission President such as this one, actually meant to think?"
"I have no quibble with the substance of this; it is indeed the case that we have to make a better job of making laws, and that superfluous ones need to be withdrawn."
"With that I wholeheartedly agree, but let me make it abundantly clear, Mr President, that the work programme you have announced for the coming year cannot be gone through in the same way as its predecessors."
"It is all about cooperation between the European institutions, between the Commission and Parliament in particular, but what I then expect of the Commission is that it should meet Parliament halfway and make Parliament – rather than a press conference or the Commission’s briefings in Brussels – the venue for debate about the future of Europe."
"That is the only way that we will reach any sort of agreement, not least on the Financial Perspective."
"Let me just remind you that, between Parliament’s figures – our proposals, in other words – and those that the Summit failed to adopt, by which I mean the 1.07% compromise that was on the table there, there is a gulf of several billions, but between the demands the Commission makes on the Financial Perspective and what the Council actually wants there is a yawning chasm amounting to double that amount again."
"Any President of the Commission who wanted to implement his own ambitious programme ought, after the failure of the Financial Perspective, to have made a scene about it and denounced it as a road to ruin for the European Union!"
"What I am criticising, Mr President, is the Commission’s far too lengthy absence from the debate on the Financial Perspective and the Constitution."
"While wholeheartedly endorsing your proposals, we also hope that the Commission – and its President in particular – will soon get back on the playing field."
". Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I would like to welcome President-in-Office Prescott, clearly keener to enjoy the company of former colleagues than to join his party's bean feast in Brighton."
"I, too, welcome our new friends from Romania and Bulgaria."
"I am sorry that they join us at a less than happy time."
"Europe is in the doldrums: its Constitution has suffered a setback, its budget in stalemate, its economy stagnating."
"It seeks a fresh breeze to lift its sails."
"Previously, Parliaments looked to the Commission to take the lead: as the guardian of the Treaties; as the motor of integration, the initiator of ideas."
"This Parliament must challenge the Member States."
"Is Germany ready to reform?"
"Will Italy deal with its deficit?"
"Will Tony Blair back up his fine words with full British participation in Europe's projects?"
"And will Paris and The Hague show leadership of their people?"
"Now more than ever, Parliament and Commission must work together to rescue the European project, to unite the Union."
"Five years ago in Lisbon, the Member States agreed an agenda."
"Five months ago in Brussels, the Commission set out a new strategy for jobs and growth."
"How many weeks must we wait for consensus in the Council, and when we reach consensus, for the courage to carry it through?"
"We have read of a bonfire of regulations, doubtless long overdue."
"But permit me a word on process."
"Better enforcement of laws: that is for the Commission and the Court."
"Fewer, more focused new laws: that is for the Commission, too."
"But decisions to scrap directives and to improve scrappy directives are a process involving Parliament, and we expect a say in withdrawing or re-writing laws."
"Commissioner Wallström, our involvement is your accountability."
"Our approval is your legitimacy."
"I fear you will not agree the budget under Britain's Presidency."
"But use your public tour of Europe, together with Mr Barroso, to get agreement in national capitals for the financing the Union needs."
"We need more champions like Airbus."
"We will not have those with a cap of 1%."
"We need to invest in upskilling; to provide for lifelong learning; to boost research and development – no way on 1%."
"Commissioner Wallström, do now the tour you should have done in June."
"Set the agenda or the Member States will set it for you."
"Europe's Constitution bears fine signatures of presidents and prime ministers."
"Yet some of our citizens declined to sign it off."
"Arguably the recipe is not quite right."
"Possibly, people suspect it was signed in bad faith."
"Certainly its signatories show precious little respect for the institutions they have established."
"For the present, it is in cold storage."
"So, yes, Mr Barroso, let us get the politics right, and getting them right probably means getting them centre."
"But, where the Constitution is concerned, do not rush to perform the burial rites."
"To paraphrase Mark Twain, rumours of its death may be exaggerated."
"Let us use this period of reflection to call Chirac and Balkenende before this House to tell us how they propose to proceed; hold hearings with those who have not yet ratified; confront the Member States with their responsibilities."
"Together, let us show that our Union meets the needs of its people: enhancing security without threatening liberty; building the foundation for jobs without undermining solidarity; gaining EU added value without diminishing identity."
"If this is our agenda, some time from now our institutions and our institutional plans should once again command from our citizens the support and dedication they deserve."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen from Romania and Bulgaria, everybody has warmly welcomed you, our group warmly welcomes you and, as you can see, you have arrived at just the right time."
"Your situation is, in fact, peculiar."
"This Parliament is clearly furious, or at any rate is if we are to believe the group chairmen who have voiced their opinion against the Commission, against such and such a person."
"Mr Borrell, you said that the moment Mr Blair spoke in this House was a great moment for democracy."
"What happened?"
"He gave a speech, he left and since then the Presidency has gone quiet."
"‘They’ no longer exist at all, we do not know what ‘they’ do: this is not a great moment for democracy."
"We are not talking here about the French Presidency; for the time being, we have a UK Presidency."
"There is a UK Presidency, it should preside over matters and it is not doing so."
"We are therefore entitled, as Parliament, to point out that it is doing nothing."
"That is the least a Parliament can do."
"Full stop."
"I would like, at this point, to make a very simple remark."
"If Mr Barroso thinks this or that about the Constitution, let him come and say so to Parliament."
"We will debate it with him and we will give him a dressing-down."
"Let him come and speak about the Constitution to Parliament."
"If Mr Barroso believes that laws exist that should be withdrawn, let him come and say so!"
"Moreover, on this issue, Mr Poettering, you cannot say that, as regards the content, you agree with Mr Barroso: we do not know what Mr Barroso wants."
"You can say that, as regards the format, you agree, but personally speaking, as regards the content, I do not know what the Commission wants to do."
"With regard to better regulation, let us take the example of Mrs Reding, who wants to create European television, television in the style of Mr Berlusconi, with advertising everywhere."
"Is that better regulation?"
"No, it is worse regulation and we do not want it."
"We know what its content is."
"Let Mrs Reding come and propose her new directive on television, and you will see that what the Commission wants will never gain majority support in this House."
"Matters are therefore very straightforward."
"The Commission makes proposals and formulates ideas."
"It goes into recess, it asks itself some serious questions, it returns and it formulates ideas."
"Let it come to Parliament to present its ideas."
"When we have a directive, we put it to the vote: it is accepted or it is not accepted."
"When we want to withdraw a directive, we vote on the proposal: it is accepted or it is not accepted."
"We take things one by one and whether it is a question of better regulation, of neoliberal regulation, of socialist regulation or of no regulation at all, what matters is the content."
"I have had enough of those people who continually make proposals in the European area without knowing whom to address themselves to."
"We want a Commission that is a Commission proposing European laws."
"We want a Parliament."
"We want a Council that looks after its affairs. When there is a Presidency, let it preside over matters without other distractions."
"If Mr Blair likes to play cricket and drink tea, then that is his choice but, as President, he has other matters to attend to."
"He has to make proposals so that Europe moves forward and, for the time being, Europe is not moving forward, and it is because of this Presidency."
". Mr President, Mr Prescott, Mrs Wallström, together with my group, I gladly endorse all the words of welcome that have just been addressed to the observers from Romania and Bulgaria."
"If we do not want our words of welcome to be mere lip service, however, we must have the courage to accept all the implications of our choices."
"The now fast-approaching prospect for which my group has, moreover, given its full support - of these two countries entering the European Union in fact only makes a genuine change in direction for the EU’s economic, monetary, budgetary, fiscal and trade policy all the more urgent and decisive."
"With 15 Member States, this was necessary; with 25 or 27 Member States, this becomes essential."
"Mr President, you have spoken of an identity crisis."
"I believe you are right."
"To overcome it, political choices have to take precedence over market requirements, because if, in the name of international competition, we are content with adapting ourselves to globalisation as it is today, then there is quite simply no room either for social issues or for solidarity."
"With the mass unemployment, rapid growth in job insecurity, large-scale poverty and glaring inequalities that we are experiencing, it would be politically irresponsible and socially explosive to remain with set ideas about free competition, restrictions on public spending, social and fiscal dumping and, the icing on the cake, miserly budgets."
"As the elected representatives of our fellow citizens, we have a duty to bear witness to the profound uneasiness that, in one form or another, is being expressed throughout the whole of Europe."
"What can Parliament undertake to do in the coming months to send out to Europeans the positive signals they are waiting for?"
"I would put forward three proposals."
"Firstly, we are going to be judged on our votes on a whole range of draft directives."
"As of this week, the one aimed at totally liberalising rail transport and, in the next few weeks, the deeply symbolic Bolkestein Directive, which Mr Barroso has been very careful not to throw out with the others."
"These will be followed by the texts on regional transport, port services and working time, without forgetting the opinions that we will have to provide on the negotiations at the WTO and, in particular, on the General Agreement on Trade in Services."
"If we want to satisfy expectations, we would be wise, in each case, to adopt a clearly anti-liberal and very demanding stance on public services."
"Secondly, we should take a number of significant political initiatives on major issues of civilisation."
"One single example: war and peace."
"In order to express our rejection of war, and particularly of the involvement of EU countries in such a venture, let us invite to Parliament Mrs Cindy Sheehan, the mother of a US soldier killed in Iraq, whose cry of pain, truth and humanity is moving opinion on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Thirdly and finally, and in conjunction with the first two areas, let us contribute to giving our fellow citizens their freedom of speech."
"Let us organise debates by all means, but let us make them genuine, uncensored debates in the 27 Member States of the enlarged Union on what ought to change in the Union in order to breathe life back into the European dream."
". Mr President, I welcome our friends from Bulgaria and Romania."
"They will be warmly received by this ever-expanding European empire."
"I would say this to them: although you are not elected, you will be treated as full members of the European political elite."
"You will be entitled to the very generous daily allowance; you will find the chauffeur service at your disposal; there will be an endless round of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and drinks receptions."
"After all that, with your expanded waistlines, the plan is that you go back to your home countries and tell people that all is well with this club that you have agreed to join."
"As Marx said – and I mean Groucho Marx, not Karl Marx – 'I wouldn't join any club that would have me as a member'."
"As far as the EU is concerned that is pretty sound advice, because this is a club whose accounts have not been signed off for the last ten years."
"This is a club, as you heard from the group leaders earlier, that is treating the voters of France and the Netherlands with absolute contempt as it tries to impose the provisions of a Constitution that should be dead."
"It is a club that will take away your very rights to govern yourselves and, sadly, is increasingly beginning to resemble the very political system from which you have just escaped."
"You will hear barracking from those who live on this European Union and who earn far more here than they would ever be worth in the commercial world."
"You are here as observers, so just have a look around."
"What are we doing here today?"
"What a nonsense that we are spending EUR 200 million a year of taxpayers' money on the monthly jaunt to Strasbourg."
"Have a look tomorrow and on Wednesday and Thursday at the absolutely farcical voting system here and realise that whatever Mr Barroso said last week about deregulation, less regulation and the sixty legislative acts they intend to withdraw, there have been some 2 000 legislative instruments passed in the short period since 1 July, when the British took over the Presidency of the Council."
"Please look and go back and tell your people the truth."
"The ten Member States that joined last year all had referendums in their countries."
"I understand there is no intention to hold referendums in Romania and Bulgaria."
"Do not those people deserve the chance at least to vote in a referendum and have a debate?"
"Would it not be a huge, historic mistake to railroad those people into this failing European Union without first telling them the truth?"
"The British people were lied to 30 years ago about this European club."
"Your people deserve better than that."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Deputy Prime Minister Prescott and Commissioner Wallström for their presence here today."
"I would also like to thank Mr Cohn-Bendit for devoting so much attention to me, as always."
"What we have seen here today is the ability of an institution such as ours to raise our voices in grave concern and yet come up with no solution."
"Because, ultimately, if we really want to respond to what is occurring in the European Union of today, we must first recognise that, whatever crisis we may perceive, the people out there do not see it as a crisis."
"For 90% of the people, the European Union does not represent a positive image of relevance to them."
"It is seen as being interfering, over-burdensome, over-arching and, indeed, uncaring when it comes people's everyday concerns."
"It is important to be realistic when we consider the number of issues that our organisation can address within its rules. I heard talk here today of how wrong it was of President Barroso to mention that the Commission was going to drop 'x' number of directives, or that it was going to reduce the number of directives in force."
"The President of our own Parliament said here today that there are 56 different directives dealing with the sale and production of goods for supply and for services."
"There are 16 individual directives dealing with the purchase, marketing and presentation of fertiliser for sale."
"Surely, they can all be brought into a single directive."
"Maybe there is a difference in language and interpretation and that what the President of the Commission meant to say was consolidation, or codification, which happens in every single government."
"There is no reason why every single institution should not take a hard look at itself to determine what the most important issues to be tackled are and how legislation can be improved and made more relevant to the people."
"The challenges facing us today are not about the distant future, or even the failed ideologies of the past."
"The challenges for us today are to ensure that we can create a proper structure for Europe in the 21st century."
"Funding is a core issue and there must be agreement on the financial perspective."
"Member States must make a payment towards the central budget to ensure that we can assist those countries most in need, and to ensure that we can continue to drive forward Europe as a dynamic, innovative and creative centre."
"We must also try to ensure that, in so doing, we do not throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"There have been those who in the recent past have sought to link the common agricultural policy to the financial perspective."
"That was a mistake and it is to be hoped that there will now be a retreat from that position."
"Likewise it is important that we in this Parliament view our role responsibly and that, when we do not like or agree with legislation, we do not flunk the decision – as we did with the computer-implemented inventions directive, as we are trying to do with the services directive, and as we have done with many other proposed directives in the past."
"Our role as legislators is to legislate."
"That requires tough decisions."
"That means that there will be differences between us in this House."
"Those differences are not of a personal nature, but in what we see as the best vision for the future."
"Finally, when we speak about an area of freedom, security and justice, it is justice which must be first and foremost among those aims and ideals, because, unless we can guarantee people that their individual rights and freedoms are protected, then we will have failed in our first duty as legislators, namely, to ensure that the laws that we pass not only protect the common good, but do not adversely affect the minority."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last but not least I would like to take my turn in welcoming our new colleagues from Romania and Bulgaria."
"They will, I hope, restore to the French language and culture a little of the lustre it has lost here as successive enlargements have taken place, in particular with the accession of countries from Northern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe."
"I am not forgetting notable exceptions such as our late fellow Member from Poland, Filip Adwent."
"I welcome, in particular, our five colleagues and friends from the Romania Mare party in the great country of Romania and our Bulgarian colleague from the Attack party."
"They have come as observers to the European Parliament at a time when Turkey, on 3 October 2005, will be starting its accession talks, even though its accession was one of the reasons why the Constitution was rejected, and without it having acknowledged the Republic of Cyprus and, furthermore, without it wanting to do so."
"I believe that, with 10% of its population of Turkish origin, Bulgaria is particularly sensitive to this major event."
"May our colleagues know that they can count on our support in the European Parliament to defend the Europe of our native lands in the face of destructive globalisation and the flood of migrants."
"I note with interest the death knell that Mr Barroso, President of the European Commission, has just sounded to the defunct European Constitution."
"As a rational democrat, he has learned lessons from the French and Dutch referenda and scrapped this freedom-annihilating text."
"For once, law comes close to morality."
"The people’s opinion is superior to that of the technocrats, in spite of the various kinds of pressure being exerted by the great professional consciences."
"As regards the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the Franco-British battle over the rebate and the CAP budget is in danger of continuing unless the Community budget is increased beyond 1% of GDP to meet the needs of the CEECs."
"On that issue, we will denounce any withdrawal or climb-down from Mr Chirac and the French Government regarding the CAP."
"As loyal allies of the Americans, the British have but two objectives during their six-month Presidency: to get Turkey’s accession under way and to ensure that the much-vaunted ‘Bolkestein’ Directive on services is adopted."
"We will oppose them both."
"Mr Chirac addressed the European Commission, quite shamelessly, to request its intervention in the Hewlett Packard affair, with its 1 240 compulsory redundancies."
"He publicly humiliated himself and France along with him."
"It is not up to the Commission, in fact, to intervene in the internal management of businesses."
"It is only natural that methods of protecting French economic and social interests should be decided in Paris and not in Brussels and Geneva."
"Only the 2007 French presidential election, coming in the wake of the bombshell events of 29 May 2005, will mark the genuine break with Euro-internationalism and the spirit of renunciation."
"It is a break that all genuine Europeans are waiting for."
"This will be the return to national ideas and to economic patriotism in the service of the people."
"Having the formidable privilege of precedence, I believe I can be the most convincing spokesperson on this matter in France and in Europe."
"."
"Mr President, let me begin by joining President Borrell and others who have welcomed our friends from Bulgaria and Romania as observers."
"This will be a very important step towards helping the final preparations for membership."
"The Commission will continue to actively assist your efforts and we look forward to working with you."
"Let me also add that I have followed the reports about the floods and their effects in your countries during the summer."
"I hope you are aware of the solidarity we feel and know that we will respond to any requests for assistance you may have."
"I wish to make two comments, firstly on the Constitution, because it is important for everybody to see the role of the Commission in this matter."
"From the very beginning, the Commission not only supported the Constitution, but was also actively involved in the work of the Convention."
"This was discussed every week at the Commission."
"We continue to support the Constitution."
"We all agree that it might not be a perfect document, but we support it and we have worked actively on it."
"After the negative referendums in France and the Netherlands, we all know it is unlikely that the Constitution will be ratified by all Member States in the foreseeable future."
"That does not mean that we will not continue to work actively on the political agenda in order to deliver concrete results for the citizens of Europe."
"The Commission will continue to ensure that we work on our political priorities and deliver on them."
"We must also use this period of reflection to engage in a dialogue with citizens."
"This is the only way to ensure that we can gain their full support for a new Constitution."
"We want to find a common understanding with Member States on the way forward, with the help of the European Parliament."
"That is why even before the summer we started to draw up what we call 'Plan D' for debate, dialogue and democracy."
"At our seminar last week, we discussed a number of very concrete ideas on how we could engage in that kind of dialogue with Member States."
"It has to be a very broad agenda aimed at continuing the dialogue beyond the lifetime of the current Commission or Parliament."
"This is not only a rescue operation for the Constitution, but must also be a new way of engaging with citizens."
"President Barroso and I will present our preliminary ideas on this Plan D to the Conference of Presidents on Wednesday."
"A communication to the Council and Parliament is also being prepared and I hope that a formal version of this will be ready later this week to give you an opportunity to react to it."
"Last week President Barroso sent a letter to President Borrell proposing that we identify initiatives where the Commission and Parliament could cooperate and also that our respective services meet as soon as possible to discuss such initiatives."
"The best way to overcome the current crisis is to convince Europeans of the relevance of Europe."
"Therefore, our primary concern is to deliver on our policy priorities."
"Our objectives of prosperity, solidarity and security are still valid and indeed are more relevant than ever."
"They are in tune with what people in Europe want when we ask them through the Euro-barometer polls – more and better jobs; preserving social and territorial cohesion; managing the earth's resources in a sustainable way; and reinforcing security in Europe and the world as a whole."
"Secondly, on the subject of better regulation, I first of all want to thank Parliament for its cooperation on the signing of a new framework agreement."
"Since this is my responsibility, I will be taking great care to make sure that we abide by the framework agreement."
"That is why I have studied the events which prompted criticism and unease on the part of Members of Parliament over the question of better regulation."
"Better regulation has been on the agenda of our institutions for a long time."
"Since 2003, we have been working together on better law-making."
"An interinstitutional agreement was signed that year, aimed at simplifying and improving Community regulation."
"This Commission made a renewed and strong commitment to better regulation at the beginning of its mandate, and better regulation at all levels has also become a central plank of the revised Lisbon Strategy."
"My colleague, Mr Verheugen, has kept this House regularly informed about the Commission's approach and, having looked at the calendar, I see that there have been at least ten occasions, including the preliminary hearings, on which this House has been informed about the agenda on better regulation, in addition to the general information provided in interviews and on other occasions."
"It is a three-pillar approach which includes: screening of pending legislation with a view to withdrawing proposals which do not meet the criteria; the simplification exercise; and the upgrading of methods for preparing new legislative proposals, including impact assessments."
"Tomorrow, the Commission will discuss and endorse the results of the screening exercise and put forward the list of legislative proposals it considers should be withdrawn."
"It is the first time that the whole college has had the opportunity to decide on that."
"It has been a thorough and extensive exercise and we propose to withdraw about one-third of the 183 pending proposals."
"This will be done in full respect of the relevant provisions of the revised framework agreement."
"Pursuant to Article 12 of the framework agreement, Commissioner Verheugen will submit our proposal to Parliament before it is made public – it will be presented here in full tomorrow, immediately after the Commission has discussed it."
"With reference to Article 32 of the framework agreement, our proposal, which is a political decision at this stage, is intended as prior notification to the other institutions and, in line with established practice, the legal act of withdrawal will be taken in three months' time."
"This exercise has been long announced and the Commission has been open both on the methods and the objectives."
"We do not believe that any of the statements released to the press by individual Commissioners or by the President can be seen as undermining the prerogative of the Commission to act as a college or the commitments made to the other institutions."
"If you wish, I can provide the full list, detailing the series of occasion when these proposals were presented to this House in different forums – whether in the committees or in the form of decisions."
"I accept that there is always scope for improving communication and trust between our two institutions."
"I would like to reaffirm my personal commitment to keeping this objective high on the Commission agenda."
"I shall not miss any opportunity to remind colleagues that it is here that proposals should first be presented."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Wallström."
"Mrs Berès has requested the floor."
"Please tell me which Rule of the Rules of Procedure you are invoking."
"Mr President, I would like to speak about the organisation of the agenda simply in order to draw your attention to our method of working."
"I regret that a legislative text of absolutely crucial importance to the funding of our economy – which is, I repeat, a legislative text – should be included in today’s agenda only as from 7.30 p.m."
"I believe that it should have been scheduled for another day and another time."
"I understand the importance of these moments to pause for breath and to conduct political debates, but I believe that it is also important for our Parliament to treat its legislative work in a reasonable fashion."
"Thank you for your comment on the way we carry out our work, but we can only follow the order of business that we have adopted."
"The debate is closed."
"– The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, today is European Day of Languages."
"We are celebrating the language diversity that is part of our cultural heritage and makes for a richer society."
"Even as a young girl, I knew the following proverb: ‘The number of languages you speak is the number of times you are human’."
"This proverb also appears to be known on the Commission website where Commissioner Figel' makes a statement."
"That should encourage this House to give maximum support to sound programmes that promote the teaching of languages to as many people as possible."
"We in this House should, however, also realise that compliance with internal rules in the area of language diversity is an expression of respect for each human being and contributes to our institution’s democratic functioning."
"That is why I think it important, even though I do not have much time available to me, to draw your special attention to two issues."
"First of all, we must continue to make every effort in order to give all those who work in our House, Members and officials, the opportunity of attending language courses and secondly, you must encourage our officials to continue to respect our internal language rules to the letter and spirit."
"Whatever we do, we must not slip into the example the Council has given us, in the light of ..."
"Mr President, public transport is important to all our local communities."
"In Scotland, ferries provide an essential service to some of the European Union's most peripheral and vulnerable communities."
"This week I will be welcoming a delegation representing the CalMac trade unions to the European Parliament, who will be meeting the transport Commissioner on Wednesday."
"Presently these ferry services are being put out to tender in communities where they are the sole mode of transport connecting island communities to the mainland."
"Under the latest Commission proposals for land transport public service obligations, public administrations will be given flexibility over tendering processes and will be able to award certain services to in-house operators directly."
"Why, then, are lifeline ferries being treated differently to trains, trams and metros?"
"There are no trains, trams and metros in Scotland's peripheral island communities."
"The position of the Commission would appear to be contradictory and I urge the Commission to clarify its position."
"Lifeline ferry services are too important to be ignored."
"Mr President, I would like to share with you my concern about yet another example of a shocking homophobic speech in one of the national parliaments of an EU Member State."
"In this case we are talking about the Parliament of Latvia, which is discussing the implementation of Article 13 – on European anti-discrimination legislation – as well as a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriages."
"I note that not even George Bush dares go that far."
"I would like to appeal to our colleagues in the Latvian Parliament to conduct their debate with dignity, to condemn hate speeches and to remember that Latvia, like the other Member States, has signed up to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It has also ratified the EU Constitution, which forbids discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation."
"Mr President, colleagues, as you may already be aware, the Irish Republican Army has taken another initiative to assist peace in Ireland."
"Today's courageous decision to verifiably and definitively dispose of its weaponry represents a major advance for the peace process in Ireland."
"The enormity of what the IRA has done should neither be underestimated nor undervalued."
"I should like to take this opportunity to praise the IRA for taking risks when others shirked their responsibilities."
"An enormous responsibility has now been placed on both the British and Irish Governments to finally implement the Good Friday agreement in all its aspects, on issues such as equality, human rights, policing, demilitarisation and indeed northern representation in the Oireachtas."
"The Democratic Unionist Party, one of whose members is elected to this Parliament, must re-engage with the peace process."
"No possible excuse now exists for them not to sit down ..."
"Mr President, the signature of the agreement to build an undersea gas pipeline across the Baltic was accompanied by shots of President Putin of Russia locked in a warm embrace with Chancellor Schröder of Germany."
"This display of affection took place against the background of two major threats to peace and the security of the world’s economy."
"I refer to international terrorism and the price increases and instability affecting the market in raw materials for energy production."
"Everyone is aware that this situation calls for cooperation at global level."
"Unfortunately, just when the European Union should be setting an example of collective wisdom and solidarity between countries, Chancellor Schröder and President Putin trumpet abroad an unambiguous statement to the effect that all they care about is promoting the selfish interests of Germany and Russia."
"The fact that the countries across whose marine economic area the gas pipeline is to run were not informed or consulted illustrates the respect in which both countries hold the international law of the sea."
"We are firmly convinced that the agreement on building the gas pipeline was devised to be detrimental to several Member States of the European Union."
"Poland, the Baltic States and other countries will be forced to submit to Russian control of their energy supplies."
"The agreement also suggests a clear association …"
"Mr President, there are only 15 months left before the start of the Union's first new seven–year budgetary period."
"Despite the Union's agreed rules and conventions, however, we still do not have a draft budget."
"The Union is drifting rudderless across a budgetary ocean, so to speak."
"Each successive month of delay results in needless tension and unease, and gives rise to distrust between the old and new Member States."
"By failing to produce a budget, the Union is sending out the wrong kind of message to its future members and its external partners."
"It is presenting itself as weak, lacking vision for the future and the political will to work together in solidarity in order to build that future."
"This situation does not suggest stalemate, to borrow an expression from the game of chess."
"Rather, it suggests checkmate for the idea of a truly united Europe that is not split into a first and second class Europe according to wealth or historical legacy."
"I call on the Council and the UK Presidency to ensure that work on the budget is concluded at the earliest opportunity."
"Mr President, Poland is into its second year of membership of the European Union, but the outlook for Polish farmers is getting steadily worse, not better."
"Polish soft fruit growers account for 50% of production in Europe, yet they are on the verge of bankruptcy."
"The same is true of Polish potato growers, who are the main producers of this crop in the Union, and of producers of cereals and textile plants."
"It will not be long before producers of pork, milk and sugar beet find themselves in the same situation, and I would remind you that Poland is the third most important producer of sugar beet in Europe."
"Members of this House do understand the situation, but the same is not true of the European Commission, which tends to ignore Parliament and disregard the decisions it takes."
"This was what happened in the case of the report on starch production, for example."
"The planned reform of the market in sugar will mean a reduction of more than 42% in the price of sugar beet, which will make it uneconomic to produce."
"It would appear that the European Commission is more concerned about Chinese and Moroccan soft fruit growers and about Brazilian sugar producers than about farmers and producers in the new Member States."
"The question arises as to why the European Commission and the Commissioner himself are pursuing a policy that is detrimental to farmers in the Member States, and why decisions taken by the European Parliament are being disregarded."
"Mr President, I am taking the floor on behalf of Mr Pittella, from Italy, and Mrs Madeira, from Portugal, to ask the Presidency-in-Office of the Council, in the proposals on the financial perspective that it is to present, to reincorporate the criteria proposed by the Commission on the regions affected by the statistical effect, with regard to the need to support them without any shameful discrimination amongst them, since, as I said in this very House on 9 March, this is a question of dignity, of making European policy comprehensible, of making it egalitarian, balanced and democratic, faithful to its roots and to its ambitions."
"Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on this truly historic day for Ireland."
"In July of this year, the IRA called on its units to dump their arms and today we have verification that those words have been translated into action."
"Yes, there are still many bridges to cross, but today, in my opinion, we have crossed the Rubicon."
"There will be difficulties ahead; there are peace breakers on both sides who will try to derail this process."
"Massive support must therefore be given to peace builders, to ordinary people who on a day-to-day basis begin to build trust and seek out a shared future."
"We salute all of those, on both sides and none, who helped to bring us to this day."
"In the European Parliament, I wish to applaud the positive and supportive role of the European Union in this process."
"Finally, on this day we remember the victims and their families whose lives have been shattered."
"For them today comes too late, but for the rest of us it is hopefully a beginning."
"Mr President, we have recently become aware of the signature of an agreement between Germany and Russia concerning the building of a gas pipeline in the north of Europe, routed across the Baltic."
"Clearly, this is more than a significant economic agreement."
"It has an equally important political dimension."
"Poland and the Baltic States have been bypassed, much to the detriment of the national interests of countries that are part of the same structure, namely the European Union."
"Once again, the Union’s common economic and foreign policies have proved to be so much hot air, and many commentators and politicians are already likening the agreement signed recently to the 1939 Ribbentrop–Molotov pact."
"I call on Germany to comply with the procedures binding on all Member States and clarify the situation."
"I also call for the information provided to be made available to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Europe is capable of showing solidarity, as it demonstrated in connection with the tragic events in Portugal."
"Europe’s leaders can, however, behave selfishly at times, as was the case when Mr Chirac, Mr Schröder and Mr Putin met in Kaliningrad, a curious part of Russian territory."
"Subsequently, Mr Schröder and Mr Putin acted selfishly when they signed the agreement to build the gas pipeline."
"It is alleged that the purpose of the pipeline is to guarantee Germany’s energy supply, but that is only half the story."
"What Mr Schröder is about is supporting Mr Putin’s ‘divide and rule’ policy, which amounts to weakening the Union."
"The European Parliament should stand up for Europe and denounce this act for what it really is."
"Europe needs decisions that transcend local interests."
"It will never become integrated if we do not adopt cohesive policies."
"It would be like trying to build a brick house without using any mortar."
"– Mr President, we have received particularly worrying information over recent days from Turkish non-governmental human rights organisations about the prosecution and sentencing of Turkish journalists."
"I refer not only to the case of the author Orhan Pamuk, but also to the case of the journalist Emin Karaca, who has been sentenced to five months in prison for violating Article 301, paragraph 2, of the recently revised penal code."
"I also refer to other cases of journalists prosecuted under the same Article."
"In light of this situation, I call on the European Parliament and, more importantly, its President to take an immediate initiative addressed to the Turkish prime minister, Mr Erdogan, and to the speaker of the Turkish National Assembly, Mr Arinc, calling for prosecutions to cease and for freedom of speech to be respected, and to the UK Presidency and the European Commission ..."
"Mr President, although I am a firm believer in the use of a common working language of communication, I accept and respect the right of every MEP to listen and speak in his or her own national language."
"What I cannot accept, however, is the fact that more than a year after the accession of ten new Member States, there is still at least one parliamentary committee in which no interpretation for certain new Member State languages is provided, and that colleagues from these states are unable to take part in the deliberations of these committees using their official mother tongue."
"This obviously puts these colleagues at an unfair disadvantage."
"It is not an acceptable state of affairs and I call on you to reassure the House, on this day of linguistic freedom, that this regrettable situation will be remedied as soon as possible and that it will not arise again when the next two new Member States join the EU in the near future."
"Mr President, one quarter of the Irish GDP is tied up in construction."
"We could say that Ireland is a country under construction."
"However, in many of the villages around the cities of my constituency, houses are being thrown up with no thought for utilities, for enough water or sewage, or for the important elements of social infrastructure."
"Children spend their whole education in Portakabins."
"Often there are no sports fields or crèches and few shops."
"Rural villages quickly become dormitory towns with no sense of community."
"Is that alright with Europe?"
"Does it tally with rural development?"
"I need answers for the people of Watergrass Hill, Glenville and other towns: the people who are struggling with life in shiny new clusters of houses with no soul."
"– Mr President, I should like to take advantage of today's celebration of the European Day of Languages to express my concern about the lack of teaching of their mother tongue to the children of nationals of the Member States who move and establish in other Member States of the Union, with the result that these children forget their language of origin and, at the same time, their cultural identity."
"The linguistic assimilation which children and young Europeans undergo when they re-establish, especially those whose mother tongue is less widely spoken than the European languages spoken by millions of European citizens, does not help to maintain the linguistic diversity which the European Union alleges that it wishes to maintain."
"I call on the Commission, within the framework of the new strategy on multilingualism, to monitor the effective application of Directive 77/486/ΕEC of 25 July 1977 on the education of the children of migrant workers ..."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Europe is celebrating an important date: the European Day of Languages."
"This event, first held in 2001, involves the European Union and, above all, the Council of Europe, which has planned events throughout Europe."
"Today we welcome here our new Romanian and Bulgarian colleagues; with them, Bulgarian and Romanian will join our Community family of languages on 1 January 2007, raising the number of official languages from 20 to 22."
"For us Europeans, language is synonymous with culture and history and hence with a vast historical and cultural heritage."
"I wonder, then, whether it would not be appropriate for us, as the European Parliament, at last to promote a constructive reform of the language regime within the Community institutions."
"I am certainly delighted at the arrival of the new languages and especially of those that will soon become part of our daily work, but on the other hand I am extremely concerned at the chaos and lack of written rules, as has been confirmed to me by the European Commission."
"– Mr President, a man died."
"He had been known as a merciless avenger by many, even though he had been seeking justice, not revenge."
"He was motivated by the conviction that if people who had committed crimes can leave the past behind without any consequences, this past would return, poisoning both the present and the future."
"Simon Wiesenthal died."
"He was human and sometimes made mistakes."
"But he could not come to terms with the fact that Europe, the new world building a collective future based on its common values, had already been united once in the past."
"United in the assumption of racial superiority, in condemnation, ostracism and hatred."
"A 96-year-old man passed away."
"His legacy to us is the knowledge that contempt for another human being and taking human lives should never be allowed to unite Europe again."
"Let us think of him when we work to ensure that the unity of the new Europe is based on equal treatment and equal opportunities."
"In remembrance of him we ask the Committee that in paragraph 13 ..."
"– Mr President, I should like to apprise plenary of a very serious matter."
"As we speak, the Turkish authorities are in the final stage of constructing a dam."
"This dam, which is scheduled for completion on 15 November, in other words in fewer than 50 days from today, will result in the flooding and definitive loss of one of the most important archaeological sites in Asia Minor today."
"I refer to Allianoi, a Roman spa centre which lies 18 kilometres from the town of Bergama."
"The archaeological site of Allianoi consists of an entire complex of spas which, it would appear, complemented the famous Bergama Asklepion."
"I believe that the European Parliament should take a stand on the question of this loss and, given that the Commission's reply was unsatisfactory, I propose that the President of Parliament write to the Turkish president calling for a halt to work to complete the dam, which will result in the definitive loss of a piece of European cultural heritage."
"Mr President, in the presence of Commissioner McCreevy and his colleagues, I would like to put down a marker about the Commission's proposed reform of the sugar regime."
"Contrary to received wisdom, global sugar consumption already outstrips demand."
"The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization forecast world sugar consumption at 145 million tonnes for 2004 and 2005, with production at 143 million tonnes. World sugar consumption next year is said to reach 149 million tonnes, with per capita consumption in China alone expected to increase from its current 10 kilograms to the EU level of 35 kilograms in the medium term."
"In Brazil the consumption per capita is already 50 kilograms."
"In addition the availability of irrigation water in developing countries and elsewhere is decreasing, and this will dictate a swing away from the cultivation of sugar cane, a water-intensive crop."
"Factor in the inevitable impact on sugar cane consumption patterns by the projected increases in gasohol as oil prices rise and alternative biofuel technologies become mainstream. Sugar may increasingly become a strategic commodity."
"The world is facing a long-term surge in demand."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I take the floor with regard to the situation in Western Sahara."
"In August, the Polisario Front freed the last Moroccan prisoners of war. That is a positive step, which has met with the approval of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, President Bush and the whole international community."
"The same is not happening, however, with those detained in Moroccan jails: the physical condition of the tens of Sahrawi detainees on hunger strike is now critical, according to Amnesty International reports."
"Among them are women and men who are standing up for human rights."
"Europe must not remain silent, but must take decisive steps to secure the freedom of those upholding human rights; to ensure that Morocco, the Sahrawi who have stayed in Western Sahara and the refugees reach an agreement to live in peace, working together to create the new democratic Arab-Sahrawi Republic; and to ensure that they no longer live in exile or in prison."
"Mr President, I also wish to welcome our Romanian colleagues, in particular to my own group, from the Romanian Democratic Party, the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania and the Romanian Conservative Party."
"The observers will clearly be learning the way that we work, which may be rather complicated, but I also believe that we should learn from Romania's history."
"Romania has suffered from Fascism under the Iron Guard and from Communism under Ceausescu."
"However, because it is politically convenient, many people have forgotten that Bessarabia was illegally invaded by Stalin with the complicity of Hitler."
"Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives or were exiled, and that part of Romania was subjected."
"Certain chapters in the history of Central and Eastern Europe have been forgotten and we have to look at them."
"We should not make this an obsession, but we must draw conclusions and look to the future."
"Romania before Communism and Fascism was one of great prosperity, with the Anglo-Romanian oil company and significant investment from France."
"Mr President, members from across national borders and political boundaries are in support of John Packwood, who faces extradition from Spain to Morocco, which is something that could not happen to a Spanish citizen."
"This is, of course, a violation of the equal treatment of EU citizens, enshrined in the Treaty."
"It is discrimination which I call most strongly on the Commission and the President to oppose by making representations to the Spanish Government before the extradition deadline."
"A case must be allowed to be developed that can go to the Court of Human Rights, but this is also being denied as matters are being pushed through quickly."
"He is a desperate man facing a desperate plight and he needs all our support."
"I urge you to help in this case."
"Mr President, on 15 September a Russian fighter plane carrying four missiles entered Lithuanian airspace and crashed near the city of Kaunas."
"It was part of a group of six fighters accompanying a Russian spy plane from St Petersburg to Kaliningrad."
"It was a most serious incident in a long series of violations of Finnish and Baltic airspace by Russian planes."
"On the eve of the EU-Russia summit I should like to ask the Commission how systematic violation by Russian planes of the borders of EU Member States can be tallied with the common values upon which the EU-Russia partnership is officially based."
"Is not the integrity of the EU's eastern border part of our common foreign and security policy?"
"As for Kaliningrad, is it not in the interests of all parties to start to find ways to demilitarise this last vestige of the Cold War in Europe?"
"In 1940, as the threat of war loomed, Italy removed from the territory of Slovenian Istria, Koper, Izola and Piran works of art that had been created in those locations under commission from the Church and private individuals."
"The works were produced by Italian masters."
"Just as Yugoslavia did previously, the Slovenian state has made intensive efforts on behalf of the owners to secure the return of these priceless works."
"Italy has avoided taking this matter seriously and rejects all efforts from the Slovenian side for a diplomatic resolution to the problem."
"Therefore on 22 September this year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again sent a Note Verbale communicating its renewed request for a diplomatic resolution to this issue."
"Italy is bound by international treaty to return everything that it removed from occupied territory, and for this reason we justifiably expect these works of art to be returned to Slovenia."
"– The debate is closed."
"– The next item is the debate on the Commission statement: ‘Twenty-fifth anniversary of Solidarity and its message for Europe’."
"In introducing this debate, I must emphasise how Solidarity’s contribution to the events leading to a united Europe may be seen as a chance and an opportunity for a generation to learn about freedom: the West certainly did much for the countries of Eastern Europe under the Soviet yoke, but Solidarity has perhaps done much more for the West and for a generation of Westerners."
". Mr President, the historic events of August 1980 started the process which ended the cold war and led to the reunification of Europe."
"The action led at that time by Solidarność is a symbol of the value that all Europeans attach to the shared values of freedom and solidarity."
"Because of the courage and determination of the leaders of Solidarność and the inspiration it provided to so many, the influence of the strike of shipyard workers in Gdansk did not stop at the Polish borders."
"It brought fresh sap to the many buds of dissent and democracy which were then burgeoning throughout central and eastern Europe and which allowed the unification of our continent."
"As was mentioned by the President of the Commission in Gdansk on 31 August, 'Solidarity' was an inspired choice of name for the union which was born from the strike in Gdansk."
"It conveyed strength, determination and focus."
"Solidarity is today one of the six titles of the European Charter for Fundamental Rights."
"The remembrance of the events of August 1980 enriches this word with meaning and emotion."
"Freedom was what Solidarność fought for and it is today also closely associated with solidarity as a fundamental value shared by Europeans."
"There is no Europe without solidarity."
"Solidarność is a meaningful symbol to remind future generations of Europeans of this alliance."
"The Commission has been happy to contribute to the commemorative events which took place in Gdansk three weeks ago, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of these historic events, upon the invitation of the Polish Government and of the honourable Members of this Parliament."
"The Commission will listen to the views of this House; and, be assured, will look favourably on initiatives aiming to mark 31 August with the seal of remembrance."
". Mr President, the Solidarity movement had three meanings."
"Firstly, for Poland, it meant breaking free from the foreign Soviet model."
"Secondly, for Central and Eastern Europe it meant doing away with the division of Europe effected at Yalta at the end of the Second World War."
"As a result, the part of Europe cut off from the rest of Europe by Communism was able to regain its rightful place in the mainstream of our continent’s political history."
"In this sense, therefore, the events at the Gdansk shipyard, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the revolution in Kiev are all stages in Europe’s journey to freedom."
"Thirdly, for Western Europe Solidarity meant rediscovering the true meaning of values that had disappeared from public life as a result of ."
"I refer to values such as freedom, solidarity, democracy and the dignity of the individual."
"Thanks to Solidarity, many people in Western Europe came to understand that the fundamental values revived by Solidarity had to become part of the fabric of the reorganised and reunited Europe."
"The message and significance of these events transcends the experience of a single nation."
"They have a far more universal meaning and a pan-European nature."
"Their message is one of European unity."
"If the Schuman plan is recognised as the basic premise underpinning European integration, then the Gdansk shipyard demands must be seen as heralding another important stage in the process."
"In their September 1981 message to workers in Central and Eastern Europe, Solidarity activists wrote about the sense of a common fate uniting all Europeans in the eastern part of our continent."
"Twenty-five years later that same expression appeared in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty, referring on this occasion to the enlarged European Union."
"The Solidarity movement highlights the importance of solidarity as the basis of any system of trust and unity."
"Solidarity, understood to mean shouldering each other’s burdens, has a very practical expression indeed as far as the European Union is concerned."
"It means financial solidarity regarding security and solidarity in foreign policy."
"Only by displaying such solidarity can we attain European unity."
". – Mr President, in July and August 1980, Polish workers in Lublin, along the Baltic coast and in many other towns took strike action."
"At the end of August this action became a general strike affecting the whole country."
"The action was led and organised by an Inter-enterprise Strike Committee and by Lech Wałęsa at the Gdansk shipyard."
"Workers and the intelligentsia rebelled in the cause of freedom, social justice and dignity."
"The slogans of freedom, equality and brotherhood shouted out again from European banners just as they had 200 years earlier in Paris."
"On 31 August an agreement was signed at the Gdansk shipyard."
"In it, the State authorities agreed to the 21 demands made by the strikers."
"This led to the emergence of the Independent and Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity."
"The general strike and Solidarity’s activities became a source of hope for workers the world over in the struggle for workers’ rights, a just society and a better world."
"Solidarity set off a chain reaction across Eastern Europe, which led eventually to a peaceful democratic revolution and a victory for democracy and human rights."
"It also meant the beginning of the end of the totalitarian system and the division of Europe, symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"Twenty-five years later, here at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, at the political heart of a united Europe, it is fitting to honour the Polish workers and all those who rebelled against oppression and injustice, and played a part in the creation of the Solidarity Trade Union."
"Particular recognition is due to those who continued to pursue independent activity after the introduction of martial law in Poland."
"I would like to pay tribute to all the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe, who are to be admired for their struggle in the cause of democracy, human rights and national sovereignty."
"Mr President, we were not alone in this struggle."
"We recall the help Solidarity received from the international trade union movement, from Western European civil society and from democratic governments."
"Thank you, Europe!"
"Thanks are also due to all those Europeans who sided with Solidarity and supported our fight for freedom and democracy when we were in prison or driven underground."
"The European Union should be proud of this heritage, proud of having given such proof of brotherhood."
"Brotherhood underpins European unity."
"In its programme, namely the 21 Gdansk demands, and also the Self-Governing Republic programme, Solidarity presented a vision of a society and a country bound together by freedom, where human rights were respected and social justice prevailed."
"This vision remains relevant today."
"Solidarity’s programme can still serve as an inspiration at global level and also at European level, as Europe tackles the challenge of creating an effective economy and a just society."
"In today’s world, Solidarity stands for a refusal to condone poverty and oppression anywhere on the globe."
"It demands that the European Union act to wipe poverty off the face of the earth."
"In the 21st century, Solidarity’s message demands a European Union foreign policy that actively promotes democracy and human rights, and support for those who are currently persecuted because they belong to a minority."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I would first like to pay tribute to the Polish workers who set in motion the process of the liberation and unification of Europe."
"I am moved and grateful to note that both the European Parliament and the European Commission appreciate the significance of the events that took place on Polish soil 25 years ago."
"Polish workers took to their hearts the message of the Polish Pope, who urged them not to have fear."
"It was Polish workers who took action on behalf of their country, which longed for freedom."
"In so doing they proved those who believed that the proletariat has no fatherland to be mistaken."
"The workers took action in the name of freedom, standing up to a regime and a system that claimed to represent them."
"They made political demands, and called for freedom and the establishment of a free trade union to represent them."
"The workers also demanded freedom of the press, freedom of information and a state that was not controlled by Communist Party officials."
"All these demands expressed something crucial to the very essence of Europe, as they were demands for freedom."
"It is also the case that when the Gdansk shipyard workers took action to improve their lot and that of their families, they were aware that their situation was the result of an alien regime that had been imposed on them."
"It was a regime to which the Polish nation had never consented."
"The amazing achievement of this mass movement of 10 million workers, farm labourers, and members of the intelligentsia was a peaceful revolution."
"It was a movement that encompassed the whole of Polish society and amounted to a rebellion against totalitarianism."
"‘Without the use of force’ is a principle worth adhering to in today’s world too."
"It was a movement inspired by values."
"We are proud that the word solidarity has become part of the language of politics."
"It is a very significant word for us, a truly Polish word, and represents Poland’s contribution to the idea of Europe."
"Mr President, it is my belief that the unification of Europe began at Gdansk, that East and West came together as a result of the movement started by the Gdansk shipyard workers, and that many other nations followed where Poland and Solidarity led."
"Solidarity inspired nations to be reborn and peoples to rise up for freedom."
"We feel proud of this, but above all we feel solidarity with those who brought freedom to Georgia through the Rose Revolution and to Ukraine through the Orange Revolution."
"We hope that this non-violent example of regime change by way of negotiation, allowing European ideals to become reality, will remain relevant to today’s world."
"I feel sure it is important for Europe that as the European Union seeks its own identity, it should wish today to chart the course taken by the people who worked for the freedom of Europe."
"They were the men and women who ended the Cold War and made the unification of Europe possible."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen from Poland, it is more than merely symbolic that we should, today, not only be welcoming the observers from Bulgaria and Romania, but also remembering the great triumph of Solidarity 25 years ago."
"I am glad that the Commission has had something to say about the Solidarity movement today."
"One might think there were occasions of greater contemporary relevance and that the celebrations over the past weeks had paid sufficient tribute to history, but our debate today shows that the opposite is the case."
"When I joined in the celebrations in Warsaw and Gdansk three weeks ago, it was again brought home to me just how relevant to our own time this groundbreaking historic event actually is."
"The legendary strike by Solidarity that we are commemorating is part of our living heritage, and has lost none of its significance in 25 years."
"It was the politically and socially oppressed and disadvantaged who, by their courage, succeeded in bringing to an end the totalitarian Communist regimes in Poland and, following on from that, in other countries in Central and Eastern Europe; their boundless desire for reform is on all our lips."
"Above all, though, we revere the memory of the victims of these totalitarian regimes, remembering those who were oppressed, arrested, shot dead during protest strikes, condemned and executed after show trials."
"One man – the priest, Father Jerzy Popiełuszko, can be taken as representative of all of them."
"The years 1953, 1956, and 1968 are significant in the histories of East Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, but Solidarity gave impetus and reinforcement to the civil rights movements in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Charta 77, which campaigned for traditional, political human rights, the ‘Swords into Ploughshares’ peace campaign in the former East Germany, and the ‘Dunakör’ environmentalist movement in Hungary."
"What all this adds up to is that, without Solidarity, the Berlin Wall would not have fallen."
"I speak for this House when I say that debate mattered to those who supported the Solidarity movement in Poland – debate that involved our friends Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuroń, as well as Bronisław Geremek and Janusz Onyskiewicz, who are now Members of this House, and so we are very grateful to them for the way in which they, 25 years ago, laid the foundation stones of a Europe united in peace, freedom and democracy, a Europe guided by social and environmental principles."
"– Mr President, in the autumn of 1980 when I was 15 years old, I travelled to Poland for the first time in my life."
"We were a group of young Swedes cooperating with Poland’s independent movement of students and pupils."
"It was a youth movement that, in practice, was a part of Solidarity and of the huge and positive mobilisation that Solidarity stood for in the Polish society of the time."
"For me, the visit was a real eye-opener."
"The freedoms and rights that I, as a Swedish teenager, took for granted were things for which my Polish contemporaries had to fight hard."
"Poland was a society with a shortage of goods and manifest political oppression and, for most Poles, life was hard."
"With its demands for freedom, democracy and the right to national self-determination, Solidarity then stood for the hope of a better future."
"It was a progressive movement, and not only because it called for the democratisation of Polish society. As a union, it campaigned for higher wages, better pension conditions, influence in the work place for employees and better health care and child care."
"It was a genuinely progressive movement that was put down when, with the support of the Soviet Union, the military assumed power."
"In spite of military rule, there was no crushing the demands and hopes symbolised by Solidarity, however."
"The fact is that, on a number of occasions, spontaneous organisation on the part of workers, together with demands for independent trade unions, have been decisive in opposing the dictatorships in those countries dominated by the Soviet Union following the war."
"Solidarity and the Polish opposition constituted one – and perhaps the most important – of the succession of revolts against oppression."
"East Berlin in 1953, Budapest in 1956, Pozna in the same year and Prague in 1968 were cases in which the democratic opposition was put down using violence."
"More often than not, it was workers – organised as they were and with their demands for justice and democracy – who were in the front rank of the protesters."
"Today, Poland is a political democracy among other political democracies."
"Huge progress has been made in crucial areas since the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"An important factor behind this – indeed, perhaps the absolutely crucial factor – was Solidarity’s efforts in opposing the old regime."
"This development has led to a better future, not only for Poland but for the whole of Europe."
"At the same time, a lot remains to be done, considering the social demands made by Solidarity in terms of worker influence and a better standard of living."
"Poland is at present a society in which many people are badly off and in which there is very high unemployment."
"At the same time, very few people are organised in trade unions, and employees often struggle to make their voices heard."
"If something is to be done about this, a strong, well-organised trade union movement is needed."
". Mr President, the 25th anniversary of the emergence of Poland’s Solidarity is not simply an occasion on which to commemorate that event, which marked the beginning of the unification of Europe."
"It is also an opportunity to recall a fundamental truth about the activities of people and nations, and about the moral and political foundations of the European Union."
"The slogan that inspired millions of members of this trade union in 1980 and 1981 and also during the period of martial law was ‘There can be no freedom without Solidarity’."
"We were fully aware that it was upon solidarity between human beings that Solidarity with a capital S was based."
"That was what ensured its success and indeed its survival."
"It is also true that Western politicians and societies took this slogan to heart as they supported the people of Poland in their struggle for national sovereignty and democracy."
"This slogan therefore recalls the actions ‘Let Poland be Poland’ and ‘Solidarity with Solidarity’, and also the material aid that the union, its activists and many millions of ordinary Poles received from citizens of countries in the West."
"You must believe me, ladies and gentlemen, when I say that the political, moral and material solidarity shown to us by people in the West helped to keep our hopes alive and made us feel that our efforts were not hopeless and that we were not alone."
"I experienced this myself."
"I should like today to take the opportunity of having the floor in the European Parliament to offer sincere thanks to all those people of good will who expressed solidarity with us."
"In their wider meaning, the lessons of solidarity, with and without a capital S, remain valid today."
"‘There can be no freedom without Solidarity’ also means that freedom is not an end in itself."
"In its economic sense, freedom is essential, but if it is bereft of solidarity it results in the rich becoming richer and the poor becoming poorer and affects individual economies across the whole European Union."
"Freedom can easily turn into anarchy or a new kind of oppression if it lacks a moral dimension."
"Freedom without solidarity amounts to self-will."
"Sooner or later it harms the individual or the community."
"It breaks up families and societies."
"Those who attempt to install freedom without solidarity and without fundamental rights such as the right to life, justice and honesty are disregarding the rights of others and undermining the community."
"Ultimately, they are endangering freedom itself."
"Mr President, Poland’s Solidarity movement came into being a quarter of a century ago."
"This peaceful non-violent movement proved as effective as the movement led by the great Mahatma Ghandi a few decades earlier had been."
"Ghandi’s movement eventually led to Indian independence, whilst Solidarity was instrumental in Poland regaining its sovereignty and Poles their freedom."
"Solidarity was instrumental in much more besides."
"It led to the peaceful revolution in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Nine years after the so-called outbreak of Solidarity, Czechoslovakia underwent the Velvet Revolution, and the fall of the Berlin Wall followed."
"The origins of these events can, however, be traced back to 1980 and to Gdansk, in Poland."
"Solidarity was not just a trade union with 10 million members, representing almost 40% of the adult population of my country."
"It was also a movement working for democratic freedoms, free elections, free media and freedom of religion."
"I cannot be impartial, as I am a Pole, but even so, I firmly believe that Solidarity was a crucial turning point in our common European 20th century history."
"Today, 25 years later, I should like to pay tribute to Solidarity as a Pole and as a European."
"It was largely due to this movement that my country and neighbouring nations gained their freedom."
"Our freedom is not all it could be."
"We still have many economic and social problems to deal with, but the most important thing is that we do now enjoy real freedom and are in a position to put our own house in order."
"I should like to thank the many millions of ordinary working people in my homeland whose efforts enabled us to be in this fortunate position."
"Poland and the whole of Europe owe you a debt of gratitude."
"We are all indebted to Solidarity."
"I wholeheartedly welcome the attention devoted by the European Commission and European Parliament to Solidarity, without which we would not be celebrating the collapse of communist totalitarianism or the historic enlargement of the European Union."
"On this occasion I cannot ignore the memory of how deeply the phenomenon of Solidarity strengthened the hopes of democrats in Slovenia, and the significance for us at that time of the words of John Paul II, when he said ‘Do not be afraid.’"
"As we express our recognition of Solidarity and remember with special reverence those who paid for the desire for freedom and democracy with their lives, we are aware that Solidarity is no museum piece, but an inspiration, a concept, and a much needed way forward, without which European and global development is unimaginable."
"We are erecting a monument to Solidarity, but not archiving it, for we wish to develop it further."
"There is an obvious need for solidarity between generations, between social partners, between more developed countries and less developed countries in the areas of security, disaster relief and so on. I firmly believe that the quality of our lives in the future will depend on the fulfilment of this essential principle."
"I think that following the historic breakthrough we need another period of Solidarity."
"Mr President, a certain measure of modesty is in order for someone who, like me, was born in the Netherlands in peacetime after the Second World War."
"I think that today is the right time for people who have not lived under the yoke of Communism to pay their respects to those who, particularly in Poland, rose against a regime that we all considered reprehensible."
"It was a very special chapter in Poland’s history and I am delighted that we are commemorating it today in this Parliament, in Strasbourg."
"Although it forms an important part of Polish history, it is not for the Poles alone, for the example of – Solidarity – has led to much discussion and movement and has had an enormous impact outside Poland."
"I would say that, even after 25 years, Solidarity is a household word in my country, the Netherlands, too."
"What was so special was that the workers at a Gdansk shipyard staged a protest, went on strike, but also enjoyed the support of a group of prominent intellectuals who were prepared to stick their necks out and oppose the regime in Poland."
"I think that it was, in fact, an example of the best the labour movement as we have known it in Europe had to offer, the democratic labour movement that, in terms of freedom, political awareness and emancipation, has also had great significance in our countries."
"It has also, I think, been a source of inspiration to many, not only in Eastern European countries, but also in Western Europe, and people, not least in the Netherlands, have also often been surprised at the moral fibre of the strikers in Gdansk who stood up to the Communist regime in this fashion."
"We now know, with the benefit of hindsight, that the work of Solidarity also meant the beginning of the end of a fantastic revolution in Poland’s history; we can now say that Poland has at long last found its rightful place, free in Europe."
"That is also the Poland that, to my mind, should be the centre of attention."
"The Polish struggle for freedom, and its history, enrich our continent; the story of the Polish plumber become even more poignant in the light of this historic role."
"Although Solidarity lives on in Poland and in the hearts of the Polish people, as is evident once again today, it also deserves to be remembered as a shining, European example."
"Mr President, the Socialists of the 19th and early 20th centuries saw it as the ideal that human society should be based on the equality of all people and on their mutual solidarity; that people should not be made subordinate to the state or their employer, and that we should be free to make our own choices and organise society from the bottom up."
"They were aware that, in a society in which one group oppresses the other, nobody – not even the oppressors – can be really free."
"This belief would certainly have led those old Socialists, including their great thinker Karl Marx, to applaud the Polish workers’ protest in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century."
"Any authoritarian regime that skimps on wages and benefits while favouring a small group of people deserves to go under as a result of mass protest."
"Normally speaking, workers’ protests are directed at big business’ desire for profit or at a government that considers itself to be right-wing."
"That was certainly not the case in Poland, where the state was founded upon Socialism, the intellectual legacy of Marx, common ownership of the means of production and the equality of all people."
"That state was not the product of the working class struggle, but of the way in which, after the Second World War, the victors shared out the military spheres of influence ."
"The people experienced the reality of that moment as the complete opposite of what Socialists claim to pursue."
"That is one of the reasons that in the mid-80s, I was a speaker at a meeting in the Netherlands for solidarity with the suppressed independent trade union in Poland."
"I have never shared the opinion that workers should be content with their leaders when these call themselves Socialists or Communists."
"Meanwhile, people holding strongly differing opinions talk about Solidarity’s legacy, both inside and outside Poland."
"To one group, it represented the return to the Conservative Poland of the Pilsudski period between the wars; to the other, it was a necessary step towards the replacement of the caricature of Socialism conceived after 1945 by a real, Socialist democracy."
"The former opinion appears, for the time being, to have the upper hand; while not deploring this outcome, I do consider the resistance to unacceptable rule an inherent right of all people, and Solidarity an inspiring example."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Solidarity made it possible for me to be in this Chamber today, and I am eternally grateful to it for that, and for not having been condemned to life behind the Iron Curtain."
"Had it not been for Solidarity, the Berlin Wall would have fallen later, or might even still be standing."
"Attempts had been made previously by the Czechs, Slovaks and Hungarians to overthrow that diabolical system, but it was the Poles and the Polish Pope who eventually succeeded in dismantling the agreements reached at Yalta."
"I should today like to thank the countries of Western Europe and the United States for their support."
"It should be remembered, however, that Stalin was not the only guilty party."
"Churchill and Roosevelt betrayed half of Europe to the Soviets at Yalta, hoping for peace and quiet and to make things easier for themselves."
"The example of Solidarity shows us how many long years it can take to put mistakes right."
"With Parliament’s consent, the Union is now opening negotiations with Turkey."
"I fear this may be the beginning of the end for the Union, and I regret it very much, as I am in favour of a common Europe."
"We should show solidarity with the whole world, but not betray Europe in the name of internationalism."
"Mr President, the fact that the left has just been voted out of office in Poland lends added poignancy to this debate."
"I congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski and the Civic Platform, as well as the Law and Justice Party, on their victory in yesterday's general election, and I am sure Poland has a great future under new leadership."
"Lech Wałęsa is the most prominent personification of Solidarity and its success."
"He was in Brussels recently to receive the acclaim of this House on its important anniversary."
"He has won many honours from countries and organisations around the world in recognition of his courage and vision, perhaps the greatest honour being his election as Poland's President after Communism crumbled."
"Britain has always felt a special affinity with Poland, and this was evidenced in the early 1980s when Poland was going through very difficult times."
"It was a British Conservative Minister for Foreign Affairs, Malcolm Rifkind, who went to Warsaw and became the first western politician to meet with representatives of Solidarity, an act that infuriated the Communist regime."
"This meeting was symbolic of the deep bond between Britain and Poland."
"All through those grim years we in Britain never forgot Poland, nor did we ever lose our conviction that democracy and freedom would ultimately prevail and that Poland would once again take its honoured place in the European family."
"It is easy to forget the speed with which Europe has moved on from those dark days and what life was like for those under the yoke of Communist tyranny."
"That is why it is so important that we never forget, and with Poland rightly taking its place in the European Union last year we can be sure that those who suffered and those who inflicted the suffering will not be forgotten."
"Solidarity symbolised then, as it does now, hope in the future, the determination of people to build better lives for themselves and their families and an unshakeable belief in the power of the human spirit."
"Political systems can subjugate wills and extinguish individuality but they can never quench the desire to be free."
"We would all do well to learn the lessons that Solidarity's history teaches us."
"– Mr President, the Gdansk shipyards, for the benefit of the previous speakers, where the 25th anniversary of the start of the Solidarity strikes in 1980 was celebrated, employed 6 000 workers."
"Today, now that the shipyards have been privatised, two thirds of the workforce was dismissed in the 1990s."
"Mr Walesa and Solidarity, of course, did not go on any strikes because it was they who dismissed them."
"In the town of Gdansk, which you have as a symbol, poverty reigns."
"Unemployment exceeds 15%."
"In ‘free’ Poland, working farmers, the grass roots, live in drastic conditions."
"The standard of living is plummeting."
"Fourteen years after the overthrow of socialism, the Poles are consuming less, including less basic foods, than in 1980."
"All social achievements have been eroded."
"Foreign capital is plundering the country."
"Farmers are being wiped out and new latifundia are being created."
"The course of events demonstrates, therefore, that Solidarity was the Trojan Horse for the restoration of capitalism in Poland."
"The leaders deceived the workers."
"They projected pro-labour demands, trapped them and brought them to this pass."
"They had economic and political support from the United States and governments in other capitalistic countries, which are today reaping huge profits for capital and creating poverty among the Polish people."
"For the benefit of the previous speakers, Walesa's slogans of alleged freedom and solidarity for the workers, led them – impoverished, subjugated and disenfranchised – into the hands of the capitalists."
"As far as democracy in Poland is concerned, let me quote you just one statistic: 20% voted in the last European elections."
"That is what they think about the European Union."
"Mr President, I should like to say to the previous speaker that those workers and others would not, at any price, wish to turn the clock back to the time before Solidarity."
"There are few events one wishes to refer to with pride and pleasure, particularly in this House."
"In my view, solidarity is a concept that deserves a special entry in all encyclopaedias."
"It is not easy to show solidarity."
"It is often necessary to sacrifice one’s own interests, national interests and possibly higher ones too."
"The European Union is not a cohesive unit like a nation, an ethnic group, or maybe a political one."
"That is why an effort of solidarity is needed."
"It was only thanks to the determination and solidarity of workers, students, farmers, academics and sometimes of police and army officers that refused to be intimidated, along with the solidarity shown by people from abroad, that it was possible to force the dinosaurs clinging on to power to surrender it."
"That enabled ordinary decent people to reinstate respectable values."
"If we find it within us to recognise the meaning of the Solidarity movement, and to learn this historic lesson, we shall be in a position to hope that the measures voted through in this House will be implemented."
"We shall also be in a position to hope that the coordinated body known as the Union will gradually come into being."
"Europe is too complex and diverse for this aim to be achieved without solidarity."
"Solidarity must be promoted in this House, in the Commission, and through educational and cultural programmes."
"It needs to be grafted onto all Europeans."
"At the same time, we should be developing a broader solidarity that could be termed supra-continental, in order to help deal with the problems facing mankind."
"Allow me to emphasise that without solidarity there can be no future for Europe or for mankind as a whole."
"In its 1980 version, solidarity began in Świdnik and Lublin, and it made it possible for us to be able to discuss fundamental values in this House today."
"It is for contemporary European solidarity to ensure that at the end of the next 25 years, Members will be able to speak in similar terms about today’s Parliament and Commission, and credit them with playing a leading role in the historical process we are all involved in."
"Mr President, today we are commemorating the 25th anniversary of Polish Solidarity and debating its message for Europe."
"We remember the days and months when the Polish people could take no more and when Polish workers went on strike in Gdansk."
"We remember the fight that set in motion so much more than simply the struggle for Polish freedom. What it set in motion was the fight for the freedom of the whole of Eastern Europe."
"The first stone to fall from the Berlin Wall fell not in Berlin but in Gdansk."
"We often forget, however, that the strike and the solidarity in Gdansk were preceded by years of Polish revolt against Communism."
"Many fought for freedom, doing so each independently and in different ways, but there was no combined force uniting all Poles around the same idea."
"Only when a Polish pope was installed in the Vatican did the Poles realise that they were united by their spiritual inheritance and that there were forces that would take them forward to independence and autonomy. And so it came to pass."
"I myself was living at that time in Communist Yugoslavia and clearly remember the pictures from Gdansk."
"I could not understand how anyone could actually believe it was possible to topple Communism."
"When, almost two decades after Gdansk, the people of Serbia protested against Milosevic’s regime, they had learned something from Solidarity."
"They had learned that totalitarian regimes do not go on forever, but can in actual fact come tumbling down."
"They had also learned that democracy must always come about from within and that victory necessarily falls to a unified people fighting for its freedom."
"The most important message for Europe had already been sent by Solidarity."
"My fellow Member, Mr Sjöstedt from Sweden, who belongs to a party whose leader still calls himself a Communist, has just made a speech in which he paid tribute to Solidarity, a movement that fought specifically against Communism."
"This too is a message sent by Solidarity to Europe: that Europe does not tolerate either Communist, or any other, dictatorships or, indeed, any systems of totalitarianism or enslavement."
"The future of Europe lies in freedom, and that is something we all defend, and today most especially by expressing our respect for, and gratitude towards, the people of Poland and Eastern Europe who fought for a free Europe during the 1980s and 90s."
"Mr President, Solidarity was an extraordinary experiment involving a community that developed on the basis of common values and confidence in freedom."
"In August 1980 Polish workers demanded freedom of the press, freedom of religious belief and above all freedom to set up free trade unions and an end to persecution for reasons of conviction."
"Millions of Poles said ‘no’ to Communism, and this was the beginning of the end of the Communist dictatorship."
"We called on the nations of Eastern Europe to engage in the struggle for civil liberties, which involved building a civil society."
"We did so with determination and strong in the belief that freedom can be won in spite of all overtly political restrictions."
"Millions of individuals committed themselves in solidarity to the life of their own country, a country that was free for 16 months until 13 December, when General Jaruzelski’s Communist dictatorship struck against this movement with a ."
"It was impossible to stifle or break our spirit, however, and we continued to live as free people."
"Communism was mortally wounded at the Gdansk shipyard in August 1980, and received its nine years later in 1989."
"We were helped in our struggle by other European nations."
"France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom all supported us."
"This gave us courage and a belief in our own strength, and I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who stood by us at that time."
"It was thanks to you that we survived, strong in the knowledge that Europe was thinking of us and that we had not been forgotten."
"To what extent can the ideals of solidarity move hearts and consciences today?"
"Nowadays, reflecting about Solidarity means reflecting about the nature of Europe."
"Europe is more than an economy and a market."
"It also stands for the values that make the European Community great."
"Europe is a family of nations built on a Christian heritage."
"Solidarity was founded on Christian principles and it strove to reawaken the best of human values in people."
"I refer to taking responsibility for each other, and being prepared to help those in need."
"The Solidarity ethic could contribute to the creation of a contemporary vision of Europe that would awaken the interest of the world."
"Reflecting about Solidarity nowadays also means reflecting about how to counter national egoism amongst the 25 Member States of the Union."
"I am confident that this can be achieved."
"I believe in a European Union imbued with solidarity, a Union that is capable of being competitive, but which is simultaneously capable of demonstrating solidarity with the small and the weak."
"I believe in a Union that will hold high the banner of Solidarity and freedom, and be an inspiration to those who lack them."
"Mr President, 25 years ago Polish workers and intellectuals succeeded in creating a democratic civic alternative to the rigid communist structures."
"Solidarność started the process of East European nations becoming genuinely free from totalitarian enslavement."
"The other lung of the same European homeland, to quote Pope John Paul II, started to breathe and to bring oxygen and self-respect to tens of millions of Eastern Europeans."
"Poland is a symbol for Europe."
"It was the first victim of the alliance of Hitler and Stalin, who together launched the Second World War."
"The Polish nation experienced the worst of both of these dictatorships."
"It is not by chance perhaps that the victory of the Gdansk workers opened the way for the reunification of Europe."
"I think the most significant achievement of Solidarność was its ability to unite all sectors of society."
"It was not possible without a moral revival, without the spiritual dimension of which a Polish pope became the embodiment, reminder and inspiration."
"The important message of Solidarność's victory remains how to find both strength and balance in the passionate quest for justice and the eternal spiritual values of Europe."
"Listening to this message would probably help us to overcome the crisis of European identity, of which there was talk today, because Solidarność has become part of our European identity."
"We have an opportunity to decide on celebrating 31 August as a day of freedom and solidarity, but another date of European significance needs to be remembered."
"On 23 August, the date on which the Nazi-Soviet Pact was signed in 1939, we should commemorate the victims of both communism and Nazism."
"Only then will the famous slogan, 'Never again', also apply to the victims of communism."
"I have received four motions for resolutions(1), tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Solidarity is not exclusively part of Poland’s heritage."
"Solidarity, together with its values and ethos, should become part of the heritage of the whole of Europe and indeed of the whole of the world."
"That is precisely why it is important for Solidarity to become a permanent feature of our European consciousness."
"As stated in our resolutions, 25 years ago the workers of Gdańsk opened a new chapter in the European struggle for bread and freedom."
"It was the workers of Poznań, where I come from, who actually launched the struggle 49 years ago."
"On 28 June 1956 several dozen of them died at the hands of Communists."
"They died because they demanded bread and freedom."
"Fortunately neither their deaths, nor the deaths of the workers who died in December 1970, were in vain."
"Solidarity has global significance because it was a peaceful movement but also a victorious one."
"Solidarity's story inspires optimism and confidence, as it proved that even a Communist totalitarian regime could be brought down without the use of force."
"It would be wonderful if Solidarity's methods and values became an effective way in which all people living under oppressive regimes could fight for freedom, dignity and human rights."
"Solidarity demonstrated that it makes sense to hope for a better life, and that perseverance and belief in one's principles will bear fruit."
"I am convinced that the European Union of 25 Member States would not exist today if Lech Wałęsa and his companions had not acted as they did 25 years ago."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0257/2005) by Mr Radwan, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions (COM(2004)0486 C6-0141/2004 2004/0155(COD)), and also on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions (COM(2004)0486 C6-0144/2004 2004/0159(COD))."
", . Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Alexander Radwan and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the excellent work done on this dossier."
"Let me stress that the work on the Capital Requirements Directive has been a very good example of efficient cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Considering the complexity of the issues involved, I think this has been a real achievement."
"A state-of-the-art accepted supervisory framework for both credit institutions and investment firms is important for the financial stability of the European market and in creating a level playing field, not just within the European Union, but across the global financial community compared to those countries also following the Basel II process."
"Our proposal has been prepared in close cooperation with Member States and the finance industry and was subject to extensive consultation."
"It is in line with the Basel II Accord, but takes account of European specificities where necessary."
"Even the latest proposals for the treatment of trading-related activities will be included."
"This proposal provides a regulatory framework for financial activities in the EU."
"It improves the supervisory regime currently in place, which is primarily based on regulatory capital requirements."
"The new regime will have a solid basis of three pillars."
"Firstly, more risk-sensitive regulatory capital requirements, which are closer in line with banks’ own practices; secondly, an enhanced supervisory review process to ensure a closer fit of these new requirements; and, thirdly, disclosure requirements which improve transparency and market discipline."
"This proposal represents a move to an altogether more sophisticated and refined approach to supervision and risk management."
"By adopting this proposal, the EU will be the first international organization to implement the new Basel II framework."
"This will be a major step towards better banking supervision and will foster greater effectiveness of the European financial markets."
"Let me now turn to the comitology issue."
"As we all know, this debate is linked to the wider question of the powers of the Council and the European Parliament in the comitology procedures."
"We need to make sure that the legislative process does not come to a halt."
"I do not believe that our citizens and the industry would understand that important legislative proposals, such as those on the table today, are taken hostage on account of an issue such as comitology – important as it may be."
"We need to find a pragmatic way to ensure a smooth legislative conclusion to the comitology provisions in the Capital Requirements Directive."
"I welcome the efforts made by the European Parliament and the Council to find agreement on this issue."
"I think we all agree that adoption in first reading of this directive is in the interest of all three institutions and it is also what the marketplace wants."
"Comitology being a general issue, we must look at it in its general context."
"The Commission submitted a proposal for a modification of the 1999 Comitology Decision in 2002, followed by an amended proposal in 2004."
"This proposal already took into account important elements requested by the European Parliament, in particular that the European Parliament and the Council should be put on an equal footing as regards their powers in the comitology procedures."
"It is in large part thanks to the persistence of Parliament, and of your rapporteur in particular, that the Council will now take up work on revising the Comitology Decision, using the Commission’s revised proposal as a basis."
"I welcome the initiative taken by the Presidency to set up a ‘Friends of the Presidency’ group to launch the discussion on the Commission proposal in the Council."
"This is an important step forward."
"The European Parliament must confirm urgently whether its support of the Commission proposal still holds and if not, identify clearly what it wants to achieve."
"The Commission stands ready to cooperate both with Parliament and the Council to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion on this delicate matter as soon as possible."
"Let me make only a few more specific points."
"I understand the European Parliament’s interest in creating a much stronger sense of urgency with regard to the question of its powers to supervise the Commission’s exercise of its implementing powers."
"But introducing a sunset clause, coming into force on 1 January 2007, would be too short."
"There is a serious danger that such a drastic reduction in the duration of the sunset clause would send a wrong and dangerous signal to the marketplace that the adoption of the necessary implementing measures could become highly uncertain."
"The Council has indicated that a period of at least two years is acceptable."
"In the light of the discussions that have taken place, the Commission considers that this is a viable period."
"The introduction of such a reduced period for implementing powers – much shorter than the normal period of four years – clearly emphasizes the need urgently to find a solid, lasting and balanced solution for the supervision of the Commission’s implementing powers by both branches of the legislative authority."
"All institutions must work together to reach this solution as quickly as possible."
"In this regard, the Commission notes that in the first half of 2007, the first sunset clauses under the so-called Lamfalussy process will start suspending the Commission’s implementing powers for two directives - the Conglomerates Directive on 11 February 2007 and the Market Abuse Directive on 12 April 2007."
"While the Commission lives by the commitments made by the then President, Romano Prodi, and my predecessor Frits Bolkestein, when the European Parliament approved the Lamfalussy process, the Commission understands that a renewal of its implementing powers for those directives would be problematic in the absence of an overall solution on comitology."
"This very fact should motivate all institutions to make progress."
"Failure to agree would not only spoil the spirit of cooperation between the institutions, it would also be detrimental to the further development of an integrated financial services market, which relies heavily on the availability of executive powers within the context of framework legislation agreed by codecision."
"I would also add that other policy areas would be affected from a lack of agreement on comitology."
"Before concluding, I would like to reiterate my call on both Parliament and the Council to work constructively towards a solution."
"The Commission from its side will assist wherever it can to ensure that the sense of urgency that is now being given to this matter does not evaporate."
"The Commission has long recognized the need for a solution to be found and I believe that the conditions are now ripe for this."
"I look forward to hearing your comments."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is for once no mere formality that I start by thanking my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs and all members of the Committee for having made it possible for us all to work together on this directive in a constructive manner."
"I would also like to thank the Commission for working with us over recent years – for this draft did not come into being overnight – and enabling us to make progress."
"I see this as being, perhaps, a good example of how we can work together on making laws in the future."
"This evening, I would like, at the outset, to point out a fly in the ointment."
"I agree with the Chairman of our Committee that we are engaged in making laws that will have far-reaching effects on Europe’s financial sector and small and medium-sized businesses, and, speaking on behalf of our President, I would remind you, Mr President, and the Bureau too, that this House possesses full legislative powers in this area."
"Perhaps you could look through the agendas for this week and find another subject, another position where we adopt acts under the codecision procedure, unless you really do think that everything we discuss this week is of high priority."
"I refer here also to the Doorn report, which also has to do with Parliament’s full legislative powers."
"In dealing with this directive, Parliament has always emphasised that it is important to us that certain areas be made Basel-compatible."
"Basel is an international agreement."
"We have always seen the small business sector as important."
"It was always important to us that there should, in this regulatory framework, be special arrangements made for small banks, in order that they should not be squeezed out of the competition; take for example the partial application, or the demand in the report that banks opting in future for the Standardised Approach, should not be discriminated against by the national supervisory bodies."
"Another example I would give is that of the granularity agreed on in Basel and present in the Commission proposal, but which is absent from Parliament’s resolution and must not be re-inserted through the back door."
"I would point out that this needs also to be transposed by the national parliaments and incorporated into supervisory practice."
"There are a number of new things in this directive that will change financial supervision in Europe, for example the Lead Supervisor System, under which one supervisor can overrule another when approving internal ratings, and which puts us on the way to a European market."
"Another example, and one on which there was a great deal of consensus in this House, was the disclosure of ratings, which is of particular importance to small and medium-sized businesses, and I am grateful to the Council for eventually accepting Parliament’s proposed compromise on this."
"There was lengthy discussion of intergroup exposuresI maintained from the very outset that banks’ internal loans should receive equal treatment based on the risks involved, for this document is about risk rather than competition."
"It is because different structures already exist in Europe that we should not prescribe structures for this, for we cannot say that one is better than another."
"We must, though, weigh up their merits."
"Here, too, we have come up with a compromise, and so we have achieved a good result as regards the substance."
"Comitology is a weak point and will remain one."
"I want to emphasise that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has always given the Lamfalussy procedure’s comitology its backing, believing this to be right and important in terms of quick legislation that meets the needs of the market, but we had always considered the former Lamfalussy agreement in the light of a future constitution, by providing for a callback mechanism."
"Today, we need no new debate on the Constitution, but if, in future, we come to draft more directives using Lamfalussy comitology, we will need to conclude a new agreement on the subject to secure Parliament’s rights by providing that, where we delegate them, we can also ‘call them back’, by which I mean better scrutiny, more options for definitions and also the general withdrawal of the delegated power if things start to go wrong."
"As I will not be able to take the floor when we discuss the Doorn report, let me briefly say that there is one area that is excluded from its resolution."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will, though, in future, be responsible for the International Accounting Standards."
"As I see it, though, even if this is not what we decide tomorrow, this agreement should also include the international convention on accounting standards."
"It is not acceptable that, in the future, international bodies should define standards and that these should be implemented without scrutiny by this House."
"Let me just remind the House that we had a visit some time ago from some people from the Board of the IAS, who informed us that they were working on standards for SMEs."
"We will not – and I say this not least for the Commission’s benefit – accept these standards without the necessary scrutiny."
"I hope we are on the right track here, and, to the Presidency, I would say that I hope that it will take on board the compromises we have put forward today."
"I am optimistic, not only as regards the date for the sunset clause, but also as regards the recitals, about our chances of achieving a good compromise this week and that we will succeed in our aim of getting this adopted at first reading."
"What I hear from many Member States is that they are doing these things already, and I believe we are on the right track towards achieving this."
"It is down to the Council."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Legal Affairs welcomes the compromise that the rapporteur has hammered out."
"The author of the position expresses her support for most of the objectives and the need for the updating of the provisions to take account of the considerable progress that has been made in the techniques of risk assessment and financial services management, while also proposing amendments that might help to simplify the system of equity capital requirements."
"A number of amendments have to do with national discretion, which is to be removed for the sake of greater regulatory harmonisation in the internal market."
"I might add that many of these deletions have been recommended to the national supervisory bodies."
"The draftsman of the opinion also takes the view that it was very definitely the right thing to do to take Article 47(2) of the EC Treaty as the basis for this proposal."
"As a directive is the instrument best suited to achieving the desired objectives, the principle of subsidiarity is complied with, as is the principle of proportionality, since the directive goes no further than doing that which is absolutely necessary."
"I would like to add a number of comments on comitology from the point of view not only of the Legal Affairs Committee, but also of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and will be commenting on them later on."
"As financial markets and banks are liable to undergo rapid change, with new products and combinations of products constantly having to be developed, the law on banking and banking supervision must also be capable of being further developed."
"Basel II must not be allowed to degenerate into a framework from which one chooses the financial instruments one fancies, but must instead never lose sight of the need to protect creditors, investors and consumers."
"The dialogue between legislators, supervisors and banks, both at national and European level, referred to in the Lamfalussy procedure can also help to keep supervision appropriate to the function concerned."
"I will enlarge on this point later on."
"Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to our Chamber."
"My role in this debate consists exclusively of explaining what has happened in this Parliament during comitology and expressing my full support for the position of the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Radwan."
"The problems in relation to comitology began some years ago now, when the Commission presented Parliament with the financial services action plan, which proposed the rapid implementation of forty-something measures in the field of financial services."
"We were told at that point that the ordinary legislative procedure was too slow to keep up to date with the speed of the financial markets."
"I spoke here to say that, in the vast majority of cases, Parliament was not responsible for this delay, but rather the Council."
"The next step was what we know as the Lamfalussy report, after the person in charge of drawing it up, who, with a view to providing a solution, to adapting the speed of the procedure to the speed of the markets, proposed splitting the legislation into two levels."
"First level: general principles, basic guidelines."
"Second level: concrete legal rules."
"Level one, codecision."
"Level two, complete exclusion of Parliament."
"We were asked to surrender the prerogatives that should be the privileges, the basic rules, of any European Parliament."
"It is quite understandable that the European Parliament should express its suspicion."
"We simply wanted to be in the same position as the Council."
"In the event that boundaries were overstepped, in the event that the attorney did not keep to the limits of their mandate, we wanted a call-back."
"It was not possible at that time, because the Treaties did not allow it, and we were waiting for the Constitution."
"We have reached a transitional situation — and I would stress transitional — and I would therefore call for the sunset clause that Mr Radwan has mentioned."
"Until then it will be necessary to reach an agreement that harmonises the two objectives: speed in the legislative procedure and respect for Parliament’s powers, powers which, as is the case for any Parliament, have been hard won over time."
"I would like finally to explain our suspicion by recalling a Spanish politician renowned for his skill and ability in fiddling the rules, who said, ‘you make the law, but leave it to me to make the regulation’."
"That is the danger we are worried about."
"Mr President, let me start by saying ‘thank you’ to the rapporteur for the willingness to cooperate that he has demonstrated, which enabled Social Democrats’ main concerns to be accommodated."
"We believe that banking supervision must be internationally agreed and of the same kind throughout the EU, and that, in particular the banks’ equity capital required by law must be more rigorously adjusted to take account of commercial risks."
"It is only in this way that the savers can be put in a more secure position and their savings safeguarded against the event of their bank failing."
"Modern banks both manage private households’ assets and keep their accounts, while also being their advisers and agents on the financial markets."
"The economic efficiency of the finance they provide and of the capital they invest is dependent on their remaining competitive."
"The finance they provide plays an important part in the further development of the EU through its infrastructure, housebuilding, municipalities, energy industry and, not least, its small and medium-sized business."
"Basel II includes objective points of reference for assessing the risks involved in providing this finance, along with the banks’ associated equity capital costs and the interest charged to debtors."
"This picture is completed by the adoption of my amendments on easier retail credit for SMEs and the liability of regional and local authorities in the computation of the risk element."
"Basel II should not, then, result in finance becoming harder to come by or more expensive."
"The banks also bear an economic responsibility, and Basel II must not be misused as an excuse to the detriment of debtors or at their expense."
"Basel II is also intended to create a level playing field for competition between the big banking groups and the savings banks and credit unions that operate on a regional basis, and it was for that reason that I pressed for the greatest possible objectivity in the treatment of what are termed inter-bank loans."
"I would like, not least, to highlight what is now the dual responsibility of the national supervisory agencies as regards both the monitoring of the banks’ more precise risk assessment methods and supporting banks that operate in more than one country when the supervisory authorities in both countries cooperate with one another."
"Last but not least, I would like to revisit the subject of comitology."
"The rules on information and transparency that Parliament is demanding for Basel II are actually taken for granted in modern legislation, and that should also be reflected in the right of recall."
"What we want from the Council is a guarantee that, in two years’ time at the latest, there will be a solid agreement enabling Parliament to continue to exercise its democratic rights and responsibilities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the object of this draft directive is the implementation of Basel II in the European Union, thereby establishing a basis on which the financial markets may be made more stable."
"Banking supervision can be made more efficient and greater weight attached to the risk element involved."
"The directive will also impose minimum standards for high-risk businesses."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we have discussed Basel II in depth and worked our way through some 900 amendments, along with a whole array of compromise amendments that the rapporteur, Mr Radwan, drafted together with Mr Ettl and myself."
"I would like at this point to express my gratitude for the high degree of trust in all this and for the constructive cooperation that we enjoyed."
"In the ensuing troika discussions, the Council accepted many of Parliament’s amendments, and we managed to extract several concessions and compromises from it, with the effect that the technical substance of Basel II can be regarded as balanced."
"Speaking as a Liberal, I am particularly glad that we have managed to come up with rules that are capable of ensuring fair competitive conditions between the various groups in the banking sector."
"This is a package that the Liberals and Democrats can strongly endorse."
"It does, however include two amendments on Islamic loans and mortgages, and one on energy companies, to which we cannot give our backing, for Basel II was not intended to be used as a means of putting in place special safeguards for certain sectors of industry or creating special conditions for them."
"Despite that, we will, as a group, be voting in favour of the whole package."
"It was our group that introduced the amendments relating to the trading book We see it as a very good thing that the good and fast work done by the Commission has now made it possible for these to be adopted in the course of the voting on Basel II, thus ensuring consistent implementation in this area."
"Discussion of Basel II has of course touched on the subject of comitology, something about which all speakers have already had something to say."
"The importance and usefulness of the comitology procedure is not a matter of dispute for any of us; it is a means whereby the rules implementing basic acts may be speedily enacted, but it is a procedure that must not be allowed to undermine Parliament’s prerogatives, for the enhancement of which the Constitutional Treaty makes provision."
"Uncertain though the future of that Treaty may be, Parliament’s concerns still matter and are still relevant."
"As was only to be expected, the troika negotiations on comitology proved to be particularly problematic."
"Weeks of pressure on our part prompted the Council to create a working party called ‘Friends of the Presidency’, which Commissioner McCreevy mentioned, thereby acknowledging for the first time the need for a new inter-institutional agreement and for action to be taken."
"We cannot, though, be satisfied with mere promises."
"What we want is a definite date by which there will be a new inter-institutional agreement to reinforce our rights"
"To the Council, we propose 1 January 2008 as the date for the sunset clause, and now await its response, which we hope will turn out to be favourable."
". Mr President, capital requirements are regarded as useful in preventing bank failure because they make shareholders bear more of the cost of failure."
"The international Basel II proposals, which this directive implements, are designed to achieve a better match between capital and risk than the simple 8% capital asset ratio of Basel I. However, no amount of bank capital, short of 100% of risk assets, can safeguard against failure."
"The minimum amounts of capital specified in any regulatory scheme are arbitrary."
"As Mr Radwan stressed, other problems are the extent to which risk-spreading amongst individual banks of a banking group should imply a reduction in regulatory capital, and the difficulty of defining the division of responsibility across national supervisors."
"There are no objective answers to those vexed questions."
"For that reason I question the competence of this Parliament in this field."
"It is ridiculous that we should be involved in the minutiae of this directive given how complex and yet how important it is."
"But this is how Parliament works, with all of us Members, however experienced or inexperienced in the arcane arts of banking regulation, expected to make hundreds of reasoned judgments on questions, many of which cannot be answered in any objective way."
"The rapporteur recommends that, owing to doubt, this directive should be reviewed in the future."
"The banking industry does not need that."
"Banks spend their time dealing with risk and uncertainty."
"Adding further uncertainty over future regulation will not help them to plan or look after our interests as customers and shareholders."
"The bottom line is that there is no right amount of regulatory capital."
"If we kept that in mind when legislating, we would come up with rules that are a great deal simpler, and the Members of this Parliament would be spared from the farcical exercise of voting on hundreds of amendments."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Radwan, for his timely report."
"The financial services sector has become very sophisticated at risk management and so the regulatory framework has to respond to the times."
"I am very satisfied with the report on the table today."
"It acknowledges the fact that covered bonds are a global capital markets product and are no longer either a European or domestic product."
"I believe that any alternative to that would handicap the development of the sector, which has significant commercial potential."
"According to a study conducted by JP Morgan, Basel II could increase the number of high-yield bonds – and especially covered bonds – being issued."
"That would be advantageous from an Irish perspective because Irish covered bond issues have the highest credit rating."
"Therefore it is important that Basel II upholds current market practice in the covered bond area."
"Banks have a long history of lending money and we sometimes take it for granted that they are fully prepared for the traditional risks such as credit and market risks."
"However, nowadays banks are facing increasingly unpredictable operational risks, which are difficult to manage."
"Under Basel II it would become essential that risks analytics are timely assigned to financial services operations."
"It would be interesting to know what the expenditure of financial services institutions will be on analytics in the EU after the introduction of Basel II."
"Therefore I welcome the proposed review of this regulation after four years."
"At the same time, however, it would be unwise to underestimate the importance of risk management in the traditional areas of credit and market risks."
"In today's economic climate there is a growing need for detailed analysis of the effects of recession and other financial shocks on national economies and the EU."
"Under the standards set by Basel II the banking sector will have to invest in the development of IT systems capable of modelling in-depth credit risk analysis."
"The way in which financial services are conducted has changed and will continue to change."
"However successful risk management cannot be solely based on a compulsory reply to regulations."
"It requires a sound understanding of what is good for business and the standard of best practice."
"Mr President, for many small and medium-sized businesses, Basel II is a matter of life and death."
"They worry a great deal about it; there has been a great deal of discussion about it."
"I believe that they should have complete confidence in the rapporteur."
"Even though his report has accomplished many things, there is one aspect I would like to mention in the short speaking time available to me, and that is that whether there really will be fair competition among sources of credit, and then perhaps also among those who apply for it, will be dependent on what is agreed in this House."
"It is fortunate that we are only at first reading stage."
"I do think, though, that Amendment 140, which is an attempt to introduce more transparency by calling on the credit institutions to provide the SMEs and other firms that have applied for loans with written clarification of how they arrived at their rating decisions, will be essential if the market is not to be even more distorted."
"We will then have to wait and see what comes out at the other end – the right degree of transparency or excessive regulation."
"It would be nice if we could lay down a timeframe for this, at least at second reading."
"I would certainly be in favour of a sunset clause, about which everything has in any case already been said, and I hope that Mr Radwan’s report gets through in such a shape as to maintain the balance he is seeking."
"Mr President, I too should like to compliment Mr Radwan on the extremely able way in which he has steered this complex directive to this advanced stage."
"We all hope that the Council of Ministers will now be able to take the steps needed to make a first reading agreement possible."
"Surely the Presidency can make a supreme effort and undertake to reach a conclusion on the comitology issue to a mutually agreeable timescale. So much has been agreed on the complex, technical issues that it would surely be a shame – in fact, an absurd embarrassment – not to close the remaining gap."
"It is surely reasonable for Parliament to aspire to a role in the legislative process which is equivalent to that of the other branch of the legislature – the Council."
"Our constituents expect that."
"Indeed most of them assume that is already the case."
"All that we ask is for the Council to assess that aspiration with dispatch."
"The industry needs timely legal certainty and will not readily forgive either of us – Parliament or the Council – if in the face of all common sense we allow this important directive to fail for what might appear to the outside world to be interinstitutional niceties."
"I now turn to international considerations."
"Almost every European banking, insurance and asset management business will be affected by this new regime and will have to shoulder the costs of adjusting their systems."
"In America, on the other hand, only the largest international banks will have to comply."
"The competitive benefits will probably induce at least some of their medium-sized competitors to adopt Basel II too."
"However, even the smaller European financial institutions will have to comply and bear quite substantial financial costs in so doing, while their American competitors, such as asset management firms, will not have to."
"How will the Commission ensure a level playing field for our financial institutions of all shapes and sizes in the global marketplace?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us an agreement at first reading on a text that could scarcely be more complex, in the context of which 304 amendments will be easily adopted."
"That is, if Parliament can work intelligently when it has to."
"That being said, what is at stake in the text, as everyone can see, is absolutely huge."
"The text strikes a balance between an approach sensitive to risk and one that is sensitive to real challenges in terms of competition, whether within or outside the Europe Union."
"I will make three remarks."
"The first is that, as regards the content of this text, any aspects enabling us to assess and take better account of the risks taken by the banking sector – and, more generally, by the financial institutions sector – are steps in the right direction, insofar as they are backed up by reasonable consolidation and, above all, with the implementation of effective supervision mechanisms."
"That is the entire debate we have had on the size of the banks, the internal group consolidations and risk evaluation."
"I believe that, behind the way in which this matter is handled, the issue of knowing how to implement a lead supervisor at European level remains altogether crucial, and we will have to return to it over the next few years."
"I have one word to say on the subject of SMEs: I dare to hope that the solution proposed is a step in the right direction and that it will not, on the contrary, lead to a shortage of credit for SMEs."
"The debate is open, but I personally have my doubts on this matter."
"The second point I wish to make, which my fellow Member, Mr Purvis, spoke of just now, concerns international relations."
"I know, Commissioner, that you attach great importance to them and, quite frankly, since we have been following this matter, I have been struck by the imbalance that exists in the way the integration and appropriation of the Basel II Agreements are perceived."
"We know what role the Americans have played in defining, and conducting negotiations on, Basel II, and today we are witnessing a large question mark hanging over the schedule for, and the scope of, this agreement on the other side of the Atlantic."
"Behind all of that, a challenge in terms of competition for our economies exists that we cannot overlook, and we are counting on your vigilance in order to prevent this from leading to a situation that results in the European Union being discriminated against."
"My final point concerns the issue of comitology, which all my fellow Members have spoken about."
"Firstly, the Commissioner told us: ‘Let us not take these agreements hostage because the markets would not understand’."
"Yet as you know, the markets do as they please."
"They will say to us today: ‘It is imperative that you adopt this text."
"If you do not, it will be a disaster’, and then tomorrow, when they disagree with the way in which you have implemented Level I of the agreement, they will come to see us and they will then be quite happy that a Parliament exists where people can re-examine the way in which the comitology measures have been adequately or inadequately implemented."
"Let us not listen too hard, therefore, to what the markets have to say and let us do our job as legislator."
"My final point will be to express my delight that the UK Presidency has implemented a Friends of the Presidency Group."
"I believe that that is a good way of finding an agreement."
"I simply regret the fact that the Council is not here to participate in this important discussion in the debate between the institutions."
"Mr President, the Capital Requirements Directive updates a recurrent conflict of aims in EU cooperation, a conflict of aims that we all have reason, as a matter of principle, to analyse and debate before we adopt a position."
"On the one hand, there are often good reasons for introducing common rules at EU level if the internal market is to operate efficiently."
"Differing rules between one Member State and another in crucial areas entail high costs and, thus, less prosperity."
"That also applies to the financial market."
"On the other hand, there are strong reasons for not forcing the Member States to adopt common rules that then become part of our and thus prevent individual countries from taking the lead and developing systems of rules."
"A large part of our economies’ dynamic is based upon the institutional competition we have between countries when it comes to developing efficient and growth-promoting institutions."
"Often, expressions such as best practice and benchmarking are used, reflecting knowledge of this important process."
"Unfortunately, this Chamber devotes little or no attention to institutional competition."
"Where Basel II is concerned, we are, however, talking about an extremely global market involving an extremely well-informed group of actors who can take action at a moment’s notice."
"In this market, there is little scope for special positions at EU level."
"When it comes to Basel II, individual countries should operate independently within the framework of this cooperation between central banks."
"There is really no reason for mixing the EU and this Parliament up in that process."
"We are not designed for that purpose."
"Allow me finally to agree with other speakers about how unfortunate it is that Parliament is trying to use this report as part of the constant institutional power struggle between the EU’s institutions."
"The June List does not wish to help strengthen this Parliament’s power."
"Mr President, I understand that I can also use Mr Goebbels’ speaking time."
"As a number of Members have already had something to say about the content of this dossier, I do not propose to say too much about it;"
"I would, though, like to say something about the procedure, but not before getting something off my chest."
"To outsiders, this is an impenetrable technical dossier with no fewer than 800 amendments or thereabouts; a document at least 10 cm thick."
"You would be forgiven for wondering what Brussels is up to."
"Where is the indignation, where are the critical articles in the press?"
"Then again, this is not about the protection of workers against skin cancer through exposure to too much sunlight – a subject about which everyone has an opinion and which, in the previous part-session, came in for denunciation from every quarter ."
"No, this time round, it is about the protection of invested capital."
"Is this, then, in some way, an entirely different and nobler goal?"
"Is this, then, something in which Europe is allowed to be closely involved?"
"No selective indignation this time round, then."
"Fortunately, that is also true for me: I have nothing against this dossier, but let us, in future, not apply different standards when it comes to protecting workers."
"I would now like to turn to the report."
"I am pleased and also proud that we have managed to prepare this complex dossier, including the added rules for the trading book, so quickly and efficiently in our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, something on which all those involved deserve many congratulations."
"This determination is something which the United States, in particular, is following with a measure of astonishment and jealousy."
"That is what we need in order to make Europe competitive and attract investments for growth and employment; that is what matters in the Lisbon Strategy."
"The way in which we are going about this, though, with this plethora of amendments and technical appendices, is not an approach that appeals to me, nor do I believe that we will thereby achieve better regulation."
"We have in the financial markets regulations just developed a more intelligent working method referred to as the Lamfalussy procedure."
"According to this procedure, framework legislation is adopted by the EU institutions whilst technical details are delegated to the different committees in the comitology and to the European groups of supervisors who, in turn, delegate in very close dialogue and consultation with market operators and other stakeholders."
"Not only is this necessary in order to lessen the burden on employers, but also enable a much more flexible and adequate response to the developments in these dynamic markets."
"I am a forthright advocate of this approach and believe that we can use it to find effective solutions for better regulations in other areas too."
"Paradoxically, we have not yet applied the Lamfalussy method to this capital adequacy directive, but are now laying down everything, including the appendices and mathematical formulas, at the level of legislators as a group."
"Instead, we would prefer, after the directive has entered into effect, to tie the possibility of injecting this dynamism and flexibility into the directive to conditions and to a deadline."
"I would like to make it clear that that is not, I repeat not, because we are opposed to the method, but because a fundamental condition is still missing from the Lamfalussy procedure, and by that I mean Parliament’s call-back right."
"I think that that should be spelled out once more, which is what we intended to do in this directive in order to crank up the pressure so as to obtain this formal call-back right."
"We do not care how this is done."
"The problem was around back in 1999, before the conventions were introduced to prepare treaty changes, and there now has to be a structural solution to the problem."
"The ball is in the Council’s court, and we hope that the ECOFIN ministers will make it clear to their General Affairs and Foreign Affairs counterparts that a solution must be found, come what may."
"I think that that should be the key message coming out of this discussion."
"Mr President, I willingly join others in thanking the rapporteur, who has finally been able to demonstrate a sufficient ability to listen in order to reach an agreement which, while not to everyone’s satisfaction, is to the satisfaction of a large number of us."
"The highly technical nature of this directive could not disguise its fundamental character; the implementation of the Basel II Agreements at Community level is absolutely crucial for the banking industry in Europe."
"Alongside other fellow Members, I have fought to oppose a logic of extreme harmonisation in the field of mortgage lending, and I am delighted to have won my case."
"The mortgage lending market, which is a German concept, is booming, particularly since the euro was introduced."
"With a sum of around EUR 1 600 billion, it is the largest sector of private lending."
"The fact is that maintaining the provisions that were initially envisaged would have meant bringing this activity - which involves the main financial centres of the European Union: London, Dublin, Paris and Luxembourg - to an abrupt end."
"Covered bonds are one of the rare European products that Americans envy us; let us not turn them into an instrument doomed to obsolescence by applying overly restrictive criteria preventing the banks from using them for the purpose for which they are intended."
"As mortgage bonds feature among the most secure financial instruments and benefit from the highest bond ratings, no one would have understood if we had headed towards a state of inflexibility and not allowed any leeway with regard to national regulation."
"The definition of mortgage bonds and the collateralisation threshold have, therefore, finally been put together in such a way as to be compatible with the existing items of legislation."
"That decision was necessary, even though I regret the fact that, in terms of lost given defaults, the directive goes far beyond what is required, with rates well above the losses that are, in fact, absorbed by the credit institutions."
"I will conclude by making two remarks."
"Firstly, I note once again that the consolidation and harmonisation approach leads to a dead end."
"Let us not confuse the need for a common framework with egalitarianism."
"Secondly, the dialogue with the financial stakeholders can be conducted in complete transparency and to everyone’s satisfaction."
"Mr President, I wish firstly to thank Mr Radwan and also congratulate him on the major, complicated and important piece of work he has done."
"If there is any area in which we see the importance of European cooperation, it is in this area in which we are creating a large financial market."
"To my Swedish fellow Member who spoke previously, I should like to say that, if we did not have European cooperation, we should not have the opportunity to exercise democratic and parliamentary control over the regulations designed here."
"We now have stability, efficiency and predictability in the common financial markets."
"The directive will also entail more flexible risk assessment which – and this is important to remember – is basically good for European consumers and businesses."
"What is important, as has been mentioned previously in this Chamber, is that it also entails identical ground rules in the global market and in relation to the American market."
"It is also important, however, that it means identical ground rules in another sense, whereby we shall see new, developing financial institutions in the dynamic financial markets."
"In the same way as we have seen a convergence between banks and insurance companies in recent decades, we shall see new products and new structures."
"It is important, then, that this directive should not in practice hamper dynamic development in the market but enable new forms of business to develop and compete on equal conditions."
"It will be an important task for the Commission, as for the debate here in Parliament, to follow up developments in precisely this sense."
"I am grateful that we have been able to obtain transitional rules that give the national authorities the opportunity to affirm this development but, once the directive is properly in place and its rules applicable, it will be one of Parliament’s and the Commission’s tasks to ensure that there is an openness to change that positively accepts the variability of the financial markets."
"Otherwise, we shall become less competitive in Europe."
"That is why this is an important task."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, Basel II has become a byword for the way in which it becomes more difficult to get credit the more problematic the situation one is in."
"Had Basel II been accepted in its original form, that would of course be an extraordinarily bad sign for Europe’s present economic state, and so I want to express warm thanks to the rapporteur for our group, Mr Radwan, for the extraordinarily difficult job he has done in this regard."
"I see this directive, in the form in which it is presented in his report for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, as providing us with an excellent means of dispelling the fears of small and medium-sized businesses."
"The second point I want to pick up is the same as that addressed by Mrs Berès."
"It does not often happen that I agree with her, but on this occasion and in this matter I do."
"It is astonishing that the American banking sector, from which this directive was originally derived, is now delaying its application to the smaller American banks."
"Great believer in the trans-Atlantic relationship though I am, I do think we need to take care that economic harmonisation in Europe does not take us down different roads from those taken on the other side of the Atlantic."
"We will be the strongest economic area in the world only if we make changes at the same pace as they do."
"Let me conclude by expressing my agreement with what Mr Radwan had to say about comitology."
"The right message to send to the many members of the European public who complain that it is not clear who decides what in Europe, is that it is here in the European Parliament that decisions of a political nature are taken, and that is why the sunset clause, which is to be in force for two years, enjoys my support."
"In 2007, there will be three more directives that have gone through the Lamfalussy procedure: the directive on responsibilities in relation to prospectuses, the Market Abuse Directive and the one on financial conglomerates."
"All three will be there, and all three, or so I believe, need to bring clarity and stability to the financial markets."
"This is where the European Parliament can play its part, and so I welcome this directive in the form in which Mr Radwan has presented it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first of all to congratulate Mr Radwan on the quality of his report in a field that is very technical, but crucial for banking."
"The draft directive implements or updates the general security principles of the banking system and, in particular, as regards the solvency of credit institutions."
"Two specific aspects will warrant more in-depth consideration in the future: the division of risks, in order sensibly to control the proportion of regulatory own funds validated by a single signature, and the harmonisation of rules relating to the internal control systems in order to take account of the circumstances of cross-border banking groups."
"In this respect, I would have liked – and I had tabled amendments to this end – more consideration to have been given to the European dimension where cross-border internal group lending and supervision on a consolidated basis were concerned."
"I acknowledge, however, that the draft directive, as amended by Parliament, strikes the greatest balance we could realistically envisage at present between the responsibilities of the regulatory authorities in the home country and of those in the host country with regard to banking groups carrying out cross-border activities."
"In the unfortunate absence of the Constitution, the proposals made by the Council Presidency seem to me pragmatically to preserve the legitimate rights of Parliament."
"For their part, the banks have, over several years, harnessed human, financial and technical resources in order to keep to the deadline."
"The statutory deadline must therefore be retained, whatever questions may be asked by the United States."
"It is important that the directive enter into force on the date scheduled."
"That is why I hope that Parliament adopts the draft submitted to it and that an agreement is reached at first reading."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start by telling the Commission that this is where the work begins."
"Mr Radwan may well have produced a splendid dossier, but what matters is that Commissioner Verheugen should give his attention to the question of how best to introduce this directive in Europe, how to prevent insolvencies and encourage company formations."
"Commissioner Kovács’ homework is, in my view, to give some thought to how, in future, businesses may write off more minor items – the rates in America, for example, are substantially higher – and to how they are to handle the carrying forward and back of losses."
"This is where the Commission should, with competition in mind, intervene creatively, for this Basel II project is, after all, meant to be about rationalisation and reform; it is meant to save costs rather than to bring a whole new wodge of them into play, and for that reason, here too, I recommend benchmarking and best practice."
". Mr President, I thank the Members for their very constructive comments regarding this very important piece of legislation and, as I said at the outset, I congratulate Mr Radwan and the shadow rapporteurs for their work and the deep, intensive and very technical work done by the committee on this complex subject."
"I agree with those speakers who stressed the importance of this particular directive."
"What will be good for the financial institutions will be good for economic growth, employment, the economy and for increased financial stability."
"Sometimes members of the public look at matters relating to banks and financial institutions with rather a jaundiced eye and see them as charging excessive interest and making huge profits at their expense."
"However, if it were not for banks and credit institutions, there would be no great economic success."
"Therefore it is in everybody's interests – including the various actors and stakeholders – that we have a properly regulated financial sector and that risk is properly assessed."
"It is also important for depositors."
"This is the flipside of lending, since, if no one placed money in banks, there would be no money to lend."
"For the very same reasons, it is also important for shareholders and investors."
"It is also important for the employees of the financial institutions."
"Therefore, what will be good for the banking sector will be good for us all."
"A recent study estimated that banks would have reduced capital requirements of about EUR 80 to 120 billion as a result of the proposed directive."
"It is also said that this directive will reduce the capital requirements for loans to SMEs by more than 50%."
"This Parliament has tabled amendments to our proposals that improve the rules for retail and SME lending still further."
"Some speakers referred to the question of Islamic mortgages."
"We need rules to ensure that such loans do not fall between the cracks and escape regulation altogether."
"Mr Ryan and Mrs Lulling raised questions about mortgage bonds or asset-covered bonds."
"I note that the further flexibility introduced by Parliament's amendments will reduce regulatory constraints for so-called covered bonds still further and this is a good result for the markets."
"Some other Members – in particular Mrs Berès and Mr Purvis – raised the question of a level playing field for Europe and the United States."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that the small and medium-sized American banks have asked for the benefits of Basle II also to be extended to them and I understand that the United States is on the verge of making such proposals within the next month."
"Secondly, as regards this level playing field, all the big American banks which are in direct competition with European globally-operating banks will be covered by the Basle framework."
"I take on board, however, what Mr Purvis and Mrs Berès said, not only in this particular regard, but also in other areas relating to the United States."
"I know that Mrs Berès has taken a particularly keen interest in this matter and it is something that I bear in mind."
"Just about every speaker referred to the general question of comitology."
"Mr Radwan can take particular pleasure and pride in having brought this issue to the forefront of the debate and in having extended it into other areas as well."
"As regards comitology, I note with satisfaction that the rapporteur is putting forward a helpful and constructive proposal here and I hope that, not only with this directive but in other areas as well, we can bring the matter to a successful conclusion, with the cooperation of the various actors."
"I am also pleased to inform you that the Commission can fully support the compromise which has been reached on these amendments."
"The package which is now before the plenary is a fair compromise, taking into account the discussions between the Council and Parliament, and it will also enjoy the strong support of the banking industry."
"Furthermore, the solutions proposed are well-balanced and respect the Commission's initial intentions for this legislation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Mr Doorn, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on statutory audit of annual accounts and consolidated accounts and amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC [COM(2004)0177 C6-0005/2004 2004/0065(COD)] (A6-0224/2005)."
". Mr President, I would like to thank Bert Doorn, and the Legal Affairs Committee, for the excellent work done on this dossier."
"Efficient cooperation between the institutions should make it possible to adopt this proposal in a single reading."
"Statutory audit is a very important subject for Europe."
"Recent scandals highlighted the need to reply to new challenges."
"In order to modernise statutory audit, the revised directive will clarify the duties of statutory auditors, their independence and their ethics."
"It will also require the application of international standards on auditing and will set the criteria for robust public oversight of the audit profession."
"We must have proper auditors in the EU."
"This benefits everyone: the companies themselves, investors and savers, both large and small."
"Economic confidence will grow."
"Let me just say a few words on the question of limiting auditor liability."
"This question has arisen during debates on this directive, although it was not in the Commission’s original proposal."
"Auditors are wary of taking on new audits because they are afraid of unlimited liability."
"I can see the arguments in favour of acting at EU level, as there could potentially be an impact on the internal market."
"I intend to work actively to see what can be done in this regard."
"As a first step, I intend to launch a study in the near future."
"The proposed amendments take account of the discussions in the Council, and also enjoy strong support from the audit industry."
"The solutions proposed by your rapporteur are, furthermore, well balanced and respect the Commission’s initial intentions with this legislation."
"So we strongly support the outcome."
"As was the case with the previous report that we discussed, comitology is once again the only outstanding issue."
"The situation is very similar to what was said in the context of Mr Radwan’s report on the capital requirements directive just a few moments ago."
"I refer to the statements I made in that context so I do not need to repeat myself."
"Implementing powers are very important for the eighth company law directive."
"Many technical issues and adaptations require the availability of comitology powers."
"This was also confirmed by the Council when it expressed its support for the overall compromise package of amendments."
"The Committee of Permanent Representatives considered that a sunset clause under which the implementing powers would be suspended could harm the effective implementation of this directive."
"It therefore asked Parliament to consider the implications of such a sunset clause carefully."
"The Commission shares the concerns expressed by the Council."
"Yet it also recognises Parliament’s view that its role in supervising the exercise of delegated authority must be brought in line with its standing in the codecision procedure."
"Pending an overall solution for comitology, the Commission understands that Parliament would wish to limit the delegated authority in time."
"For the Commission it is essential that this period be long enough to ensure proper implementation of the directive."
"I understand that your rapporteur would propose a sunset clause of two years after the entry into force of the directive, but 1 April 2008 at the latest."
"This would not, however, apply to Article 26, on international auditing standards."
"The Commission can agree with this."
"This solution would correspond with the solution found in Mr Radwan's report on the proposed capital requirements directive."
"The Commission also calls on the Council to show flexibility, but above all to consider the revision of the 1999 comitology decision as a priority."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur for the 8th directive, I can inform you that we have put together an interesting package in the negotiations with the Council and the Commission."
"For example, we managed to create more room for national solutions in audit committees, which are supervisory committees within enterprises."
"We spelled out once more that corporate governance is a matter to be negotiated at Member State level and that it is unacceptable for sweeping solutions in this area to be imposed from the European level."
"We managed to make accountancy rotation the rule and the rotation of accountancy offices an exception."
"We also managed to restrict the administrative burden on the small and medium-sized enterprise in some areas and the Commission has undertaken to present a report on liability before the end of 2006."
"Commissioner McCreevy said a moment ago that he ‘intends to launch a study in the near future’, but we agreed that a report will be on the table before the end of 2006, and I also hope to have his word that that will be done; we would like to exchange views on this matter in this House too."
"Liability is a problem on account of the huge differences between the Member States, but we will need to look for solutions here."
"All in all, it is a vital piece of legislation which, in my view, has become somewhat more pragmatic in the past six months and also more practical in its application, which is, after all, what this is all about."
"There is another big obstacle to negotiate, namely comitology, as you, Commissioner, already pointed out."
"In that respect, we decided in favour of consistency with the Radwan report, as I believe it is the same interests that are at stake."
"Further to a remark made by one Member a moment ago – ‘I do not want to take part in the power games between the institutions’ – I would like to repeat that I do not think this is about power games, but simply a modern way of legislating."
"We must draft framework legislation and delegate the details to the Commission and the experts, but that can only be done provided that Parliament has the call-back right."
"That is what matters most of all."
"I remember that just before the Dutch referendum on the Constitution, which was, as you know, unsuccessful, there was a large article in one of the Dutch newspapers with the headline ‘Officials in Brussels have the power’."
"In actual fact, it referred to the executive committees where legislation of all kinds drafted in this House is implemented behind closed doors."
"That is a typical example that adds to the citizens’ growing dislike for Brussels, where all kinds of things are done behind closed doors."
"I think, therefore, that if we discuss this comitology – and I am pleased that the Council has announced that it intends to develop initiatives – that much will need to be done in order to improve matters on this score."
"In that respect, I endorse the clause setting 1 April 2008 as the ‘sunset’, as also stipulated in the Radwan report."
"I would like to add, though, that with regard to Article 26, which concerns the adoption of the international accountancy standards, we should make an exception, because these involve, in terms of this sunset clause, international agreements."
"Needless to say, if and when a new regulation on comitology is introduced, the call-back right will also need to apply to accountancy standards of this kind."
"On a final note, I would like to thank my fellow members of the committee for the very constructive collaboration."
"I think that our negotiations over the past six months have been very useful."
"I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the constructive attitude, and we can be very satisfied with the results achieved."
". Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, let me thank Mr Doorn for the excellent work he has done with the assistance of many committees."
"I see this report as representing a good compromise on this difficult issue."
"It is evident not least from the number of Members present in the House that this is a highly technical piece of legislation, but I believe it is one that will do a great deal for Europe’s competitiveness, both internal and external."
"This is a sensitive area, and one that calls for watertight legislation."
"There must, of course, be compromises; one that Mr Doorn mentioned has to do with rotation."
"It is, in essence, right that external rotation should go; the Member States have an alternative to it."
"Some of them can retain the external rotation that they had before."
"My basic instinct is to say that the Member States should not be allowed to require external rotation, as I do not believe that it encourages competition."
"As my speaking time is limited, I would like to concentrate on Commissioner McCreevy’s proposal for a study into the likely effects of limited liability on the auditing firms’ internal market."
"The introduction of limited liability would give Europe a definite advantage as a business location, and so I am glad that Commissioner McCreevy has agreed to this study, which needs to be completed soon, that is to say, by the end of 2006."
"A whole array of solutions is available to those Member States that specify a limit on liability; there is, for example, proportional liability, upper limits or a combination of the two."
"What this House wants from the Commission is for the Member States to be able to take their own decisions on liability, and for us in Europe to end up with rules that are harmonious rather than harmonised."
"So, as Mr Doorn has said everything that needs to be said about comitology and I agree with him, I will thank you for your attention and express the hope that the directive gets through."
"Mr President, I believe that the proposal on auditing is a good example of cooperation amongst the different groups in the European Parliament and between Parliament and the other institutions: the Council and the Commission."
"The rapporteur has worked hard to involve us in the drawing up of the text and in his meetings with the Council and the Commission, so that this proposal may contribute to the homogenisation of European legislation in such an important field as auditing, which has caused so much concern amongst the public following the Enron and Parmalat scandals."
"In any event, it will be a minimal framework, for the time being maintaining the competence of the States in areas where they have greater capacity, experience and proximity for the purposes of carrying out inspections."
"Of the most controversial points in the European Commission’s proposal, I would like to place the emphasis on the rotation of firms, auditors and partners, with a view to reducing the possibility of conflicts of interest between the auditors and the audited."
"After much effort we have managed to open the way to the rotation of firms, and not just of partners, by allowing each State to adopt the rotation of auditing firms, that is to say, external rotation, as an alternative."
"Amendments have been accepted in the field of independence."
"I hope that they are shown to be useful in the future, since they guarantee the confidence that the markets require."
"The proposal maintains the same responsibility for auditors as for other professionals."
"I believe that equality of treatment and the security of citizens and clients should be guaranteed in this field."
"Nevertheless, I will confess that I have doubts about the capacity of the new legislation to stimulate an increase in the number of large auditing companies, thereby preventing the problems relating to the oligopoly characterising the sector, to which the Commissioner has referred."
"The Enron case put an end to Arthur Andersen and only four of the so-called big five were left."
"A further scandal leading to a loss of confidence in another large auditing firm could be fatal, not just for the company affected, but also for the stability of the system."
"From the outset, therefore, I have argued that it should not all be left to the auditing firms to control themselves and that we should support control by public authorities, since not only is the viability of a company at stake, but also the health of the financial system."
"I would like once again to congratulate Mr Doorn."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that the Auditors Directive will help to restore the confidence in year-end results and the operation of the markets that has been shattered by various scandals over various years."
"It might well give investors greater security – the security they once enjoyed – and make European businesses more competitive."
"If one compares the main points from the opinion I drafted for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the final version that Mr Doorn, the rapporteur, presented us with after the troika negotiations, one sees that they overlap to a great degree, for example as regards rotation, the costs incurred by small and medium-sized businesses, and liability."
"I welcome the proposal that the Commission should produce a study on the liability issue by the end of 2006, and I agree with what Mr Schwab had to say about this."
"I would have liked to hear a more positive message in relation to two other important matters, those being the establishment of an audit committee and the provision of additional non-audit services."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs gave an enthusiastic welcome to the requirement that audit committees be set up and endorsed the Commission’s thinking."
"Taken as a whole, Mr Doorn’s report is a step in the right direction, and I am grateful to him for the work he has done as rapporteur."
"The vote we are about to hold is crucial to the successful completion of the fast-track procedure, and so the markets will soon get the signal they have been eagerly awaiting."
"I am also glad that Mr Doorn, in his report, addresses the issue of comitology, although I would expect the date for the sunset clause to be 1 January rather than 1 April 2008."
"It strikes me, though, that it will be difficult to accept the proposed approach to implementing International Standards on Auditing, known as IAS or ISA."
"Here, too, Parliament must hold fast to its right of callback."
"Although Mrs Wallis, my group’s shadow rapporteur on the lead Committee, recommends that we approve this report, I myself will be abstaining from voting by reason of the reservations I have already adduced."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of my speech is above all to emphasise, without rhetoric or clichés, the important work that Mr Doorn has done; moreover, as I said in committee and will repeat here, the work he has done is, in my opinion, intelligent, balanced and far-sighted."
"I believe that the directive is really important, because the problem of market security exists, as the scandals that have come to light have highlighted even more."
"For some time there has been a need for a directive like the one that we are putting forward, which is proving to be a success at first reading and establishes the balance that we have reached in Parliament."
"There are new guarantees for savers, on whom, as with consumers, we must focus our main attention, since the financial relationship between banks, issues and savers remains a fundamental factor in maintaining a country’s social stability."
"I also thank the rapporteur for the intelligent solution put forward for the rotation of auditing firms."
"My country is very much in favour of that solution and very pleased with it – I speak from my own experience, of course, but I believe other countries will have come to the same conclusion."
"That is another point on which we must acknowledge the balance achieved by Mr Doorn and his colleagues."
"The agreement on enforcement measures gives a measure of just how important Parliament can and must be in finding that tricky operational balance that the directive requires."
"To conclude, I agree with all the positive assessments that have been made;"
"I am very pleased to state in formal terms that the report has been worthwhile, and the rapporteur and I put it to this House."
"Mr President, when we first discussed the issue of corporate governance following the high-level group's report, it was in the context of Enron and the WorldCom scandals."
"Experts from the EU accounting industry said that 'it could never happen in Europe', but then we had Parmalat, which had an audit committee – as did Enron – made up of eminent independent professors."
"The problem was that they did not show any independence of mind in challenging culpable business partners and the executive board."
"Prescriptive audit committees were never the answer under this proposal, which is more about changing audit culture and practice."
"Thanks to the pragmatism of our rapporteur, Bert Doorn, and good cooperation with the Commission and Presidency, we now have a flexible EU instrument that will raise the quality and consistency of audits across Europe while also respecting the good domestic company law provisions already in place."
"A principles-based threats and safeguards approach will lead to a much more effective and robust EU regime."
"This will prove much better than the Sarbanes-Oxley rules-based system which may make it easier to lock someone up but does not improve the ethics, independence and public supervision of auditing structures."
"It was sensible to remove the prescriptive obligation for mandatory audit committees and replace it with a proposal to assign those functions to a body that meets audit standards and objectives and can implement the requirements in a transparent way."
"I also welcome compromises around the issue of audit partner rotation and the issue of non-audit work."
"However, we have to deal with the issue of comitology."
"The Commission and successive Presidencies, including the United Kingdom Presidency, have stepped up their efforts to achieve better regulation by improving the quality of EU laws and transposition and implementation."
"Parliament has to be involved in this better regulation agenda and must have the right as co-legislator to ensure that the expert laws voted through this House can be scrutinised and monitored."
"It also has a role in transposition and implementation."
"I welcome the initiative by the Presidency and the offers to take forward the reform of the 1999 comitology procedures to ensure we can play a role in the better regulation and regulatory process, and I look forward to amendments to be put forward by Parliament being accepted in this area so that we can genuinely can play our role in the cooperation process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of this matter’s relevance to the competitiveness of European industry, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has devoted a great deal of attention to it."
"It is important particularly to those companies quoted on stock exchanges that ownership rights should be given the highest priority when the auditors are appointed."
"It is here, in particular, that national sensitivities come into play."
"There is also, of course, the question of costs to be considered."
"These can be enormous, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses that seek a stock exchange quotation, take the necessary steps and endeavour to be as transparent as they are required to be, and so I urge that limited liability be discussed with the insurers, so that the auditors can act with the necessary responsibility."
"Mr President, a series of recent scandals has dented the confidence of consumers and investors."
"I could mention events concerning Enron or Parmalat, for example."
"The magnitude of these scandals was alarming, and they involved various kinds of fraud."
"The European Commission’s initiative constitutes a welcome response to the situation."
"The Commission’s draft on statutory audits is the result of many years of preparation and incorporates recommendations made in 2000 and 2002."
"This directive is to replace the 1984 eighth directive concerning statutory auditors, which only contains the principles of accreditation of auditors, but does not refer to the audit procedure, supervision or external quality control."
"The new draft directive defines the duties of statutory auditors clearly and lays down certain ethical principles. The aim is to ensure the professionalism and independence of statutory auditors, which implies their honesty, professional competence, trustworthiness, professional secrecy and overall responsibility."
"The Commission’s proposal on the principle of rotation of firms and partners is yet another contentious issue to be added to the list of those that have given rise to strong opinions."
"In general, the principle of rotation deserves support, as it ensures independence and encourages an objective assessment."
"The negative aspects of rotation are additional costs, loss of know–how, and the consequent risk of errors."
"Audit firms should be changed at least every seven years, and the break between contracts should last at least two years."
"Every effort should be made to ensure healthy competition, reduce the risk of fraud and provide high quality services."
"The procedures presented in the report seem to represent a balanced and sensible response to the need to guarantee both the quality of audits and the independence of auditors."
"In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that we should be aiming to restore confidence to the market, and also to strengthen shareholders’ rights, so as to make investments safer and European businesses more competitive."
". Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their contributions and for their great work in getting this very important Directive dealt with."
"At the outset I probably should have declared that in my past life I was an auditor and I still pay an annual subscription to the Irish Institute of Chartered Accountants, even though, as I have said to many people, I would not like to be too reliant on any set of accounts I would now prepare for anybody."
"I suppose I should have said that at the outset."
"Mr Doorn and others raised the question of audit reliability and personally I take a great interest in this particular area."
"I have urged my services to treat this issue with great urgency."
"The study will be commissioned shortly so that we should be ready to put forward our findings before the end of 2006."
"That is our intention and hopefully it will be possible to adhere to that timetable with some ease."
"The question was also raised about audit committees."
"Audit committees are often necessary to help auditors keep their backs straight against possible pressure from management."
"The European Parliament and the Council support the view that as much leeway as possible should be left to the Member States of the EU to invent their own system for audit committees of listed companies as long as they perform all the functions listed in our Directive."
"We have been flexible here to accommodate these concerns as far as possible."
"Perhaps, as Mrs McCarthy said, you can have to best rules-based system in the world, or at least think you have the best rules-based system in the world, but it will never prevent a scandal or fraud if more than two people collude in trying to ensure that some fraudulent activity takes place; no matter whether or not we have a rules-based system – and remember, they had a rules-based system in the United States for some time and it did not prevent any of the scandals on that side of the Atlantic, and nor of course will an absolutely principles-based system either."
"No auditing procedures in the world and no internal control mechanisms put in place will be able to 100% guarantee that fraud or financial wrongdoing will never take place."
"However, it should, after the shortest possible period of time, allow people to find out exactly what is going on."
"It is very important for business and for everybody that people have confidence in the auditing profession, confidence in the independence of auditors, in the type of standards that they adhere to and in the ethics of the profession."
"I am afraid that I would have to accept, as an erstwhile member of that profession, that the scandals of recent years have undermined the public's confidence in the auditing and accounting profession."
"I think that goes without saying and it is the job of the profession to make sure that confidence is restored and that the various changes that have been made, both within the profession and now by the European institutions, as well as what hopefully the Members States will do, will give people greater cause to believe that the standards of the auditing profession are as high as we can make them."
"Again as I have said, the question of comitology was raised as it was in the previous debate, and I repeat that the proposal to suspend it after two years, except for Article 26, is acceptable to the Commission in this particular Directive."
"I thank the Members for their detailed contributions."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the protocol setting out the tuna fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Islamic Federal Republic of the Comoros on fishing off the Comoros for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010 [COM(2005)0187 C6-0154/2005 2005/0092(CNS)] (A6-0260/2005)."
". Mr President, before outlining the Commission's position on this dossier, let me first thank the Committee on Fisheries and especially the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, for her excellent work carried out within the very tight deadlines."
"I am happy to be able to present to you the draft proposal for the conclusion of the Protocol setting out the tuna fishing opportunities and financial contribution under the EEC-Comoros Agreement."
"As the honourable Members know, the Community has a longstanding relation with the Comoros in the fisheries area."
"The first fisheries agreement with the country dates back to 1988."
"Although it is the smallest tuna agreement, it is of importance due to the strategic location of this fishery in the Indian Ocean as well as for the fishing possibilities obtained."
"The new Protocol, which was initialled on 24 November 2004, covers a 6-year period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010."
"The protocol grants fishing opportunities for 40 tuna seiners and 17 surface longliners and has a financial contribution of EUR 390 000 per year."
"The agreement is one that is of mutual benefit to both parties and contains a number of new elements including the following."
"Firstly, an exclusivity clause, which prohibits the existence of private licences or other private arrangements outside the scope of the Agreement."
"Secondly, a VMS requirement to reinforce checks on vessels operating in Comorian waters."
"Thirdly, the social clause applicable to local seamen signed on by Community vessels."
"Fourthly, rules on taking on board observers and, fifthly, adjustment of the share-out of the cost of the Agreement between the Community and shipowners from a ratio of EUR 75/25 per tonne to EUR 65/35 per tonne, which is already applied in other tuna agreements in the Pacific."
"This increase of the shipowners' share of the cost will gradually be applied to all tuna agreements in the Community as was called for in the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I believe that these new elements introduced in dialogue with the Comoros authorities and according to the principles set out in the new Fisheries Partnership Agreements will ensure that the Comoros Agreement contributes to responsible and sustainable fisheries in the Comoros."
"This work includes the establishment of annual and multi-annual objectives, the distribution of the part of the financial compensation – 60%, the aims to be attained and criteria and procedures in order to allow for an evaluation of the yearly results obtained in accordance with Article 7 of the Protocol."
"Let me now turn to the amendments."
"On Amendment 1, the Commission is of the opinion that this is not necessary, given that the procedure for the adoption of the new Framework Agreement – the Fisheries Partnership Agreement – will soon be launched."
"On Amendments 2, 3 and 5, the Commission is entirely in agreement with their spirit."
"However, the Commission already complies with the transmission of this kind of information in line with both the current inter-institutional arrangements and in particular with the Framework Agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Therefore, the Commission considers that these amendments are not necessary."
"On Amendment 4, may I recall the basic Community provisions concerning the mandate of the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Community."
"The Council has authorised the Commission to negotiate fisheries agreements and arrangements between the Community and the Comoros."
"Against this background, the periodic renewal does not require a new mandate each time."
"Amendment 6 cannot be accepted by the Commission."
"The Commission has established a constant dialogue with the industry within the framework of a special sectoral group."
"This group meets on a regular basis and discusses upcoming negotiations and any other technical issues."
"In addition, experts from Member States are invited to be present during the negotiations of a fisheries agreement or protocol."
"Mr President, I am sure that this House, like the Committee on Fisheries, will support the signing of this Fisheries Agreement between the European Union and the Comoros, which follows on from previous protocols and which will enable 57 Community vessels to fish until 2010."
"This agreement also represents a further step in the new model of association agreements intended to promote even greater cooperation and greater involvement in the development of the third country’s fisheries sector."
"Nevertheless, while we support the principles behind this model, we must insist that it is far from clear."
"Firstly, it is the first one to reach Parliament in which, unilaterally and without any request from the third country, the Commission has decided to raise the sum paid by shipowners per tonne fished from EUR 25 to 35, that is to say by 40%, and without having consulted them."
"The Commission defends itself by saying that the rise was anticipated in the conclusions of the 2004 Council of Ministers, but what we all deduced from those conclusions was that there would be a gradual increase in these payments, when in reality there has been a rather brutal rise by decree."
"This Parliament, like the sector, finds itself faced with a policy, carried out by the Commission’s negotiators quite independently, and without giving us the opportunity to examine those decisions more than fleetingly, and the protocol reaches our committee – increasingly late by the way – signed and sealed."
"Our Institution does not believe that this situation of obscurantism should continue."
"I therefore propose in my report that shipowners now be allowed to attend joint committees so that they can at least be informed in real time of what is being prepared for them."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, I would like to take this opportunity to ask once again – and this time I am addressing the Council, which is not present – for a member of the Committee on Fisheries to be present in the negotiations as an observer."
"We genuinely do not understand why it objects, since an observer cannot interfere in the decision-making, but if we were to be present, we would be better informed, which cannot do any harm, unless the negotiators have something to hide."
"Equally serious, from a budgetary point of view this time, is the fact that, contrary to the Council’s conclusions, some of these agreements, such as the one we are dealing with today, are not respecting the obligatory differentiation between what is paid in return for fishing opportunities and what is paid as development aid."
"From the point of view of budgetary transparency, this situation is unacceptable."
"Furthermore, the Commission is clearly aware of it and has admitted to the Committee on Fisheries that it is failing to comply with this obligation."
"However, it is not giving the slightest indication of what has led it to do so, at least in this case."
"Finally, Mr President, for the sake of the necessary simplification and following an admirable period of patience on the part of this Parliament, the time has come to demand that the Commission present its model for regional agreements and, in particular, the tuna type of agreement."
"As we know, the tuna fleet is requesting fishing licences from each country of the area so that it can follow schools of tuna that cross the different fishing grounds."
"This currently obliges it to take on a significant number of seamen from each of the countries, which turns each vessel into a miniature United Nations, sometimes causing insurmountable problems with languages, customs, traditions and also space, not to mention cost."
"This is a totally absurd situation, as is the uncertainty over some of the more practical aspects, such as the actual definition of a tide or, for example, the mechanics of electronic transmissions."
"It may be understandable that negotiators do not take account of these details, but if we put ourselves in the shoes of a skipper for a moment, we will realise that, at the end of the day, his main concerns are administrative and personnel issues rather than the fishing itself."
"Mr President, while calling, naturally, for the approval of this agreement, which is essential to the European supply of tuna and to the fisheries sector of the Comoros, I would like account to be taken of the comments I have made here."
". Mr President, Commissioner Borg, I would just like to start by re-emphasising that fisheries policy, which is of course so important in the European Union, is a classic example of the need to reconcile economic interests and the needs of the environment."
"The European Union has set itself the goal of protecting fish stocks and helping them to recover, while at the same time avoiding overfishing and promoting the economic interests of the fish industry."
"If that is to be achieved, though, transparency is of the very essence, and it is with that in mind that the Committee on Budgets has tabled the two amendments to which I want to devote this speech."
"This agreement is due to expire in 2010, and the crucial issue in relation to it is whether, as it is a new one, there really will be an ex-post evaluation and whether that evaluation will then be forwarded to this House in good time before new arrangements are made and a new Agreement negotiated."
"This House is insistent that it be properly and punctually notified when the data of this ex-post evaluation are available, and so what I would like from you, Commissioner Borg, is a quite unambiguous undertaking that this House will indeed be so informed and will receive the data from any such ex-post evaluation within the proper deadlines."
"By the same token, we are fed up with the situation in which proposals for agreements reach this House months after fishing has already commenced."
"I also expect from you a clear statement as to whether you will change this practice and start notifying and informing this House in good time."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank both rapporteurs, whose report I have read with much interest."
"Tuna is a much-loved, healthy fish, packed with the Omega 3 fish oil that is so important."
"What is important is for the tuna species to survive fisheries so that future fishermen will be able to catch tuna and future consumers will be able to enjoy it."
"The content of the fisheries agreements is of vital importance to European fisheries, the developing countries and particularly also to the fish."
"Although, as a new member on the Committee on Fisheries, I missed the debates on the Comoros, I would nevertheless like to make two points."
"The first one pertains to fair fish and real partnerships."
"The agreement follows an arrangement that was very profitable for the European Union."
"For every euro that was invested, the European Union earned EUR 5.7 back."
"Unfortunately, the same could not be said about the Comoros, a poverty-stricken country."
"I am therefore a little surprised at Mrs Fraga’s disapproval of the fishermen’s and the EU’s contributions increasing."
"It was a very profitable arrangement, after all."
"Only by striking real partnerships, rather than by unilateral financial benefit, can development cooperation, fisheries and scientific research become more cohesive."
"I am right behind the Committee on Development when it says that it would like to spend fishery funds on local fishermen."
"I would like to see more detailed specifications about local people being employed on the boats."
"Secondly, with regard to sustainable fish, consumers must be given the opportunity of buying sustainable fish, sustainable tuna, certified by MSE or a similar body."
"Sustainable fish is, above all else, fish that is not being over-fished."
"For that purpose, we require certain data, and close monitoring and inspection must also be in place."
"Article 7 of the Protocol stipulates that the EU should help ensure the future sustainability of tuna fishing."
"I have a few questions."
"Can the Commissioner assure me that ‘in future’ means as soon as possible?"
"What action will you be taking in order to ensure in the short term that Indo-Pacific tuna is also sustainable tuna?"
"What capacities must the Government of the Comoros develop in order to be able to guarantee sustainable tuna fishing, and what support is the European Union offering in this respect?"
"Sustainable fish is also fish without the bycatch of threatened fish species."
"Sharks, turtles and dolphins run the risk of being circled and caught."
"Bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna are threatened species that are caught in the same nets."
"Are you aware, Commissioner, of the quantities of bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna that are to be found in the Comoros region?"
"When will the results of the studies which the European Union has commissioned be published and what level of support is the European Union giving to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission’s Working Party on Bycatch?"
"Mr President, the Comoros is a long way from here, and what we are doing there is happening secretly. It does not reach the debate here at home."
"If, however, the TV pictures from Comoros were to reach our living rooms, Parliament would never approve this agreement."
"We buy up the fishing rights from the government, but those from whom we are really taking the fish, that is to say the fishermen in the villages, have no influence and seldom receive adequate compensation."
"Neither national parliaments nor the European Parliament has any influence worth mentioning, but is presented with a ."
"Only ten months after the agreement has begun are we given a chance to express our opinion."
"This Parliament has demanded change on many occasions."
"It is time to take back democratic control over these agreements, which have more to do with old-fashioned colonialism than with modern trade and democracy."
"I therefore welcome the proposal that more information be obtained."
"I would thank the Commission for the increased co-funding from those who make use of the agreement, so that there is less of a burden on our taxpayers, but I regret the fact that the agreement is being extended to include several tonnes per year."
"I believe that the partner country’s small-scale fishing communities must be given the right of veto over the agreements."
"My group will vote against this agreement, which favours EU fishermen at the expense of poorer colleagues in the South."
"Mr President, the EU’s fisheries agreements with third countries have been exposed to extensive criticism by more than one organisation working on development issues, including Sweden’s Committee for International Development Cooperation (Sida)."
"The agreements have certainly been reformed, but criticism of the present partnership agreements is fully justified."
"The Comoros has a strategic position and, according to the rapporteur, a fisheries agreement with this island republic would therefore supplement the EU’s present agreements with third countries."
"It is, in other words, the EU’s narrow interests that are to be protected, rather than what might be thought of as the interests of the indigent Comoran fishermen."
"The EU exploits its assumption of power in order to secure short-term economic interests."
"The tuna fish agreement with the Comoros is not especially extensive, but the issue of fisheries agreements is important on principle."
"It would be only right for the costs of the fisheries agreements to be imposed in full on those parties who choose to make use of them."
"Why should European taxpayers pay for fisheries agreements that favour the fleets of just a few EU countries?"
"The rapporteur believes that shipowners pay too much for these agreements."
"The June List believes that this should not be an issue for the EU and that the agreements should not be paid for at all using EU resources."
"The UK Presidency and the Commission have stated that development issues in Africa are a policy area to be given priority."
"There is, however, limited will seriously to reform the EU’s counterproductive agricultural, trade and fisheries policy."
"The ambition seems to be to increase aid without doing anything about the structural problems that make it difficult for the developing countries to escape from poverty."
"Mr President, previous speakers have not even bothered to visit the countries with which we sign fisheries agreements;"
"I have done so: I have been in the Comoros, I have lived amongst its people, I have seen how they live and I have seen the importance of this Agreement to the economic development of these islands."
"I therefore believe that we should not be talking nonsense before knowing what we are talking about."
"I entirely agree with the rapporteur on this issue."
"I believe that this is an important Agreement for us and for the population of the Comoros and I therefore approve of its wording."
"The Agreement helps to maintain the stability of the sector here and contributes to the development of those countries."
"We have moved on from the first exclusively commercial agreements to agreements by means of which we are helping those countries to develop."
"The current structure of the agreements assists the development of these countries."
"We could probably do more if the fishermen and the shipowners were to participate more."
"The Committee on Fisheries’ proposals in this regard are reasonable and we fully support them; they would help us to avoid bureaucratic procedures."
"We also need a general policy with regard to the whole of this area of the Indian Ocean, in which, although our presence in terms of seiners is significant, the general presence of the European Union is very small compared to the fishing of these resources by Asian countries such as Taiwan, Japan or the Republic of Korea, who are exploiting those resources at the expense of the population."
"The European Union’s volume of fishing is very moderate and I naturally agree with the rapporteur’s complaint that there is a kind of discrimination, by virtue of which, in the agreements with the south, it is the fishermen who have to pay, while in the case of the agreements with the north, this increase in payments that they now want to impose on us is not happening."
"In any event, the Agreement is important for us and for the countries of this area and I would naturally like this approach to be taken with regard to other aspects."
"There could perhaps be reasons for opposing it in view of the considerations I have expressed, but I believe that the European Union is obliged to continue developing this type of relationship."
"These countries, and the Comoros in particular, desperately require our presence."
"The Comoros are three small remote islands in the Indian Ocean, they are not really in any great strategic position, they are in the Mozambique Channel, their citizens suffer from every possible disease – dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever and others – and the great problem facing these islands is precisely the absence of the elements required for development."
"I believe that the Fisheries Agreement is something that can and must help, provided that we involve our seamen and fishermen much more in the economic development of these islands, for their own benefit and also for the benefit of the European Union."
". Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the speakers for their remarks."
"I would like to comment on a number of points, beginning with the one raised by Mrs Fraga concerning licence fees."
"The rebalancing of costs is not something which is new."
"If one looks at the evolution of this since the mid-1980s, one finds that until the mid-1990s the share ratio was 80:20."
"Then, from the mid 1990s up to the present day, the share ratio changed to 75:25."
"We are introducing a new sharing of costs of 65:35."
"I can say that the Commission's decision to increase the tuna fee paid by shipowners is justified in several respects, including the need to increase the financial responsibility of EC shipowners and guarantee a fair contribution for the coastal state."
"As indicated in the Council's conclusions of July 2004, this contribution must be fair, balanced and non-discriminatory."
"The 35:65 share is already applied in all the tuna agreements concluded in the Pacific, including Kiribati and the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Member States concerned did not object to this."
"By the time of the renewal of the EC-Seychelles Protocol last September the Commission had already announced to the Council's external group that it intended to adopt the 35:65 ratio."
"During negotiations, the Seychelles asked the Commission to delay this change in order to avoid distortion of competition with the Tanzania Agreement, which is soon to enter into force and under the initial phase of which the applicable ratio will still be 25:75."
"The EC/Seychelles agreement therefore maintained the 25:75 ratio, but a formula was agreed under which the transition to the 35:65 ratio will take effect in the near future."
"Harmonisation of the 35:65 ratio in other fisheries agreements will be introduced in 2006."
"The same 35:65 ratio will be introduced in the other fisheries agreements in the area, those with Mauritius and Madagascar, which will be negotiated in 2006."
"In addition, the Commission intends to hold a meeting with the tuna sector by the end of 2005, to discuss all relevant issues."
"I also underline and repeat that there is constant dialogue with the sector, within the framework of the special sectoral group, and I will see to it that this dialogue is further intensified."
"I will also see what can be done to minimise as far as possible the delays in making payments to third parties."
"On the point raised by Mrs Corbey, may I point out that all agreements are undertaken further to an assessment of the health of fish stocks."
"Let me cite the recent Morocco agreement, where the Commission showed how seriously it takes its obligations by first undertaking a scientific assessment, in accordance with the new policy for the fisheries partnership agreements."
"The agreement was then targeted on what one may term 'the excess stock'."
"In other words, the fish that can be caught sustainably, beyond what local fishermen can themselves catch."
"So the agreement only covers that excess stock of fish within the limits of sustainability."
"This policy is being adopted and applied to all fishery partnership agreements."
"I thank Mr Schlyter for his support with regard to the rebalancing of the costs."
"I also thank Mr Medina Ortega for his support with regard to the new partnership agreement on fisheries and I will see to it that everything is done to limit unnecessary red tape."
"I would also like to thank him for the insights stemming from his direct experience of fisheries in the Comoros and the Indian Ocean."
"In reply to Mrs Goudin, this agreement envisages a development segment under which the Union not only benefits from fishing rights but is obliged to assist in the fisheries sector of the Comoros."
"This is a new element of the partnership agreements which is being introduced to all agreements with third countries."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr Kreissl-Dörfler on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (14203/2004 – C6-0200/2004 – 2000/0238(CNS)) (A6-0222/2005)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you all know the position: the directive on asylum procedures has been the subject of negotiations in the Council for over four years; the outcome therefore reflects a fragile compromise among the Member States of the Union."
"I have to be frank and say that it is a compromise that certainly does not rise to great heights of ambition."
"I am well aware of the concerns expressed in the report, and in part I share them. I therefore thank the rapporteur for the work he has done, even though the difficulties that we have encountered and the fact that the directive still does not aim very high are further good reasons – and I really mean no paradox in this – for Parliament to approve the report today and to make this complex procedure continue until the directive enters into force."
"In my view, there are, first of all, excellent methodological reasons for adopting the report."
"Indeed, if the directive enters into force, any subsequent proposal on this topic will have to go through the system of qualified majority voting, not unanimity any more, and it will have to go through the codecision procedure involving the Council and Parliament."
"That means that, once the first stage is over with the approval of this directive, we shall have the prospect of Parliament having a codecision vote in the subsequent stages, which I consider to be about the substance."
"I am hopeful that we will achieve this result as soon as possible, just as soon as we approve the directive."
"Shifting the procedure from unanimity to qualified majority and from Parliament merely giving its opinion to codecision will allow us to achieve something that for me, perhaps, and I think for many others, is even more important: achieving a common European asylum system by 2010, involving not just the procedures any more, but the substance, the difference in concrete terms between European action and action just by the Member States."
"Then there are other reasons, concerning content, which again justify your voting in favour."
"The directive is certainly just a first step, but you will all recall the Tampere Council several years ago when it was actually decided that Europe’s asylum strategy would be a step-by-step strategy, that is to say the procedure and the substance would not be put into effect at the same time together, but would proceed in stages."
"This is just a first step, I have to admit, but this first step will make a great difference, ladies and gentlemen."
"Today, I think I can say that we have more than 20 different systems for the procedures themselves. I will not say 25, but it is nearly that many."
"A number of concerns remain, as expressed by this Parliament and by the Commission, and also by me personally and in public, about the need to harmonise the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers."
"With the directive, we shall have a common procedure and minimum standards across Europe and, most of all, I would say, we shall give the Court of Justice the power to apply and interpret them. As you well know, the case law of the Court of Justice is often highly advanced in its interpretation."
"We shall also then give the Commission the opportunity to enforce the common rules. These opportunities do not exist today and, in my opinion, they will make a considerable difference."
"If, on the other hand, we were to stop today, if this step-by-step approach were not to go ahead, some of us would certainly continue to call for the text to be improved. I have to be frank, though: the Council is unlikely, highly unlikely, to reopen substantive talks after five years of negotiations."
"As a result, should the Council not intervene, there will be demands and there will probably be growing concerns, but that European strategy on the subject – procedures today and substance and legislation on asylum tomorrow – will not get under way."
"That is why, if we balance the advantages of a text that is not perfect against the serious dangers of a void in European legislation, which worries us even more, I strongly hope that this Parliament can adopt the report and issue a favourable opinion."
". Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, what we are to vote on today is nothing less than one of the building blocks of the European Union."
"The European Union arose from the ruins of the Second World War, and its success is founded upon the lessons that we have learned from the experience of global war, of National Socialism and the dictatorships of the last century, not least in Eastern Europe, all of which obliged many Europeans, in order to save their own lives, to leave their homes and seek refuge in foreign countries."
"Today, people come to Europe seeking refuge from calamity and persecution."
"None of them have left their homelands lightly, for in fleeing they often take their lives in their hands."
"Their dream of a life in safety often ends, though, in reception centres where conditions are sometimes appalling, and then they are sent back to an allegedly safe country, such as Libya, without their individual situations being assessed."
"Are we trying to rid ourselves of every burden and responsibility as soon as possible?"
"I get the impression that we, in Fortress Europe, are less interested in protecting the refugees than in doing the opposite and protecting ourselves from them."
"How, though, are we to discharge our historic responsibility if we do not give refugees an adequate opportunity to explain their reasons for coming here?"
"How are we to be credible in defending European values if we deny those seeking protection access to legal processes?"
"That there is the fear of asylum being abused is not a matter of doubt, but we must not allow that to induce us to betray our values."
"What is needed are common European minimum standards for the treatment of refugees, founded upon the rule of law and upon international conventions and obligations under international law such as the Geneva Convention on Refugees."
"The Council presented us with its proposal for this directive, for consultation purposes, only in November 2004, having already taken its decision."
"One might call this ‘uncooperative cooperation’, and it is something that we reject outright."
"What the Council has now presented us with is also a long way removed from the objectives formulated at Tampere in 1999, and one consequence of that is that the majority of us in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the advisory committees have come to the conclusion that the directive falls short of all expectations in that it makes no significant progress towards harmonisation, in that there are too many instances in which the Member States are allowed to retain their own legal arrangements."
"There are in particular a number of points that give great concern as regards respect for internationally-recognised human rights and the principles of the law as it applies to refugees, and so we have proposed a number of vitally important amendments."
"For a start, we reject the concept, set out in Article 35a, of what are termed ‘super-safe third countries’, that is in itself an outstanding achievement in terms of global philosophy, favouring instead a modification of the concept of ‘safe third countries’ in Article 27, which, it is important to note, we want to be applicable only if the third state has ratified, and complies with, the Geneva Convention and other international human rights treaties, adhering in particular to the principle of non-refoulement provided for in the Geneva Convention on Refugees."
"The person seeking asylum must have the opportunity to set out the reasons why his or her safety cannot be guaranteed in the ‘safe third country’ or in his or her safe country of origin."
"Secondly, we want to reinforce the asylum seeker’s right to an effective legal remedy in accordance with Article 38."
"Thirdly, we call for the rights of children to be reinforced."
"Following on from the statement in the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that every person under the age of 18 is to be regarded as a child, we have all – irrespective of our group allegiances – agreed that all relevant articles of the directive should be modified in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"Fourthly, no asylum seeker should be arrested until such time as it is demonstrated that his or her incarceration is necessary, appropriate, and in line with the standards laid down in the international conventions."
"Asylum seekers should be detained only in institutions that are clearly distinguishable from prisons, and must be guaranteed access to proper legal advice, to properly trained and unbiased interpreters and to qualified medical personnel."
"Under no circumstances must unaccompanied children be interned as immigrants, nor must vulnerable persons such as victims of torture, traumatised persons, or persons with mental or physical handicaps, for whom the authorities should endeavour to find alternatives to internment."
"The report that I have presented, which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, offers the opportunity to create Europe’s first body of asylum law, and a balanced and fair one too."
"Fear of Islamic terrorism and crime must not be used as a misguided excuse for a backwards-looking asylum policy."
"If we abandon the heart of asylum policy, we jeopardise human rights and take an axe to the pillars supporting that community of values that is the European Union."
"Fear is a poor basis for decision-making and hypocrisy is a reprehensible thing in politics."
"Human rights and human lives are at stake here, and neither we nor anyone else must forget that."
"I am very pleased about Commissioner Frattini’s concession."
"I hope that those who decided, perhaps some considerable time ago, that they were going to vote against the report, will now reconsider their position."
"I again urge you to vote to adopt my report, which we also need for next year’s negotiations with the Council."
"I urge you to vote in favour of it for the good of all, and, not least, in remembrance of all those Europeans who were forced into exile by war, ethnic cleansing and persecution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the establishment of a common European right of asylum – as resolved by the Tampere European Council in October 1999 – is very much to be welcomed, although the Council proposal, as amended, is so singularly inadequate that, if the directive were to be implemented unamended in the Member States, protection for refugees in Europe would be reduced to almost nothing."
"One danger arising from the planned introduction of a minimum common list of what are termed ‘safe third countries’ is the major one that the Member States will return asylum-seekers to countries of origin that are regarded as ‘safe third countries’ without either the reasons for these individuals having become refugees being heard or their entitlement to asylum being examined."
"It is for that reason that I, in the opinion I drafted on the report for the Committee on Development, attach particular importance to the European Parliament being fully involved in all future decisions affecting the common list."
"The inclusion or deletion from a minimum common list of states that can be – or cannot be – regarded as safe third countries must not be a matter for the Council or the Commission alone."
"This is demanded in the report on which we are to vote, as are improved protection for children and minors and the rules relating to the Member States’ obligation to inform refugees of their rights and obligations in a language that they understand."
"The report includes a number of very important amendments aimed at ensuring that no Member State can deport asylum seekers or return them to areas where their life or freedom would be at risk by reason of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or their holding particular political views."
"I ask my fellow-Members of this House to give the report their backing."
"If we are to secure the protection of refugees in Europe, this report will make a great difference, as it will also to the position of the people concerned in the Member States."
". – Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Frattini said, this has been a lengthy process."
"The first proposal was tabled five years ago; in 2001, Parliament tabled over one hundred amendments in the Watson report; the Council spent two years in negotiations and finally arrived at the general approach in April 2004."
"I was very disappointed that the European Parliament was only consulted after the Council had reached a political agreement, which means that, in practice, the Council will now pay no attention to this debate; the Council’s absence from the Chamber sums up perfectly its attitude to this debate."
"The fact is, as Mr Frattini said, the directive is an important one."
"This first step towards setting a European asylum system in motion is one we must take as a matter of urgency, and this proposal for a directive is the first legally binding instrument dealing with the asylum process."
"We must set up common asylum arrangements so that we can manage migratory flows in the most effective and fairest way possible, both for immigrants and for the host societies."
"This must, moreover, be done without breaching the 1951 Geneva Convention, with particular regard to the principle of , whereby no State will return such people to countries or territories in which their lives or freedoms will be endangered."
"That being said, we must take on board the fact that the Member States wish to combat the abuse of asylum systems by economic migrants."
"I should like to commend the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, on his work."
"I supported many of his amendments, and similarly most of my proposals were incorporated, with regard to humanitarian issues and the protection of asylum seekers’ rights, the need for rapid and effective procedures, detention conditions and the protection of minors and others who may be vulnerable."
"We disagree, however, on two key points, namely the disappearance of the lists of safe countries, which already existed in some Member States, and the scrapping of the concept of the ‘super-safe’ country."
"We therefore ask for separate voting on several amendments."
"The concept of ‘super-safe’ country certainly applies to European third countries, such as Switzerland, which uphold very high standards of human rights and refugee protection."
"This concept was a success when it was implemented in Germany; there was a reduction in the number of cases of abuse and in the number of people seeking asylum."
"Some people believed that this solution contravened the Geneva Convention and that it breached the principle of This is why we consulted Parliament’s legal service, which has just issued an opinion stating that we were right, and that the safe countries solution is fully compatible with the international obligations to which we are bound."
"We also reintroduced an amendment that was not adopted in committee, which proposes that an effective system should be in place whereby the asylum seeker will always have the right to appeal a decision and to await the subsequent decision in the country in which he applied for asylum."
"If these amendments are adopted, I feel that we will have a report that matches our responsibilities, and the Council would do well to follow our lead."
"If we keep the amendments contained in the initial version, I fear that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will not be able to lend its backing to the report."
". Mr President, I am, of course, keen, first of all, to thank our rapporteur for his work."
"We must support him so that the European Parliament might express a forceful opinion on this crucial issue."
"The report, which is extremely well-balanced, is a good text upon which to base the drafting of an asylum and immigration policy."
"The European Parliament must maintain a strong position in the drafting of this policy."
"On the eve of the transition to the codecision stage in the area of asylum policy, I call on the Council to restore good faith among the European institutions by demonstrating that it is ready to listen to the European Parliament."
"As it stands, the Council’s text does not, in fact, really allow harmonisation of the asylum policies to take place at European level."
"On the contrary, it grants the Member States too many possible derogations and exceptions."
"Furthermore, these derogations prevent us from attaining a good common denominator; it is, rather, the case that the lowest common denominator is given precedence: the levelling down of the asylum policy in Europe."
"Above all, we wish to point out that Europe is truly a land of asylum and that we must protect this humanitarian tradition."
"Europe’s asylum policy must first guarantee a high level of protection to people seeking asylum, by enhancing their fundamental rights."
"Are we only aware of just how lucky we all are to have been born in Europe?"
"Well, the principle of so-called ‘super safe’ third countries is unacceptable, since it is a violation of asylum seekers’ rights."
"Everyone has the right to make an individual request and to have his or her request individually assessed."
"A person can very easily be persecuted in a country that, on the surface of it, is safe."
"History has provided us with sufficient evidence of that, if only in the 20th century."
"The safe country principle can be very dangerous if it is not strictly controlled and, consequently, it would be unacceptable to end up with 25 different lists."
"Parliament must also carry out a leading role in the drafting of this list, and we owe it to ourselves to ensure that this right is observed."
"What do we want?"
"We are calling for people’s dignity to be respected."
"Let us remember that Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to the right to dignity."
"Go and visit the refugee detention centres in various Member States and you will be enlightened."
"Go and visit them and you will be appalled that people could treat refugees in such a fashion."
"You will be filled with shame, as I was."
"We must rectify the flaws in the asylum policy."
"We must protect the refugees."
"We must also address our people in order to explain to them, and thus to make them understand, the hardship that literally forces these refugees to make their way to Europe."
". Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job."
"For once, I am in total agreement with him: fear is a bad adviser."
"Our guiding principle must be that the European Union, as an area without internal borders, must find a common and effective way of managing its external borders."
"The development of a common asylum and immigration policy forms an integral part of this."
"Despite the fact, though, that Member States have expressed this ambition themselves, it is with only the greatest of difficulty that this policy is getting off the ground."
"Under pressure from public opinion, for which, in fact, national governments and parliaments are often to blame themselves, most Member States are currently adopting their own asylum and migration policy that is as closed off as possible, even though a change to the asylum and migration policy in one Member State has a direct impact on the migration waves and policy developments in the others."
"As the also rapporteur indicated, the drawback of a working method such as this is that the political refugee entitled to asylum appears to be at risk of being pushed aside."
"In the public debate, asylum seekers and illegal immigrants are increasingly lumped together, and, if we are not careful, the terrorists against whom we must fight will be joining them there in the foreseeable future."
"This trend has to be broken as quickly as possible, and that is why a European approach is necessary."
"This afternoon, this House will be voting on the proposal for a directive concerning minimum standards in the Member States for granting or withdrawing refugee status."
"The proposal is of little interest; it is in fact no more than a collection of policies that apply in the 25 Member States."
"It is disappointing that there is hardly any sign of harmonisation."
"It has already been noted that the European Parliament has only advisory powers with regard to the proposal."
"Advice may be very useful, but it can, above all, also be ignored, and that is exactly what the Council will do."
"However, as soon as the final vote has been taken on this report and the directive thereby enters into effect, the European Parliament will acquire codecision in the areas of asylum and immigration, which means that the Council will no longer take decisions by unanimous, but by majority, vote."
"This amendment to the decision-making procedure is vital, as is the need to adopt common asylum and immigration policy in the short term."
"In order that we may send out a powerful political message to the Council, I would urge the Members belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), particularly Mr Coelho, but also those of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to opt for the most viable compromise and thus refrain from voting against this report."
"My group has demonstrated its willingness to do this."
"There is one area that remains difficult for us, namely the concept of the supersafe countries, but I would be very surprised if a majority were to be found for that this afternoon."
"A powerful political signal from this House is what is needed to demonstrate that we, across the political divide, dare fight for a speedy, balanced European approach to the asylum and immigration issue."
"Our visit to Lampedusa last week confirmed for me the need to do this."
"The directive is merely a first step, displaying little ambition so far, but a first step all the same, the importance of which we should not underestimate."
"I should like to finish off by saying that, quite honestly, the fact that the Council is not represented here at the moment, cannot, in my view, be reconciled with the priorities that it set forth before, which is something that I deeply regret."
"Mr President, I agree with virtually everything the previous speaker said, although the voting intentions of my political group have been misinterpreted, which I will come to in a moment."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, who has had an extremely difficult task in trying to improve the deeply flawed document received from the Council, which some of us see as an affront to human rights and to those seeking sanctuary."
"I find it very depressing that this 'fragile compromise', as it was described, was the best anyone could come up with."
"It simply encapsulates a lot of what Member States are already doing."
"Reference has already been made to the concept of super-safe third countries and indeed safe third countries."
"My political group has a major problem with this. At the moment the British Government, for example, is prepared to send asylum seekers back to Iraq, Congo, Zimbabwe and Afghanistan."
"Some of us are dealing at the moment with the case in which not only is someone being returned to Iran, but his British Christian wife is going with him, with the government paying her fare."
"That is all very generous."
"There are many in this House who do not believe any of those countries to be safe."
"Therefore the minimum that we want, if we are to accept this flawed concept of safe third countries, is a unified list decided under codecision with Parliament, which would be a step towards a common asylum policy."
"We are deeply concerned at the implications for non-refoulement, particularly as we are also witnessing an attack on Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with the issue of not returning people to a situation in which they might face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment."
"We welcome the amendment from the rapporteur and Mrs Roure that keeps open the possibility of testing the human rights dimension of this in the courts."
"The committee's amendments have strengthened the text quite considerably."
"There is much greater emphasis, for example, on the rights of children and procedures for the vulnerable."
"There is much greater clarity as regards the need for adequate legal representation and an individual interview, which assumes even greater importance in the context of the single asylum procedure currently under consideration."
"We also welcome the commitment to adequate interpretation."
"Everyone in this House knows how important skilled interpreters are."
"However, our lives are not dependent on them, whereas quality of interpretation can be absolutely crucial to an asylum seeker's future."
"The issue of detention is an extremely vexed subject, to put it mildly."
"However, arbitrary detention with no possibility of appeal is totally unacceptable."
"We believe, therefore, that the committee has done a good job in tightening the legal requirements surrounding this and making it clear that detention is not imprisonment when you have been accused of no crime."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as others of my fellow Members have done, I too should like to thank my friend and colleague Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for the serious work he has performed and for the difficult attempt to put together a report on which we can all agree."
"Unfortunately, the Council has already made up its mind, and we take note of that, as we do of its absence here today, and it will most probably take no account of any suggestions emanating from Parliament."
"I think that the Kreissl-Dörfler report improves the directive put before us, particularly in that it deletes the part about super-safe countries and increases the margin for appeal against any refusal."
"Some major unresolved issues still remain, however, which we cannot sidestep."
"I am thinking in particular of the role of consular authorities, who should not be allowed to meet asylum seekers under any circumstances."
"There remains the issue that asylum seekers should not be held in detention centres."
"We have just visited Lampedusa and seen how the mixing of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants generates barbaric relations inside detention centres."
"In our opinion, these people should not be held in the same places; indeed, we believe that asylum seekers should never be shut up at all."
"If it is absolutely necessary, steps must be taken to ensure that they are not held in the same places and in any case not for six months."
"In addition, we are concerned about the use made in the report of the safe third country concept, about the criteria for defining a safe third country, and also about how the list of such countries will be drawn up."
"To us this is an extremely important point: by definition, a safe third country obviates case-by-case assessment, in that we delegate our responsibility to another country that is considered safe according to rather flexible criteria."
"Asylum is not a concession: it is Europe’s moral and political duty and a right for men and women who are being persecuted or are fleeing from wars."
"Which are these safe countries?"
"According to the criteria, even Morocco or Belarus, for instance, could be considered safe countries, places that we have chosen to consider privileged partners, and this also results in a process of externalising the Union’s borders."
"I believe that safe third countries and the concept of safe third countries endanger the lives of asylum seekers, and that is something that we must not allow."
"I also believe that Parliament has too little control; codecision will only apply when modifying the list of safe third countries."
"Mr Frattini says that the report has been arranged step by step."
"In my view, this step has not been bold enough: we could have aspired to and demanded much more."
"The harmonisation that we have produced is probably such that it even makes some national legislations worse."
"."
"Mr President, today, we are debating refugee status; in a world in which millions of people are on the run, we are fortunate enough to be able to discuss their status."
"Let it be clear that talking about refugees from our position cannot, and indeed should not, be without any consequences."
"It is our duty to treat refugees kindly and fairly."
"One and a half weeks ago, it became painfully clear once again how little prepared we in the European Union are to provide clarity and transparency in respect of refugee treatment."
"I fear that Lampedusa is no exception."
"An even-handed and fair European asylum policy can only exist if the Member States are open about the way they treat their refugees."
"The amendments that have been tabled to Mr Kreissl-Dörfler’s report show no evidence of any priorities having been set."
"If this Parliament had wanted to express clear requests, we would have been better off sticking to the main points."
"Instead, alongside the Council’s political agreement, this House has produced a very extensive document."
"In a consultation procedure, there is little scope for re-writing a Council proposal."
"I would like to make two important points."
"This proposal makes it possible for an application for asylum to be rejected on the basis of a combination of different exceptions."
"Member States are apparently not prepared to allow their own exceptions to be discussed in order to reach an even-handed directive, and that is unacceptable."
"Moreover, there are insufficient guarantees in the directive to accompany the accelerated procedure."
"There is a lack of both clear criteria and sufficient guarantees that this procedure will not be at the expense of the fairness of the normal procedure."
"One important point is what the Council intends to do with Parliament’s amendments; it is very regrettable that the Council is not present to set that out in detail, which is what I would like it to do."
"Commissioner Frattini doubts whether the Council is prepared to adopt any amendments from Parliament."
"It should be possible, though, to enter into a dialogue with the Council on a limited number of points that we regard as essential."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to compliment the Council on its absence."
"I see that as symptomatic of the extent to which this Parliament is taken into account. Alas, poor us!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, while I agree with the rapporteur in calling for greater cooperation among the institutions and in considering that Parliament should always be consulted before the Council comes to any kind of agreement, I should, however, like to express my disappointment at the contents of the report."
"In the document, the rapporteur laments the lack of significant progress in terms of harmonisation, but he does not take into account the different perceptions that countries can have about the immigration problem."
"When I speak of immigration, I deliberately call it a problem: there is no denying that the so-called fringe countries of the European Union suffer most from veritable assaults by immigrants, who sometimes arrive with good intentions, admittedly, but are none the less illegal."
"In the absence of a Community immigration policy, one that is both intelligent and practical, I consider it fair for the Member States to reserve the right to examine only those applications that are considered serious and possibly to reject them."
"Some Members, however, insist on wanting to consider immigration to be a non-Community problem; they imagine that the individual Member States should bear the exorbitant costs that these waves of migration involve."
"Some amendments that go against the Council proposals have been adopted. The definition of ‘safe third country’ has in effect been eliminated, preventing Member States from rejecting applicants deemed unsuitable even if they come from countries considered to observe freedoms and human rights."
"If this Parliament – perhaps because it is too politically correct – wishes to ignore the fact that immigrants, especially those who come through my own country, Italy, get into Europe and almost always end up committing crimes and jeopardising the safety of our citizens, then perhaps it would be better to have the courage to say that each country should regulate itself as it sees fit, that is to say with 20 different kinds of legislation."
"In that case, however, the Left should not go on about a united Europe: they are the only ones being hypocritical; we on the right are certainly not!"
"– Mr President, there was no Portuguese translation at any time during the speech by the last speaker."
"I therefore understood nothing of what the speaker said."
"I should like to ask the Bureau to ensure that the translation service works in such a way that we can follow every debate in its entirety."
"I am sorry to hear this."
"The relevant services will be informed, to ensure interpretation can be received."
"Mr President, we need to understand that the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, and indeed the additional 1967 Protocol, were originally drawn up to guarantee the reception of European political refugees from the Communist dictatorships in the former Eastern Bloc."
"It therefore goes without saying that these instruments are wholly inappropriate to offer an answer to the current asylum problems, particularly the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are coming to Europe from all over the world in search not only of refuge but also of economic fortune and prosperity."
"It is therefore right and proper that we should look for an answer to this problem in the shape of a common European refugee policy, and I would certainly endorse the drafting of a list of safe countries, even if this was a first step and even if – subsidiarity being properly understood – it was left to the individual Member States to use additional lists."
"This can, however, only be a first step."
"A real solution to the problems can only be arrived at once we have the courage to decide that the reception of asylum seekers should take place on the relevant asylum seekers’ continent, and preferably in the regions, of origin, and no longer, therefore, in Europe."
"This reception must, contrary to what has been repeated here , be done in closed and very strictly controlled centres; only those who, following a strict and proper examination, are recognised as refugees can then be received in third countries, possibly also within the European Union."
"That is the only way to drastically reduce the number of bogus asylum applications and combat human trafficking."
"Moreover, this is also the only way of reconciling our citizens, whom we represent, in our own countries, with the need to receive genuine asylum seekers."
"Since unfortunately, the asylum concept has become more or less synonymous with deception and social fraud, rightly so, for which we can certainly have human understanding, we should not be politically responsible or indeed, be a political accomplice."
"For the time being, though, we lack the political will or courage to adopt such bold and necessary policy, certainly with regard to everything that this entails, such as, for example, the refusal of development aid to countries that refuse to conclude repatriation agreements for bogus asylum seekers."
"The present report is, unfortunately, an illustration of this political unwillingness, given the fact that it weakens already meek and timid Council proposals even further, and it is for those reasons that we will, with regret, be unable to endorse this report."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, as long as we are among the most secure regions of the world, people who suffer persecution in their own countries will come to us, and it goes without saying that we should try to help them."
"It is an humanitarian obligation incumbent on us not only as individual states, but also as a European Union, and the fact that that Union’s internal borders are open makes it important that we at least lay down a minimum standard for asylum procedures, with it made clear not only to asylum-seekers but also to the host countries what prior conditions apply, what form the procedures take, and how long they should take."
"It is also a matter of humanitarian obligation that procedures should be transparent and quick, and that they should treat people with dignity, and this is an obligation that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats takes very seriously, as is evident from the amendments tabled by our shadow rapporteur Mr Coelho – which the Committee accepted – in contrast to the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, which does nothing to help us meet our humanitarian obligations."
"The fact is that what matters is not that we should accept as many people as possible, but that we should offer a safe haven to those who are persecuted in their own country and for whom Europe is their only possible place of refuge."
"At the same time, we must be clear in our own minds about the evident fact that the right of asylum is also misused, and so, in order to make room for people who really are persecuted, we have to deter manifestly unfounded applications."
"Using a list of safe third countries helps to do this."
"Practice in Germany has shown this to be a sensible and workable arrangement, although it must be noted that inclusion in the list of safe third countries is conditional upon acceptance and implementation of both the Geneva Convention on Refugees and the European Convention on Human Rights – a high standard that we have set for ourselves."
"It is this concept of safe third countries and safe countries of origin that the rapporteur rejects, with the consequence that, for example, neither Canada nor Norway nor Switzerland are regarded as safe countries for asylum-seekers."
"I have to tell him that they should be included in any procedure, and, while our Green and Socialist Members reject Bulgaria and Romania as safe states, they nonetheless want them to accede to the EU in a few months’ time."
"That is inherently contradictory."
"Moreover, in the original version of his report, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler went as far as to demand that criminals for whom an arrest warrant had been issued should be granted asylum before they were arrested."
"He also, citing cultural sensitivities, rejected the fingerprinting of asylum-seekers, even though that is often the only way to positively identify those who have arrived without papers, and that would make it virtually impossible to determine whether a person had applied for asylum in more than one Member State."
"To Mr Kreissl-Dörfler I have to say that the adoption of his report in its present form would, in my view, be a disservice to many serious applicants for asylum."
"– Mr President, I wish to express my congratulations to Mr Wolfgang Kreissl-Dörfler on his report."
"Why does the Council insist on there being super safe countries when we ourselves recognise that some of them do not comply with basic principles of law and that this would also result in the repatriation of refugees?"
"Why does the Council insist that each Member State should be allowed to have its own list of safe countries and why does it persist in refusing a common list, with the result that each country includes its friends and ‘customers’, even if other Member States do not trust them?"
"Why does the Council insist on ignoring the Convention on the Rights of the Child and persist in discriminating against 17-year-olds?"
"Is it perhaps because the rate of refugees is increasing or perhaps because we have a deluge on the European borders?"
"No, it is not, because refugee applications have fallen recently."
"Unfortunately, as the rapporteur said, the problem is the fear which exists in certain countries from terrorist attacks and the fear created in other countries by unemployment or the violation of social protection networks."
"Fear seeks scapegoats and the easy scapegoats are the persecuted of this world."
"Of course, Europe is not only a geographical and economic continent; it is also a humanitarian continent."
"We have the same obligation to protect our geographical borders as we do to protect our humanitarian borders."
"We have brought our light to the planet."
"The international conventions we talk about here bear the stamp of European humanitarianism and we cannot, on the basis of fear, insecurity and even sometimes racism, attack and violate our own humanitarian borders."
"So congratulations once again to the rapporteur; I am sure that his report will fare well."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteur for his report and for the unambiguous stance he has adopted."
"What this House is doing today is an expression of its innate responsibility for the defence of human rights, and not just of any old right, but of what is perhaps the most ancient human right known to man, the right of asylum, which can be seen as derived from the laws of hospitality, and which was, to the most ancient of human cultures, sacrosanct."
"If we are to scrutinise these decisions, we need to look into the mirror of history."
"If the defence of human dignity can be threatened by fears and public moods, it is scarcely to our credit and does not say much for our courage and strength."
"The Council consults Parliament, so let it be said in the plainest of language what we are dealing with here: interference with fundamental rights, the police, and the laws of Member States, and none of it with any parliamentary legitimacy."
"No wonder people in this EU of ours are putting up resistance, howling with outrage at the democratic deficit, the gaps in fundamental rights and in the monitoring of what goes on."
"To what kind of pass has Europe come?"
"How it is possible for fundamental rights to be interfered with without Parliament having any say in what is decided?"
"The Council consults us, yet it itself is not present; the Council wants to listen to Parliament, and yet it is not here!"
"Why, though, should it be?"
"The fact is that the Council is consulting us only after it has already concluded an agreement, only after its members have done a deal among themselves."
"Heads of Government are not in the least aware of the fact that it goes against our culture for ministers of the interior, ministers with responsibility for the police, to make laws for themselves, to interfere with fundamental rights, to make the most difficult decisions about the balance between security and human rights without reference to Parliament."
"We are, admittedly, being consulted, but the Council is not here."
"The object of this initiative by the Council is to put Europe beyond the reach of refugees, to make a mockery of the right of asylum and to make it, in essence, null and void."
"That is the state we are in."
"– Mr President, the directive on minimum standards for granting refugee status being debated today also revises and abolishes legislatively any protection which existed for refugees on the basis of the Geneva Convention and the Dublin II Regulation."
"Of course, the Council has already agreed and, from one point of view, the debate being held here is entirely cosmetic."
"The directive follows on from the overall anti-refugee policy of the European Union because, as you know, the percentage of applicants granted refugee status has plummeted in the European Union over recent years."
"In Greece, for example, it is less than 1% of applicants and last year the number of asylum applications plummeted."
"Maintaining the concept of a safe to super safe third country, which means repatriation to it without the application being examined, refusing in practice the right to asylum and imprisoning immigrants pending a decision by the authorities demonstrate the European Union’s indifference."
"A great deal has been said about the humanitarianism of the European Union."
"It is hugely ironic: on the one hand you unleash wars and plunder countries in the developing world and, on the other hand, you pretend that you pity the victims of this policy."
"We consider that the amendments by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with the exception of the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, are gratuitously critical of the directive in that, to all intents and purposes, they accept the basic anti-refugee approach."
"The only democratic proposal is to withdraw the directive."
"Mr President, although it is hard to imagine from the relative comfort and security of a western European country like Ireland, globally persecution is more widespread than ever."
"We have only to think of the political persecution in Burma, the economic persecution in East Timor, the religious persecution in Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea and the persecution of mothers and fathers in China for conceiving an unauthorised child and the added persecution if it is a girl child."
"There is the persecution of disabled people in some communist countries and the persecution based on tribal origin in the Sudan."
"Billions of people live under the threat of persecution."
"When that threat moves closer and they must escape, we must receive them."
"It is a human imperative, but also a deeply ingrained cultural imperative in Europe."
"From the earliest times many of us learned the story of St Joseph taking the child and his mother to Egypt because King Herod planned to kill him."
"This report highlights the need for real effective guidelines and standards for refugees."
"I understand this need well."
"I have lobbied for genuine refugees in my own country, largely unsuccessfully."
"I think particularly of two Ukrainian doctors who narrowly escaped death after exposing a government-licensed trade in human tissue obtained from aborted but living 20-week-old foetal babies."
"Those doctors – a consultant oncologist and a paediatrician – who sacrificed their whole careers for their courageous action, have been in Ireland for over a year in an overcrowded hostel with no certainty that they will not be sent back to persecution and death."
"Our response in Ireland, from what I know of other EU countries, tends to be slow and ungenerous."
"In the face of genuine asylum-seeking, this is not good enough."
"Regardless of third countries, can we even call our own EU countries safe countries?"
"We should not automatically presume."
"Mr President, I am very much in favour of respecting human dignity and international conventions and therefore giving due consideration to every request for asylum."
"I am also in favour of granting asylum to asylum seekers that meet the necessary conditions, and denying it to those who fail to do so."
"Particular care should be taken when children are involved."
"It should also be borne in mind, however, that there are few genuine asylum seekers."
"For instance, I have encountered many asylum seekers in Belgium, but none of them really met the relevant conditions."
"Indeed, genuine political activists tend to be reluctant to leave their country of origin because they feel they have a lot to do there."
"Ninety per cent of the problem of asylum actually involves hidden immigration, the underlying reasons for which are not always economic."
"They tend to be psychological and humanitarian."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest we admit these immigrants, but that we also recognise them for what they are."
"A clear distinction should be drawn between asylum and immigration, to allow us to deal more appropriately with requests for political asylum and to control immigration more effectively."
"Mr President, I would like to make two general remarks and three more detailed observations."
"My first general remark is that I myself was an official participant in the Tampere European Council in October 1999, exactly six years ago."
"There we drew up the 10 Tampere milestones to show how we could make progress in these matters, for example."
"Unfortunately, progress has been very slow."
"My second remark concerns the Constitution, which Franco Frattini was also involved in drafting."
"It is regrettable to hear how those who opposed the Constitution here in Parliament would at the same time like a firmer policy on asylum."
"These go hand in hand, and I personally, at least, hope that the Constitution comes into effect in some form or another as soon as possible."
"Next, I wish to make three detailed observations."
"Firstly, this is the only part of the Common European Asylum System, adopted back in 1999, which has not been decided upon."
"I do not believe it is right to sulk about whether the European Parliament was listened to or not."
"What is most important is that this programme should now be carried out."
"My second observation concerns the list of safe countries."
"It is my opinion that a list of safe countries at EU level is vitally important and a very sensible idea."
"A list of this kind is necessary, and it is fine if, after the directive has come into effect, these decisions are taken by a qualified majority."
"Finally, I wish to express my support for the rapporteur."
"He is worried that a negative decision on asylum might be enforced even if the time for making an appeal is still not over."
"Obviously, this cannot be allowed to happen."
"For that reason, I support the rapporteur on this point."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has done and the Commission for this proposal, which we consider an honest attempt to harmonise the treatment of asylum seekers across the European Union."
"This proposal is benefiting today from the European Parliament’s contribution and efforts, so that we can realign ourselves with the spirit of the Tampere Council, which has been mentioned several times today, and also so as to overthrow the primacy of fear as the only political element, the only criterion for action in our policies on immigration and the right to asylum."
"Now, however, it is important to oversee the implementation of the directive as amended and to ensure that it really does become the new Europe-wide legislation that is implemented in all our countries."
"Above all, with regard to the new definition of a safe third country, we must avoid – if I may say so, Mr President – certain fanciful interpretations that we have heard today from the benches on the right: a safe third country for us means adopting a European list of safe countries, and adopting it under the responsibility of Parliament as a party in the codecision procedure."
"Objective, precise conditions are needed: precisely the opposite of what is happening today."
"Thousands of migrants leave Lampedusa to be expelled and sent to Libya, which is anything but a safe country, Mrs Klamt; and when people are sent from the United Kingdom to Iraq, they are going to a country that is anything but a safe third country."
"It is also a case of changing the function of Parliament. Today we are not offering the Council a polite suggestion; instead, we are calling for clear, strict and responsible rules."
"To conclude, I believe that the basic problem is to make the Council and all the European institutions understand that Europe today cannot simply look after itself, but that it must instead look after the rights of those who are now suffering the violence of war and the humiliation of persecution."
"In view of all that, we must ask ourselves whether the problem is that we receive the asylum applications or rather whether the problem is the war and persecution from which those refugees are fleeing."
"Even before we put it to the European institutions, that is a question that we should put to our own consciences."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by warmly thanking the rapporteur for his report, which I am sure we can support unreservedly."
"Where human rights are concerned, it is important that the European Union should function as a role model for other states outside it, yet resolutions such as these all too readily jeopardise them."
"How, in future, are we to compel other states to comply with international law on asylum if we no longer take it seriously within the European Union?"
"I find it a matter of concern that the President-in-Office of the Council, the British Home Secretary, Mr Clarke, at the meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers in Newcastle on 9 September, argued that the European Convention on Human Rights might need to be reinterpreted."
"He would like to be able to deport preachers of hatred and terrorists – who are, admittedly, frightening presences on the contemporary scene – even if they face torture or the death penalty in their country of origin."
"This I regard as no more and no less than a flagrant disregard of international asylum law."
"It is quite clear to me, and to my group, that the ‘super-safe third countries’ rule is unacceptable."
"Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has already referred to this, and I endorse his criticism of it."
"It is obvious that the Council needs to make improvements here."
"Mr President, the consistent asylum policies adopted by Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland have enabled these countries to deter innumerable people who would never have had any right to asylum from undertaking a dangerous journey and to thereby deal a severe blow to the people-traffickers."
"A policy of speeding up procedures and of rigorous deportations has made it possible for them to reduce the flood of asylum-seekers by up to 50% and to save millions that would have been spent on pointless casework."
"They are nevertheless adhering strictly to the definition of refugees as laid down in international conventions and, by so doing, have even managed to increase the numbers whose claims are being recognised."
"On the one hand, this prevents the exploitation of the social security system; on the other, the effect was to make the proceedings more humane and welcoming for genuine refugees and enabled them to be speedily integrated by means of obligatory courses on the country’s language and customs, essential in making a new start in a new home."
"If we want to wipe out Europe’s people-trafficking industry, which is a cause of suffering and unending misery, if we want to prevent those granted asylum from being drawn into the criminal milieu and to help those refugees who have not come to us for economic reasons alone, applications for asylum without a genuine need for asylum being demonstrated are simply no longer acceptable."
"As for whether this report constitutes a step in the right direction, that is, in my view, a matter of doubt."
"– Mr President, it is right that the European Union takes concrete steps towards a common policy regarding immigration and asylum which includes clear provisions regarding the repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"Until now as we can see in Malta's case, the countries of Southern Europe, have been left to fend for themselves, and consequently they are facing a national crisis."
"However, to develop a common policy, we must not look only at the obligations which each country has to face, but we must also see how the burden can be shared."
"Unfortunately, Europe is still far from the situation where the burden of this problem can be shared equally between everyone and there are countries who are carrying a much heavier load than they can actually carry."
"And let us be realistic, the burden must not be carried only by European countries, but it should be carried also by the countries from which the migrants originate, as well as transit countries, such as Libya."
"What can be done in order that countries of origin, especially those considered ‘safe countries’ would cooperate?"
"What can be done so that a transit country such as Libya, fulfils its obligations also by, amongst other things, entering into a repatriation agreement?"
"These are the questions which we should also be asking."
"Especially, we should address this subject, Mr President, in a holistic way, especially when deciding which countries should be considered 'safe' or 'super-safe'."
"I say ‘Yes’ for a common European policy, but a policy of solidarity where the burden is shared equally, and a policy which is coherent and insistent with third countries, so that they too should burden their responsibility."
"I finish off with a comment about the role of Parliament."
"We must be careful, because if this Parliament imposes on the Member States burdens which are too heavy, then we should not be surprised if the Council ignores us."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Kreissl-Dörfler, for a constructive report."
"It is important for us all to work towards the same goal: that the EU should, in the long run, conduct a policy on refugees and asylum that is the same for everyone everywhere."
"Rules concerning safe or very safe countries give rise to a disturbing and unclear legal picture and lead to refugees being treated differently in different countries."
"My own country, Sweden, does not apply general rules or the concepts of ‘safe countries of origin’ and ‘safe third countries’. Instead, we see all refugees as individuals and consider each of them on an individual basis."
"A Member State can then assess refugees’ individual histories and their need to have their reasons considered."
"A country may be safe for a group, collectively, but be impossible for an individual or family to return to, precisely because the person or people concerned may have been politically active in union work or belong to a non-governmental organisation engaged in activities that incur disapproval."
"I naturally also view with unease the fact that, in both international contexts and the EU, children’s and young people’s age of majority is tampered with."
"No one is grown up at the age of 16, either in these or in other cases."
"I hope that, with the help of this report, we shall make some headway in the process that, in time, should provide us with a common policy on refugees and asylum in the EU."
"That is what people in the EU want us to do because they want to see the EU as a single entity."
"Mr President, I should like to join with previous speakers in congratulating the rapporteur."
"The aim of the directive we are debating is to establish a simple, clear, effective and humanitarian system for dealing with refugees in the European Union according to a common set of minimum standards."
"The system must also respect human rights."
"This directive is certainly needed, because not all Member States of the European Union have in place national systems for dealing with refugees."
"Immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees are a problem for the Union as a whole."
"All the Member States are affected, regardless of the number of refugees they have to deal with."
"A refugee who files an application in Poland is not simply a problem for Poland."
"That refugee should be a concern for countries a long way away from Poland, because he or she is likely to relocate."
"Consequently, issues and policies pertaining to refugees have a European dimension and should be dealt with at European level."
"I believe we have fallen into a trap as we discuss this directive."
"We have allowed ourselves to be swayed by our natural fear of terrorism, which might actually be more of an obsession."
"We cannot allow ourselves to perceive every refugee as a potential terrorist."
"It is important to keep the right balance between our normal justified fears for our own security on the one hand, and traditional European hospitality on the other."
"Another comment I would like to make is that the European Parliament cannot remain on the sidelines as the policy on asylum is developed."
"I was surprised to note today that it has fallen to the European Parliament to call for compliance with international law."
"We would like to point out to the House that the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees is not being complied with, and in addition, the 1967 Additional Protocol has not been implemented."
"These shortcomings could be remedied if the relevant amendments are accepted at the vote."
"The House should support this directive, because it will serve as a kind of safety valve Europe sorely needs."
"Millions of refugees are eagerly awaiting it, and we could help these people by ensuring minimum standards and fair treatment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who have spoken. I have taken good note of their comments."
"There are certainly non-negotiable values in Europe: protecting the life and dignity of every person is an institutional and, above all, a moral duty of ours, and in that respect I thank the rapporteur for having emphasised that and also other speakers for having repeated it clearly."
"I believe that the European Union should acknowledge and uphold this basic right for anyone who is truly fleeing persecution or war, but I mean truly fleeing."
"There is in fact another very clear point, mentioned by Mrs Klamt, amongst others: it is important to avoid abuse; it is important to distinguish clearly between those who are true refugees and are actually fleeing, and those who are economic migrants instead."
"It is a matter of credibility. The European strategy requires precise laws and sure means of enforcing them."
"That is the only way in which we can give a truly shared and sharable response both to those who would have fear prevail and to those who would have the duty of giving a welcome prevail."
"Both extremes can, I believe, find common ground if we give ourselves transparent laws and clear rules for implementing them, with no more grey areas between what is allowed and what is not."
"That is why the directive can and must enter into force as soon as possible."
"In that way, ladies and gentlemen, we shall be able to avoid retaining those legislative differences between Member States that often result in differential treatment for people who are in the same situation."
"That, too, is a serious violation, when someone in one Member State is in the same situation as someone else in another Member State but is treated differently."
"It is a serious injustice, which the directive can in some way reduce and eliminate."
"That is why a Europe-wide measure is needed, and I fully agree with that, even though, as many of you have realistically pointed out, it is difficult to imagine that the Council will fully reopen the debate on points of substance."
"Many of you – I will mention Mr Fava and Mrs Lambert in particular – have brought up a very important issue: the European list of safe countries."
"Well, I am aware that there are problems with the legal basis, and I know that the Council is making a forceful case for having only the consultation procedure apply when the list is drawn up."
"Regardless of the formal legal bases for drawing up the list of safe countries, I believe – and I am personally in favour of this – that it is essential to work with Parliament."
"There are formal legal issues with the legal basis, but there are also substantive political issues. I will mention a variety of subjects: the Agency for Fundamental Rights, the data retention question – in other words, topics on which I have proposed that this Parliament should work within a substantive political, interinstitutional agreement, whatever the formal legal bases."
"Therefore, why should we not also explore the possibility of the Council and Parliament working together on a subject that is clearly sensitive, as Mr Coelho said as well?"
"I frankly agree with many of the comments that have been made: it is difficult to imagine that the Council will now, after four years of negotiations, simply drop the list of safe countries idea."
"Let us try, then, to give it what I see as a political boost that will involve Parliament much more than Parliament has been involved up to now!"
"For these reasons I conclude by hoping once more that you will vote for the directive, since voting for it would mean giving substance to that idea of European solidarity that Mr Busuttil has just recalled: European solidarity means sharing responsibilities and also burdens, and it means standing up to the opinions of those who would like to have exclusively national approaches."
"In my view, Parliament has a chance to give a political response of that kind."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the EU-US Wine Agreement."
". Mr President, I am glad to have the opportunity to address here the question of the European Union-United States Wine Agreement, which was initialled in Washington on 14 September."
"It will be submitted to Council for final approval in the coming weeks."
"This is only a first phase agreement."
"It is the result of many years of bilateral negotiations, during which the United States was granted and renewed specific authorisations on wine-making practices, certification and labelling rules, completely 'for free'."
"These never-ending negotiations affected the trading environment in a negative way."
"The United States left the International Wine Organisation in 2001 and created the World Wine Trade Group."
"Besides that, since the Community revised its labelling rules in 2002 with the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002, the United States has been one of the most critical WTO members, questioning the WTO-compatibility of all these rules."
"Another example of negative trade relations was the adoption by Congress in November 2004 of certification requirements for imported wines, except for countries with which the United States had a wine agreement."
"Community exports to the United States amounted to almost EUR 2 billion in 2004, which is about 40% of our wine exports."
"The United States only exports EUR 415 million to the European Union."
"Considering, therefore, the importance of the United States market for the European Union, the evolution of our trade relations over recent years and the situation in the Community wine sector, it is my view that this first phase agreement is a very positive one for our wine sector."
"This deal will secure what is our biggest export market in terms of both value and volume."
"I welcome the agreement, since it will help consolidate and improve our trading relations with the United States."
"It may also facilitate a non-polemical and substantial dialogue with the members of the New World Wine Group."
"In addition, this first phase agreement contains some provisions that clearly benefit the Community."
"There is now official recognition by the United States of our wine geographical indications, which will be protected under their labelling rules."
"There are the 17 European wine names, such as port, sherry and champagne, which are currently considered as semi-generic in the United States."
"We have agreed that their use will be limited in the United States and that they will change their legal status to restrict them to wines originating in the Community in future."
"The present situation will be frozen, but there will be no further negative impact from the agreement."
"We cannot underestimate the fact that the explicit recognition of these names as Community wines will benefit Community wine-makers and traders."
"We will also be exempted from the 2004 United States certification requirements."
"Not only for wines covered by the agreement, but also for wines which contain less than 7% alcohol, which was an issue of interest to many of the wine-producing Member States."
"And let us not forget that, without the present agreement, we would have faced heavy certification requirements for our 2005 vintage."
"I can assure you that all these requirements would have been very costly for our export sector."
"I wish to highlight two other very important points."
"Under this agreement, the United States and the European Union agree to resolve bilateral issues through informal bilateral consultations, rather than through formal dispute settlement mechanisms."
"This is an important declaration, as it represents a peace clause and will allow further constructive discussions to be held."
"Given that this is only a first phase agreement, it was key to have some clear perspectives for the second and more ambitious phase."
"We have obtained a clear commitment to start the negotiations for the second phase not later than 90 days after the entry into force of the first phase."
"The United States ultimately agreed to spell out more clearly in a joint declaration the issues that should be part of these second phase negotiations."
"These include important issues for us, such as the future of the 'ex' semi-generics, geographical indications, the use of traditional expressions, wines not covered by the agreement, wine-making practices, certification and the creation of a joint committee."
"Lastly, I have heard some criticism to the effect that the Commission has granted the United States mutual recognition of its wine-making practices."
"This is not at all the case."
"We will continue to accept United States wine-making practices currently covered by Community authorisations."
"We will also accept existing United States wine-making practices not covered by the present Community derogations."
"However, it will only be possible for the United States to export those wines after the status of the 17 semi-generic United States names has been changed."
"New wine-making practices will be analysed and only accepted in the Community if no objections are raised."
"This is not mutual recognition."
"Because the United States is our most important trade partner in the wine sector, I consider this first phase agreement a very important one for European wine-makers and exporters."
". Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for her statement on this issue."
"Our group has two points of view on this subject, and I do not propose to mince my words in setting them out."
"The fact is that the Commission has acted – to say the least – shamelessly and unacceptably in making these concessions in the EU-US Wine Agreement, and that I say, as a Member for one of the oldest vine-growing regions in Germany, also on behalf of the vine-growers of the Moselle."
"You yourself stressed the obvious need for a trade agreement with unambiguous rules, and the negotiations have also been going on too long already, but what we need is an agreement with fair conditions for both parties."
"This document, with its long and vague deadlines and, worst of all, the concession of unconditional mutual recognition of oenological processes in wine-making, is a slap in the face for all the efforts the European Union and its Members have put in to legislation on vine products."
"The Commissioner said that there is a need for further discussions, yet we have negotiated for so long that I have to ask why we are putting off such important decisions."
"The production and manufacturing of wine in Europe is subject to clearly defined conditions."
"Adding water to it is something we see is unthinkable and which the consumer would not stand for."
"Are we now to accept that the Americans may add water to wine up to 7%?"
"Modern methods involving the breaking-down of wine into its individual components are a workable proposition these days, but are we, by way of mutual recognition, to accept that it can be put together industrially and any old how?"
"We have no need of synthetic wine!"
"Wine is diverse, its diversity a manifestation of nature itself, owing its character to climate and vintage."
"Is the Commission not aware of the likely effect of such a concession, which affects future agreements, on negotiations within the WTO?"
"The ‘most favoured nation’ principle laid down by the WTO means that, later on, the same concessions will have to be made to other states."
"The International Wine Institute is endeavouring to find a globally valid definition of wine, and this is being taken ."
"Commissioner Fischer Boel also mentioned another organisation."
"The USA has left the OIV."
"Does that mean that the OIV has in some sense gone bust?"
"Yet what we insist we need – the protection of geographical indications of origin without the specification of a date – is simply being put off for ever and a day."
"Champagne comes from Champagne, Rhine wine is grown on the Rhine, and Moselle on the Moselle – not somewhere in America."
"If we want fair trade, then such descriptions must be banned now rather than at some unspecified date."
"Even maintaining the current status quo strikes me as going too far."
"What I want the Commission to tell me is in what sense the negotiations around this agreement can be described as a success; as I see it, all we have done is to make concessions, and too many of them at that."
"I feel – and let me say on behalf of the many winemaking families at present bringing their harvest home from the vineyards, we feel – that a deal has been done to sell us down the river."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking you for presenting the proposal for an agreement and for the clarifications which it was absolutely necessary to give the European Parliament."
"This is a difficult agreement which, I think, was fairly complex, meaning that we all need more clarification."
"On the other hand, you too need to take account of our proposals and concerns in connection with this agreement."
"This agreement might indeed be considered as one of the most long-winded international sectoral trade agreements, given that issues have been pending since 1983."
"Over the last 20 years, the European Union, as you quite rightly said, has constantly granted the USA derogations relating to wine-making practices and the labelling of American wines imported into the Community."
"This agreement will, first of all, smooth trade relations between the USA and the European Union: the USA exempt the European Union from their new certification requirements and undertake to endeavour to resolve possible differences through bilateral consultations rather than, as was previously the case, through dispute settlement mechanisms."
"However, we should not forget that, for the time being, this is only a first phase agreement, what we might call an emergency solution, and that important trade matters are pending which the Commissioner must take into account in the ruthless negotiations now beginning."
"First, protected names are not adequately safeguarded, it would appear, in the agreement, while the recognition given to the wine-making practices of the USA, allowing 7% water to be added or for wines to be matured with wood shavings in the barrel, which are not of course a health hazard, jeopardises the reputation of wine as a quality product."
"Secondly, this recognition of the lax wine-making practices of the USA will act as a precedent for imports from other countries."
"Consequently, in the second phase, the question of wine-making and maturing practices will need to be addressed responsibly, in order to create a stable reference framework."
"Thirdly, traditional names are being threatened and the role of the International Wine Organisation is being questioned."
"Fourthly, the procedure to safeguard recognition of the 17 names in Annex 2 needs to be speeded up, so that all protected European names are strictly protected by the American authorities."
"Fifthly, the creation of an international register of protected geographical indications needs to be promoted within the framework of WTO negotiations and this objective needs to be integrated into the top priorities of the European Union."
"Commissioner, one major cycle is closing but another is beginning and perhaps now the Commission's efforts should be stepped up within the framework of the second round of negotiations with the USA and the forthcoming review of the common organisation of the market for wine, so as to create the best possible conditions with respect to the production and quality of and the trade in the product."
"You are in the eye of the storm and I wish you ."
"Parliament and its comments will, I think, help in this direction."
". Mr President, Commissioner, let me start by expressing my – our – congratulations on your success in achieving this interim result in the negotiations with the United States."
"This is an important trade project, accounting for EUR 2.3 billion, but the trading relationship involves two different systems, with different approaches to production and marketing, and so cooperation is not easy."
"It is for that reason that this agreement can be regarded as no more than a first step, a first phase agreement, and I am glad that you have described it in those terms."
"In the past, we accepted many derogations for the Americans; the trading relationship made that necessary."
"What matters now, though, is that our rules on labelling should be enforced, and we also see it as significant that the USA is ready and willing to resolve all bilateral issues through consultation rather than through the WTO’s dispute settlement procedures, but what is surely most important to us Europeans is that geographical indications of origin should enjoy in the United States the protection that they deserve, in return for which we – for the time being – are prepared to accept the Americans’ winemaking practices."
"That may be a bitter pill, but we have to swallow it; its effect will be only temporary and the labelling rules – which will result in greater freedom for what we hope are emancipated consumers – will help it go down."
"Nevertheless, in the second stage of negotiations, the Commission must go further and press for the improved protection of intellectual property in winemaking, an area in which we Europeans have led the world in establishing worldwide standards, and so we should not relax our efforts on this point; we also suggest that the Commission should push for a WTO-wide register of geographical descriptions of origin, something that both the speakers before me mentioned."
"To sum up, this agreement may not be brilliant, but it is a first, and an important step, and you, Commissioner, have done the right thing."
"The next step must now be taken hand in hand with the reform of the market organisation for wine, to which we all look forward eagerly."
"We can take pride in our European wine."
"It is esteemed and enjoyed the world over."
"We enjoy a global advantage in wine production, and we need to maintain it by further improving the protection of intellectual property."
"We wish you, Commissioner, much success in doing this."
". Mr President, for our part, we refuse to be taken in in the ways mentioned by our fellow Member."
"I would like first of all to emphasise a procedural issue."
"This debate has been hurriedly organised, following the signing of an agreement – even if it is a first phase – by the Commission."
"Furthermore, the Council is not here, although it is the institution that ultimately has the agreement in its hands."
"I believe, therefore, that we are not working in a serious fashion and that the opinion of MEPs is not being taken into consideration, as it ought to be."
"With regard to the content, while this agreement works in the favour of the traders and merchants who exert a great deal of pressure to get ahead, it clearly does not, in any way, serve the interests of either the producers of registered designation of origin wines or of consumers."
"Today, the situation is extremely confused."
"What you have set out, Commissioner, does not correspond to the information we have from another source."
"A state of deep concern is emerging on the ground."
"How much confidence will European consumers have in the labelling, in the labels that are in danger of being considerably undermined by this type of agreement?"
"Furthermore, you are considerably weakening the principles that the European Union has always upheld with regard to geographical indications."
"What is currently taking place with regard to wine, and which is, in our view, unacceptable, is in danger of subsequently taking place with regard to a whole host of other products."
"For our part, we want two things to happen."
"On the one hand, that the Council does its job and clearly states what remit has been given to the Commission regarding this issue."
"On the other hand, that the European Union takes a far greater stand on ensuring that the registered designations of origin are observed, on wine-making practices and on protecting sectors that are genuinely vital to the existence of our territories and to a great number of rural territories throughout the European Union, and that it fights to protect this quality and these designated origins."
"Otherwise, if we embark on the WTO negotiations by giving up from the outset, I very much fear that we will lose ground time and time again in the weeks to come."
". – Mr President, it is well known that the wine sector is going through a difficult time, not least in Portugal where there are increasing numbers of good wines that are having trouble competing in the marketplace. This situation is exacerbated by the increase in third-country imports, which has had a highly detrimental effect on farmers and wine-growing regions."
"This first wine agreement with the United States, the fruit of 20 years of bilateral negotiations, is an important one and yet it also raises concerns."
"In light of the massive concessions given to the United States, this agreement appears to have been brokered more because of the ongoing negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, than for the purpose of defending the interests of EU wine producers."
"We also believe that the scope of the negotiations must be broadened internationally. Furthermore, as regards the United States, Mrs Fischer-Boel must explain fully how she intends to guarantee the interests of wine producers from regions of Europe in which wine production is crucial to economic development."
"With regard to both labelled designations of origin and traditional wine-making practices in Europe, this is what must be done if the quality of wine is to be maintained and consumers are to be protected."
"When we checked the detail and listened to your explanations, we became very concerned as regards the guarantees that must be given to our farmers and to the regions concerned."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent European Union-United States agreement is only a first step – and certainly an inadequate and insufficient one – towards the international recognition and safeguarding of protected traditional names."
"It was time to change course after the harmful effects of the infamous Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which effectively authorised producers in non-EU countries to make improper use of protected traditional names, thus causing enormous damage to quality wine production, both in Italy and, of course, in Europe as a whole."
"Commissioner Fischer Boel also stated in this Chamber that the agreement protects European names and will safeguard the European Union’s largest export market."
"There is no doubt that those are the aims to be achieved; doubt remains, however, as to whether the agreement is the right basis on which to achieve such aims."
"It is indeed true that the US Administration will put a bill before Congress to change the status and limit the use of 17 European names currently considered semi-generic in the United States, but it is also true that the United States will still be able to use 14 Community traditional names, although subject to certain conditions and for a limited period of time."
"In fact, the hoary question of the ongoing misuse of names has still not been settled once and for all."
"On the other hand, the United States has undertaken to accept the basic principles of the Community’s labelling rules and will seek to resolve any bilateral issues relating to the wine trade through informal bilateral consultations rather than through dispute settlement mechanisms."
"What is the most worrying concession made by the European Union?"
"Well, under the agreement, the European Union recognises the wine-making practices of US wine producers."
"Substantially, what that means is that the EU can import wine diluted with 7% of added water or flavoured with wood chips, practices that our producers, of course, are absolutely forbidden to use."
"That will result in a serious threat to wines of excellence and a major upset in the wine market."
"Although we have succeeded in providing a certain stability for wine exports to the United States, not least through the easing of procedures, we have at all events gone too far on wine-making practices and we do not yet have sufficient guarantees regarding the misuse of protected names."
"Mr President, the agreement includes the commitment that negotiations for an even more thorough agreement will start 90 days after it enters into force."
"In this regard, we ask that the talks focus on the effective protection of traditional names."
"We believe that, during the talks, the Commission should above all try to obtain a final commitment from the US authorities to put an end to the illicit use in the United States of geographical indications protected by Community legislation within two years at most."
"I shall conclude by pointing out that the agreement and the extraordinary derogation for US imports could be used by other WTO member states to claim similar treatment, thus opening the floodgates to imports of dubious origin and composition."
"Faced with this situation, the European Union must take action with more vigorous measures in order to defend its production of traditional quality wines."
"We should make a fresh start by actually repealing Regulation (EC) No 316/2004, which liberalised the use of protected traditional names, thus creating unfair competition and misleading consumers as to the origin and quality of products."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I speak on behalf of all my people."
"Firstly, on behalf of the wine growers from the Languedoc-Roussillon region who have been making wine for 2 000 years – since the days of the Roman Empire and not for a century like California – and who make wine like people make love, like people cultivate love for what is handsome and what is beautiful."
"I also speak on behalf of all the wine growers from France, Spain, Rioja, Hungary, Tokay – the wine of kings, the king of wines – Italy, Greece and the entire Mediterranean area, where wine is part of civilisation, an art of the gods."
"Yet you, with your agreement, you are reducing the wine that is the product of civilisation to an industrial product for marketing."
"Your Munich Agreement of the wine industry changes the definition of wine and the nature of wine. It is no longer a natural creation that is the fruit of the fermentation process, but a chemical product."
"You accept the United States’ chemical – and not wine-making – practices."
"You accept a Coca Cola-type of wine made with water plus ingredients, sugar, colourings and wood."
"It is like the United States wanting to change Mrs Fischer Boel into an inauthentic, 7%-dilutable commissioner."
"You can understand, therefore, why the United States does not want labels: because it obviously does not want the chemical substances to be included on them."
"Soon, the REACH Directive will be applied to wine."
"What is more, you are allowing the theft of 17 designations, on the pretext that they are semi-generic."
"Champagne, why, that is insignificant;"
"Chablis, that is not at all significant;"
"Sauternes, even less so!"
"You are giving the rubber stamp to fraud and counterfeiting."
"For five years, the United States will be able to use bogus châteaux and bogus Clos wines in exchange for the peace clause."
"It is like what happened with the Uruguay Round negotiations, it is like what happened with oleaginous fruits: the thief agrees not to drag the cheated wine growers under the nose of the WTO policeman."
"This had already been done before for the agreement with South Africa and, at the WTO, of course, the producers of Chilean, Australian and California wine, and of all the wines from the Pacific, are going to revolt and claim this precedent for themselves."
"Commissioner, I come from a region that invented the great revolts in the 1950s."
"Well, the wine growers from the Languedoc region will say ‘no’ to you."
"They will revolt and they may, for that matter, come to the Commission in Brussels."
"They have been able to rouse the whole of southern France, and they will have no difficulty in saying ‘no’ to you as violently as is necessary, because you are attacking them and you are attacking a civilisation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, although our esteemed visitors in the galleries are most welcome and ought of course to share in the liveliness of the debate, I would ask them to bear in mind that – following the practice of parliaments all over the world – we ask the listeners in the galleries not to applaud."
"Only the Members may do that."
"You may, however, nod energetically, provided this is not audible."
"I thank the visitors in the galleries for their understanding and warmly welcome them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, if I were to be banished to a desert island, in the farthest ocean, which would be the Pacific, and someone were to ask me which European agricultural products I would like to take with me, I would say, apart from bread, two bottles."
"One of those bottles would contain wine, and the other olive oil."
"And since I am from La Rioja, the wine would naturally be a Rioja, which has an international reputation and whose renown and prestige are due to an ancient wine-making culture."
"Since before the Roman invasion, vines were being cultivated in La Rioja and wine was being produced."
"Our wine is therefore produced by means of extremely ancient production methods which guarantee the high quality of the product."
"I therefore believe that the Agreement reached with the United States could lead to a profound change to our wine-making culture, which would not always work to our advantage, because, fortunately or unfortunately, the commercial success of our wines has always been linked to a production method that conforms rigorously to the most purist definitions of the wine."
"The definitive authorisation of the import of wines treated by means of dubious wine-making practices that are very different to ours could jeopardise our own wine-making culture, upon which – I would insist – the commercial success of our products has always been based."
"How long can the European Union go on prohibiting the use of flakes in the maturing of wine or the addition of water, if we are allowing wines produced by means of these practices to be imported?"
"It is clear that the chapter on wine-making processes will be one of the sticking points to which particular attention will be paid in the forthcoming reform of the COM in wine, because the agreement that the European Commission has just reached with the United States will, I fear, have repercussions which will go beyond trade with that country."
"My region, La Rioja, is lucky enough to benefit from good protection in the United States’ market, but the same cannot be said for other Community designations such as Burgundy, Port and Sherry and Málaga wine, which are still considered by that country to be ‘semi-generic’."
"The agreement reached does not contain a firm commitment from the United States to cease misappropriating these descriptions."
"I would therefore like us to call upon the Commission to include the creation of an international register of geographical indications and designations of origin amongst the main priorities of the negotiations in the World Trade Organisation."
"The current negotiations in the World Trade Organisation offer a golden opportunity which we must not waste."
"The Commission should also urge the United States, on a bilateral basis, to stop using names protected in the European Union within the maximum period of two years mentioned in the recent wine Agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that after twenty years of contacts between the European Union and the United States, the first agreement has been reached."
"But we see this just as a starting point and not something with which we should be content. I agree with the majority of what has been said in this Parliament and, above all, I hope that the Commission will take good note because I have not heard a single person say that they are satisfied with this agreement."
"These first agreements do not guarantee effective protection for European designations of origin."
"However, they do leave the Community market open to United States wines produced according to wine-making practices not authorised in the European Union, such as watering."
"It is going to be difficult for our wines, produced according to traditional methods and high-quality criteria, to compete with others produced by means of much cheaper industrial processes."
"My country, Spain, is disappointed by this first agreement and we hope that the second phase will be far more convincing."
"Amongst many other things, we are particularly worried about the issue of semi-generic designations; we believe that it is they who have lost out most."
"It is true that the United States have committed themselves to not using typical European designations, but only for wine that they export to third countries."
"They can therefore continue to use the same descriptions that they have been using to date in their own territory, with the added complication that United States legislation views descriptions from my region, such as ‘Sherry’ and ‘Málaga’, as semi-generic and not designations of origin."
"The second phase of the negotiations will begin shortly; we call on this Parliament to defend the geographical indications more firmly in those negotiations, to which end we must open up a debate on the future of semi-generic terms."
"We need to hold a dialogue on traditional terminology, certifications and wine-making practices and, in particular, it is necessary to create a joint committee for wine-making issues."
"In order to work better in the future than we have until now, this Parliament is prepared to work with the Commission; we are going to adopt a resolution which we must take into account so that what has been happening to us until now does not continue."
"It would also be desirable for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to produce an initiative report so that what has happened does not happen again and so that this Parliament’s opinion is taken into account in order to try to save the European wine-making sector."
"Mr President, the challenges of the wine market are huge."
"The United States remains a key market for the European Union with 60 million wine drinkers and an average level of consumption that has grown from 8 to 13 litres per inhabitant per year over the last ten years."
"Last year, the volume of the US market increased by 5.6%."
"France is ranked third among exporters to the United States, behind Italy and Australia."
"In this context, we must welcome the agreement on wines which has been made between the European Union and the United States and which concludes the first phase of negotiations that were begun 20 years ago."
"Using blackmail, the United States threatened to subject European exporters to an onerous certification procedure."
"This autumn’s therefore, would have been first in line."
"It would have been subjected to additional analysis and certification checks."
"This agreement has also enabled progress to be made in the area of wine-making practices."
"European producers, however, consider these control standards to be insufficient."
"They oppose practices such as flavouring, which is aimed at infusing wine with the taste of fruits."
"The changing way in which we define wine is at stake."
"They also emphasise the protection of geographical designations."
"Commissioner, it is necessary, therefore, in the second phase of negotiation, to ensure that the commitments undertaken by the US authorities are observed: to cease using semi-generic terms, such as Burgundy, Chablis, Champagne and Port, and to improve the level of protection of geographical indications, as well as improving labelling."
"In this global wine market, which is often controlled by the large US wine traders, the type of vine has become a brand name."
"I am not against the globalisation of the wine market, but I am against copies. I am against the standardisation of flavour: I do not want a McDonalds-style Chardonnay wine."
"Wine goes hand-in-hand with cuisine; it is the mark of the region where it was produced, it carries the flavour of the cultivated soil and it is the symbol of festivity and of living together."
"The diversity of the designations reflects the diversity of the wines, our cultural diversity."
"Mutual recognition of the geographical indications, that is to say the designation of the soil from which the wine is produced, will contribute to preserving our respective cultural identities, to boosting our trade with the United States but, above all, to encouraging European wine growers who, for years, have constantly improved the quality of their production in order to satisfy our demands, and serve our enjoyment, as consumers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the agreement between the European Union and the United States on trade in wines, which was initialled by the European Commission on 14 September following 20 years of negotiations, divides opinions."
"There are the European operators for whom this agreement will safeguard their exports to the United States, which is their most important market, with exports valued at EUR 1.6 billion."
"They believe that this agreement will also enable a climate of confidence to be restored in the sector and trade to flow smoothly, provided, of course, that a prompt start is made to negotiations for a second phase of the bilateral agreement and for defining common positions in the multilateral negotiations, particularly in Hong Kong with regard to aspects related to intellectual property."
"Yet there are the other operators too, in particular the European wine growers, including my colleague, Mrs Klass, to whom, moreover, we owe the initiative behind this debate, and for that I offer her my thanks."
"She has expressed very competently the concerns which, as chairman of this Parliament’s ‘Wine, tradition, quality’ intergroup, I share to a very large extent."
"According to these concerns, this agreement is in danger of further aggravating the crisis that is currently hitting the wine-producing sector and, in the long term, of destroying once and for all the individual nature of European wines, which are characterised by their traditional roots in the soil and by natural and quite specific wine-making practices."
"As political men and women, we know that we often have to water down our wine, but please, not the wine that we drink."
"Mutual recognition of the wine-making practices on both sides of the Atlantic poses a problem – my fellow Members have spoken at great length about it – all the more so because some of these practices used by European wine growers are also banned by the WTO."
"I hope that you are not going to propose that we change that state of affairs when you make proposals for reforming the common organisation of the wine market."
"Being traditionally attached to production models in keeping with their environment and subject to an arsenal of stringent Community regulations, European wine growers, who are anxious to deliver quality products, are in danger of ending up in a situation of unfair competition if the United States’s practices are accepted, so much so that, in the long run, they will find themselves forced to abandon their ancestral practices which have, over hundreds of years, created the individual nature of Europe’s wine-making sector."
"Therefore, Commissioner, it would be wise to pull out all the stops in order to protect this sector, which is undoubtedly fragile from being subjected to a large number of varying factors such as the climate but which has always been at the centre of European culture."
"It is therefore a question of continuing to defend and promote our wine-making practices; it is a question of supporting the quality-focused efforts of our producers, in particular at the WTO, and, finally, of agreeing on a definition that restricts the production models that are unacceptable and that give rise, as I have already said, to a kind of competition that is detrimental to our quality products."
"The use of geographical indications is a further issue that unquestionably creates a problem."
"This subject has been provoking controversy around the negotiating table for a long time now."
"I took part in a seminar in Washington on this matter."
"We maintain good relations, in fact, with our colleagues from the US Congress, whom we are trying to convince about the validity of our arguments."
"Yet they wanted us to buy back – to pay in order to buy back – our designations of origin."
"I held the view that the reasoning was, nonetheless, slightly odd."
"I come from Luxembourg, where the Moselle river flows, and the wine from the Moselle valley, while it can be produced in Germany, Luxembourg or France, is emphatically not, as far as I am aware, produced in California."
"I believe, therefore, that there should be an end to the costs and, Commissioner, that it is crucial to protect our designations and to implement, once and for all, a system for registering geographical indications within the WTO."
"We hope that you will vigorously defend this point of view in Hong Kong, because it is a question of the future of quality products and of Europe’s wine-making culture."
"– Mr President, wine production in Europe is not merely a matter of applying techniques learnt in a laboratory or in marketing handbooks to the agronomy sector."
"As earlier speakers have said, winemaking culture and wine production are an integral part of the cultural heritage of a number of European regions and have been part of their history stretching back centuries."
"I should like to refer to just one example, which you will appreciate is very close to my heart, namely that of Port wine. This wine is produced in the world’s oldest specified region, created and regulated long before the American colonies had even thought of coming together to form sovereign states."
"On the steep slopes of the River Douro in Northern Portugal, successive generations have for centuries sculpted the mountains with their bare hands and miraculously transformed the stones of a desolate landscape into a scene of extraordinary beauty, which is now classified as a world heritage site."
"This does not hide the fact that I am well aware of the importance of concluding the agreement with the United States."
"I am aware of the profound impact that European exports have had on that country and of the delicate negotiating framework within which this problem has dragged on for many years."
"Pragmatism at the negotiating table must not be allowed to undermine the need to enshrine basic rules for protecting our designations of origin and geographical indications."
"Under no circumstances must the Commission neglect the issue of protecting semi-generic names in the US internal market."
"A specific date must be set for the signing of a final commitment."
"The next phase of the negotiations must get underway without delay so that the 17 designations of origin in Annex II can be accorded recognition."
"I sincerely hope that the disappointing outcome of this first phase of negotiations can be offset by the second round, which we hope to see concluded swiftly."
"A fair and balanced agreement with the United States could be the positive sign that European winemaking, currently facing a number of tricky challenges, is urgently looking for."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am an MEP from the great Eastern France, a region that produces Burgundy, the wine of Alsace – Alsace, where we are today – and, of course, Champagne."
"I have a duty, as an MEP who is, indeed, from the Champagne region, to inform you of the following observations, since the essence of today’s debate is the start of the agreement you spoke of, Commissioner, and which you obviously wish to finalise."
"While we too wish for it to be finalised, it is for the reasons that I am going to expand on."
"There is an economic necessity underpinning all of this."
"The US market, as has been pointed out several times since it was mentioned earlier, is extremely important for Europeans."
"In this age of globalisation, however, I would like to focus my remarks on issues related to quality."
"At international level, UNESCO regularly acknowledges a number of our sites of interest and buildings among the world heritage sites."
"Well, European wines, particularly those produced around the Mediterranean, as was pointed out earlier, have established their pedigree throughout the centuries and millennia."
"In an age when, at every important moment, when a peace agreement is signed, when a family party is celebrated, etc., it is wine and, moreover, quality wine that is consumed, quality must be recognised."
"Yet, what has been taking place for some decades now?"
"We have been witnessing the spread of plantations throughout the world – in Chile, in Australia, in New Zealand – and, above all, and this is what is fuelling the debate this morning, an explosion of ‘Canada Dry’."
"People are reproducing wines left, right and centre throughout the world, quoting denominations on the labels that allude to the vine and the region in which the wines were produced – Champagne, Bordeaux, Porto, etc. – and they are trying to make consumers believe that, in the bottle they are buying, they have a wine whose origin and quality matches what the labelling would suggest."
"Commissioner, this agreement that you are going to finalise in the weeks and months to come must prevent consumers throughout the world from feeling cheated and deceived."
"We live in an age where the volume of counterfeit products is multiplying; we can see this taking place in the case of clothing items, with Lacoste, in the case of watches, with Rolex, and also, unfortunately, in the case of medicines."
"It is quite normal, natural and necessary that consumers throughout the world should be certain that a bottle of wine bearing the words ‘wine of Alsace’, ‘Burgundy’ ‘Champagne’ or ‘Port’ does indeed contain the wine in question."
"The quality of our world heritage is at stake, as are the interests of all our European wine producers."
"Long live European wine!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for wanting to start the second phase."
"You have talked about a first phase agreement on the issue, and you have talked about a second phase that will take into due consideration a number of factors that we wish to emphasise, regarding quality, wholesomeness, protection and tradition."
"Commissioner, the European Union has always pursued a policy of quality in the wine sector by means of very specific and very selective rules on wine content and wine-making procedures."
"How can we now ask our producers to comply with Community rules and the Community’s quality policy if we then give third countries the chance to export to our market products that the Community itself forbids its own producers to make?"
"How can we ask our producers to compete on price with imports that benefit from production costs that are held down through the use of production practices that appreciably impair quality?"
"Quality above all means guaranteeing a wholesome product for the consumer: food safety is for us a priority that we have vigorously pursued and have regulated more than once;"
"The positive effects of wine on human health are now well known: they depend not just on its organoleptic properties but on its hygienic and sanitary status as well."
"The lack of any indication of origin of the wine, moreover, means that the consumer cannot identify it, and it also leads to difficulties for producers who incur extra costs in order to make a superior quality product."
"It is our job to ensure that the wine on our tables – on the tables of European consumers – is both wholesome and good quality."
"Our wine-making traditions, Commissioner, are no less important."
"This morning we have invoked our ancient culture, our specialities and our territorial diversity."
"In a word, it means ensuring that the geographical indications for our wines are respected and that our production in this sector thereby remains competitive."
"I do not see sufficient protection for our geographical indications in this agreement;"
"I do not find it consistent with the position that the European Union is advancing in the WTO negotiations; and I do not find in it that same firmness of resolve that you yourself, Commissioner, reaffirmed last week in the Council."
"If we want to protect our indications in the Doha Round, we must do so, particularly through bilateral negotiations, without making any concessions."
"The agreement does not respect our producers; it does not respect our consumers; it does not respect our market; and it does not respect the European Union’s identity on the international stage."
"It is not a case of closing the market – far from it – but of ensuring fair, undistorted competition, in which both product quality and consumer protection really can prevail."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union-United States wine agreement provides a stable legal framework for our trading relations and is therefore a worthwhile step forwards."
"I am pleased to tell Commissioner Fischer Boel that I acknowledge its merits."
"Like many other Members of this House, I consider it essential that in phase two the Commission does not lose sight of the priorities for the Community market, which are to ensure definitive results regarding the protection of denominations of origin and regarding the restrictions to be placed on the recognition of wine-making practices."
"I believe my fellow Members’ concerns on this matter are justified and I trust that, through close dialogue with Parliament, the Commission will press for these objectives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are all agreed that wine is among agriculture’s most elegant products."
"Some 265 million hectolitres of wine are produced every year, two-thirds of them in Europe."
"The Wine Agreement between the EU and the USA is first to be concluded with the object of securing this important market for sales from the EU."
"The intention is that this agreement should dispel the legal uncertainty that has marked this trading relationship for many years, and it was designed to benefit producers on both sides of the Atlantic."
"The conclusion of this first agreement is meant to create the conditions for future close cooperation with the USA in the wine sector and protect designations of origin in the EU."
"The Commissioner herself described this agreement as an important first step, and said that it is still not without faults."
"Like the other Members, I am much obliged to her for this statement."
"The European Union is doing something it has never done before by agreeing to the principle of the unconditional recognition of oenological processes."
"The Member States had hitherto always argued that there should be what they termed an international code of definitions for wine and the processes involved in its manufacture."
"It is for that reason that I believe doing this puts a question mark against the continued existence of the international organisation, the OIV."
"As far as the protection of European designations of geographical origin is concerned, the concessions made in this agreement go too far."
"They affect all those regions that base their quality systems on designations of origin or traditional terminology."
"While there is no doubt that we need a trade agreement with the USA, what we need is an agreement with unambiguous legal provisions that do not undermine existing European law and requirements and offer a secure future to our European high-quality wines."
"There is to be another round of negotiations once the first agreement has been in force for ninety days."
"I believe that this approach is absolutely right, proper and necessary, and I hope that the decisions taken then will make it possible for us to withdraw the criticisms we have expressed today."
"All the best, Commissioner!"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs Klass and Mrs Herranz Garcia for bringing this subject to the Chamber so promptly, thus giving it the importance it deserves."
"Wine is one of the products that is facing increased international competition as a result of the globalisation and liberalisation of the markets."
"Wine is one of the few success stories that we can enjoy in Europe."
"Our designations of origin are the fruit of centuries of tradition and form part of a culture for which wine is one of the major flag-bearers."
"At this point, it is worth mentioning the Doha Declaration and the WTO General Council statement of 31 July 2004 in Geneva, which introduced the concept of ‘non-trade concerns’."
"These aspects, which one might call non-quantitative, must be taken on board in any agreement, including this agreement with the United States, a country that imports 40% of our wine exports. If so, they should guarantee that when the negotiations are over we can rest assured that the door will not be left ajar for future restrictions in other negotiations with third countries, either on a bilateral basis, or with the WTO."
"For there to be a fair agreement, it is not enough simply to liberalise."
"Rules on quality must be put in place, because our designations of wine origin represent what is referred to as intellectual property, something that requires protection in the same way as copyright."
"This first agreement was concluded, in my view, with little transparency and with Parliament somewhat pushed aside."
"We therefore need to know what the United States actually accepts in terms of our wines with designation of origin."
"For example, from what I have read in the newspapers, we do not know whether or not Madeira wine and Port wine are included among those that the United States accepts as designations of origin."
"We are prepared to make some concessions and adjustments to winemaking practices, but we cannot accept the idea that our designations of origin, which are genuine intellectual property and which characterise our culture even more than trade, are not respected in full."
"To conclude, I therefore feel that if an agreement is necessary – and I accept the need for one – then such an agreement must not be at any cost, and especially not at the cost of our traditions and our culture when it comes to designations of origin."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the only reason I can imagine for your self-satisfaction with the signature of this Agreement is the fact that it has brought to an end twenty years of negotiations and that the United States absorb 40% of the external market in our wines."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, in the first phase, the United States have achieved 100% of their wishes and we have left Europe’s interests for the second phase."
"Our adversary in the negotiation has once again been paid in advance."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, we have lost our main weapon in this contest."
"The main weapon available to us if we were not to accept the wine-making practices of the United States was, precisely, that our designations of origin should be recognised, and we have lost that weapon."
"We have paid and we have ended up without the weapon which could have provided us with ammunition with which to defend our interests."
"Furthermore, we are running the risk that, from now on, certain Community producers may also call for greater flexibility in the Community rules on wine-making practices, which could lead to unwanted changes and put an end to our ancient wine-making culture for good."
"Commissioner, I am also thinking of certain designations that are so emblematic in my country, such as Sherry or Málaga."
"What will happen to them?"
"What is going to happen during the second phase of the negotiation?"
"For all of these reasons, I believe that it is rather shameful that the European Union should surrender to the United States’ wishes as a result of threats."
"They have threatened us with closing our markets and we have given in."
"And we have not achieved what we really wanted: to defend our designations of origin once and for all."
"I believe, Commissioner, that we must be firmer in our negotiations, that we must learn from others and not pay in advance, and above all, that we must not pay with the money of the European producers."
"Before I call the Commissioner, perhaps I might be permitted a personal comment."
"I have been a Member of this House for some time, and rarely have I experienced such an interesting and committed debate, but it is one that I also regard as an example of Europeanisation and globalisation."
"Only a few years ago, when we spoke in terms of ‘us’, each of us meant his or her own nation, and, even so, we had exactly the same problems with mutual recognition, designations of origin, certification, and mandatory labelling."
"All these things we once fought long and hard to secure for Europe, and now it seems that we have to do the same again for a global market that has shrunk."
"The American Professor Jeremy Rifkin is quite right to say that Europeans are best equipped, by reason of these laborious experiences of things that the world is now having to get to grips with, to deal with these problems, for we have been through them already and know how they need to be addressed."
"Now, Commissioner, we are all agog to learn how you propose to sort out the problems with wine."
"Everyone present – including the spectators – knows how important wine is to their own winegrowers."
"How, then, Commissioner, are we to solve these problems?"
". Mr President, I am very encouraged by all the contributions made on this very important issue."
"As I mentioned in my statement, I welcome the conclusion of the first phase agreement on trade in wine between the European Community and the United States."
"I welcome the conclusion of this agreement on trade between the European Community – which, as many of you have mentioned, is the birthplace of wine – and one of the leading countries in the New World Wine Trade Group."
"I am convinced this development is positive not only for the Community and the United States, but also for the world at large."
"I am also convinced that the conclusion of this first phase agreement will pave the way for further discussions and cooperation with the United States in the wine sector, which is in the clear interest of the Community, and in particular its wine sector."
"At the same time, I have taken note of all your remarks, which I will not underestimate."
"The negotiations for the second phase, which as I mentioned previously will begin within 90 days of the entry into force of the agreement, will allow us to act on many of the remarks made today."
"However, I also believe that most of your remarks go far beyond the conclusion of this first phase agreement and in a sense confirm that it is the right moment to start the analysis and discussions on reform of the wine sector."
"I should now like to reply to some specific questions."
"Some of you seem to be of the opinion that this agreement is unbalanced and skewed in favour of United States stakeholders."
"Considering the economic pattern of the EC-US wine trade and the political and legal background, this first-phase agreement is not unbalanced."
"It improves our relations with our leading customer considerably and establishes a good basis for future discussions and negotiations."
"Besides, several provisions of key interest to the United States, such as the approval of their existing wine-making practices not covered by current Community authorisations and much simplified certification requirements, will only kick in once the United States has notified the Community it has changed the status of the 17 famous European wine names that are semi-generics in the US."
"There is the question of the protection afforded to European wine names being insufficient."
"The protection under this agreement is afforded through US labelling rules and guarantees that European wine names will only be used for European wines, notwithstanding a grandfathering clause on existing brand names."
"In addition, this agreement is without prejudice to our rights under TRIPs and does not affect our legislative framework for GIs."
"On the most-favoured nation risks mentioned by several of you, I can state that the Commission's aim in these negotiations and those with other new wine-producing countries, is to improve the dialogue between us and our negotiating partners and avoid the trade conflicts and WTO panels that would be extremely costly for European producers."
"The most favoured nation clause is well-known with regard to tariffs, but the situation is completely different when it comes to its application in relation to procedures for recognising wine-making practices."
"In order for the same concessions to be granted to another third country, that third country would have to be in a similar situation as regards acceptable wine-making practices and monitoring of those practices and of the wine."
"However, the United States system of administration for wine labels is unique."
"It is not used in other third countries and the most favoured nation risk therefore seems to be very small."
"That is an important point."
"As regards the possibility of adding water, let me recall that this is permitted today in the European Union for reasons of technical necessity."
"We have no defined limits for the addition of water to wine, but, for example, a limit of 7% has been defined in respect of adding water to concentrated grapes, as it is impossible to detect the addition of water below that threshold."
"But make no mistake, we will not accept any undermining of the quality of EU products."
"On the question of mutual recognition, as I said in my introductory statement this agreement does not grant the United States mutual recognition of its wine-making practices."
"This was one of the key US objectives, just as the phasing-out of semi-generics was for us."
"However, since the US did not agree to phase out the use of the 17 EU semi-generic wine names used in the US, we did not agree to grant them mutual recognition of their wine-making practices."
"As I said, we will only maintain the existing Community authorisations on United States wine-making practices."
"We will accept the other existing US wine-making practices only when the United States has changed the status of our semi-generics."
"That link has to be taken into consideration."
"We will have the possibility, for new wine-making practices, to raise objections and hence not to accept new US wine-making practices."
"We will not simply accept all the practices used by the United States."
"However, various myths seem to abound."
"To take the example of oak chips, which have often been referred to, such chips are already permitted in the European Union on an experimental basis."
"Clearly, however, under the agreement, a wine will have to be aged in oak barrels before the term 'barrel-aged' could be used on the label."
"That goes without saying."
"Finally, it is very important that discussions be opened on the reform of the common market organisation in wine."
"The impact assessment work has already started and consists amongst other things of an economic analysis of the sector, which should be completed by the end of the year."
"Later, the impact assessment report will cover several options and the effects of those options."
"The Commission will involve all stakeholders within the sector in a public debate that will hopefully be held in February, before presenting a proposal."
"The Commission communication could be submitted by June next year, with a Commission legislative proposal being presented before the end of next year."
"I should inform Mr Freitas that both madeira and port are on the list of the 17 wine names considered as semi-generic, and that the use of those names will therefore be restricted."
"He can be quite sure about that."
"Finally, the whole issue of geographical indications is of huge importance to the Community and I have constantly made this clear to our trading partners in the WTO negotiations."
"Our intention has been to obtain a multilateral register, the extension of the existing higher level of protection afforded to wines and spirits to other products, and a clawing-back of certain names, the use of which has been abused world-wide."
"Some of our trading partners even consider that GIs are not an issue for negotiation."
"Something on GIs must come out of our final discussions in Hong Kong."
"It is such a vital issue for the agricultural sector."
"We all hope that you will succeed in defending Europeans’ interests on this occasion."
"At the close of this debate I have received six motions for a resolution(1) submitted pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is therefore closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 29 September, at 12 noon."
"The sitting will now be suspended until the beginning of the vote."
"To those who may be asking why we are doing this rather earlier than usual, I will say that the Bureau has discussed how we might avoid the situation that always occurs at 12.00, 12.05 or 12.10 p.m., with the representatives of the Council of Ministers or the Commission having to talk rather over the noise of all the Members pouring into the Chamber for the vote."
"We have therefore agreed to experiment with closing the debate at 11.50 a.m., so that the debate can proceed without disturbance."
"It is for that reason that we now have a bit more time than usual."
"We are going to begin our voting session, with which our friends from Bulgaria and Romania shall become acquainted for the first time."
"Mr Zappalà, I give you the floor on the basis of Rule 131(4)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the content is quite simple: when this directive was being drawn up, a discrepancy arose between Articles 7 and 8 and Article 78, and today we are putting it right."
"This directive obviously affects a large part of the economy in the Europe of 25 Member States. Therefore, we who dealt with this legislation at the time are envisaging setting up a major investigation next spring to examine its implementation within the Member States and, where appropriate, to study any impact this legislation has had and hence the progress it has made within the European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to make reference to the principle whereby Parliament defends democracy and the rules of the constitutional state."
"While we know that the Constitution of Cyprus provides that, before the public prosecutor of the Republic of Cyprus may address Parliament, he must ask for the opinion of the Supreme Court, we have to check that he has done so."
"It has been said that he did not do so."
"I do not believe that Parliament can vote in favour of a motion that contradicts the legal order of the Member State."
"Mr Geremek, simply out of courtesy to you, I am going to consider your speech to be a personal statement, but you cannot resume the debate at this stage."
"I give the floor once again to the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and ask him not to reopen the debate, as this is voting time."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to explain what Mr Geremek has said."
"The very simple reason behind it is that the Cypriot constitution includes a provision on the suspension of the immunity of members of the national parliament that is not to be found in the constitutions of other Member States."
"In Cyprus, it is not the parliament that rules on suspension, but the Supreme Court."
"As Mr Matsakis is a Member of the European Parliament, though, it is clear that, in accordance with the protocol on privileges and immunities, it is of course not the Supreme Court of Cyprus that is competent to rule on his suspension, but this plenary, that is to say, those who are assembled here today."
"It was for this reason that the Committee on Legal Affairs, saving only one vote to the contrary, took the view that the proposal should be put to the House in its present form."
"I ask you to endorse it."
"Thank you for that clarification."
"I am not accepting any more speeches; I am sorry, but we are in the middle of voting."
"Moreover, I will resume voting time without delay."
"Mr President, I rise on a point of order under Rule 166."
"You know as well as I do that, no matter what the colour of your politics in this place, there is one factor that uniquely unites nearly all of us: whether black, blue, yellow, red or green, we all try our best to represent the people who kindly gave us this job."
"In my region, the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, in the last election voters experimented and tried a different colour."
"Indoctrinated by old adverts and TV celebrity, they believed that, as we say in the UK, the future is bright, the future is orange."
"A few months later and alas, one of our new representatives disappeared from the scene and from this Parliament."
"There are many concerns for his safety: some believed he had been kidnapped, others that he was a relative of Lord Lucan."
"I ran a competition in the East Midlands offering a bottle of champagne for the first confirmed sighting of my illustrious but missing colleague Mr Robert Kilroy-Silk."
"Alas, to this day the champagne remains unclaimed, and so as an unclaimed prize, I believe I should give it to the man himself."
"Here is the said bottle of champagne."
"After that short interlude, we will now be able to carry on with our votes. However, do not abuse the patience of the President of the sitting."
". I voted in favour of the report both for reasons of substance – its content and purpose – and because of the urgent need for it to be adopted."
"The good proposals for directives on the table will be rendered pointless unless Article 78 is amended."
"I feel, however, that the need for a clear, simplified legal framework, one that is consistent on the subject of public contracts, is sufficient grounds for adopting this proposal at the earliest possible opportunity."
". I very much welcome the result of the vote on the correction of Directive 2004/18/EC of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts."
"In order to adjust threshold values in the award of public works contracts, the correction of this clerical error was necessary."
"I would however like to observe that there is still, in my view, a need for improvement in the substance of some of the Directive’s provisions, particularly in those relating to cooperation between municipalities and to the establishment of associations for a particular purpose by boroughs."
"Mandatory tendering for such forms of cooperation is not practical, goes against the objectives of the directive and prevents boroughs from providing public-friendly services at a reasonable price."
"I therefore regard it as urgently necessary that the directive be revised on the basis of practical experience at the beginning of 2006 in order to give attention to this matter."
"I am glad that the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection has already decided to consult interested parties about this."
". I voted in favour of the Costa report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Bulgaria on certain aspects of air services."
"The various bilateral agreements established in the field of air services are the main instruments whereby we can guarantee that our relations with third countries run smoothly, with particular regard to aviation safety."
"Accordingly, and in light of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Community’s exclusive competence in this area, the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries aimed at replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement."
"In Bulgaria’s case, the amendments proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and deal with taxation on air fuel, clauses on designation and pricing, and there is nothing in these areas to which we object."
". I voted in favour of the Costa report on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Croatia on certain aspects of air services."
"The various bilateral agreements established in the field of air services are the main instruments whereby we can guarantee that our relations with third countries run smoothly, with particular regard to issues of aviation safety."
"Accordingly, and in light of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Community’s exclusive competence in this area, the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries aimed at replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement."
"In Croatia’s case, the amendments proposed by Parliament are corrective in character and deal with taxation on air fuel, clauses on designation and pricing, and there is nothing in these areas to which we object."
"The financial effect of the proposal to increase the fees payable to the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has not yet been established."
"The proposal will in any case have consequences for budget headings 3 and 2 of the new financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"We are, on principle, unfavourably disposed to the EMEA being strengthened as an authority and being given an increased budget."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
". The Florenz report on fees payable to the European Medicines Agency is a good example of the way in which we should take on board the experience and the evaluations carried out by the Community’s agencies."
"The report before us follows a significant change in the powers of this Agency, which have not merely been changed but have in fact been extended."
"It is therefore of vital importance that this Agency be given a solid and up-to-date financial framework."
"The purpose of the amendments that were tabled was to clarify the principle of setting the fees payable to the Agency and reducing rates for traditional herbal medicinal products."
"Accordingly, the rapporteur’s position is that the level of the fee should be commensurate with the actual workload involved in evaluating the products."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Florenz report on fees payable to the European Medicines Agency."
"EU fisheries policy should be aimed at guaranteeing abundant fish stocks, quality food products for consumers and sound basic conditions for the European fishing industry."
"EU fisheries policy has unfortunately been turned into a permanent policy for subsidising an unprofitable fishing industry that cannot survive by its own unaided efforts and without aid policy guaranteeing the fish stocks."
"This prevents structures from being rationalised but not the depletion of stocks."
"At the same time, the Icelandic example, with its developed ownership of fishing rights, shows that there are other methods that both protect fish stocks and help the industry adapt to new basic conditions."
"Fisheries policy does not need to be aid policy."
"EU fisheries policy should seek new directions whereby fish stocks are secured from depletion and, at the same time, the fishing industry is restructured."
". The new fisheries protocol between the EU and the Comoros for the period 2005 to 2010 is the logical and predictable development of the previous agreement, and differs little from it."
"Following the very good level of utilisation of fishing opportunities between 2001 and 2004, the new protocol proposes a reduction in the total number of vessels, despite an increase in the permitted annual catch from 4 670 to 6 000 tonnes."
"In keeping with other fisheries agreements with Indian Ocean countries, the agreement between the EU and the Comoros is of great importance to the Community’s tuna fishing sector, as it will equip the sector with the resources to meet the demands of the Community market."
"Although the rapporteur has produced an excellent report, which I broadly support, I must point out that the new agreement reduces the number of Portuguese longliners licensed to fish in the area covered by the agreement."
"I must also register my dismay at the Commission’s failure to consult the Portuguese sector in the course of the negotiations relating to the proposal before us."
". The new protocol for the fisheries agreement with the Comoros will be in force between 2005 and 2010."
"It differs little from the previous protocol (2001 to 2004), which has been extended for ten months."
"The adoption of this agreement will make it possible to provide fishing opportunities to Member State fleets operating in these waters, including Portugal."
"From the EU side, it is calculated that each EUR invested by the Community in the agreement generated an added value of EUR 5.7, an impressive return on investment."
"The number of purse seiners remains the same (21 Spanish vessels, 18 French and 1 Italian), while the number of longliners decreases from 25 to 17 (12 from Spain and 5 from Portugal)."
"This is due to the low level of utilisation during the previous protocol, which demonstrates that the distant water fleet has become ever smaller, as evidenced by the negligible size of the Portuguese distant-water fleet."
"This protocol increases contributions from shipowners by 40% from EUR 25 to EUR 35 per tonne, and cuts the Community’s contribution. We find this unacceptable, as the Commission stated its intention to negotiate future protocols with other countries at the same rate for shipowners."
". The new protocol setting out tuna fishing opportunities concluded between the Community and the Comoros for the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2010 has raised a number of questions for Member States with fishing fleets as regards its viability."
"Having followed the process carefully, I was struck by the fact that the negotiations did not involve consultation with the sector."
"The Commission has taken this criticism on board and has reiterated the huge importance of continuing and stepping up dialogue with the fisheries industry within the framework of the partnership agreements."
"The Commission has also stated its intention to hold talks with the tuna sector in autumn 2005, to address all of the relevant issues to the sector."
"I should like to highlight the fact that the financial contribution has gone up from EUR 350 250 to EUR 390 000 per year. More importantly, 60% of this amount is earmarked for measures designed to support the development of local fisheries."
"I therefore have no objections to the rapporteur’s proposals."
"We approve of the initiative taken by the Council concerning the retention of telecommunication data for the purpose of giving the law enforcement authorities better tools in the fight against serious crime and terrorism."
"Experience in Sweden shows that telecommunication data has been important in many serious crime investigations."
"We therefore support the Council’s proposal in principle."
"The proposal presented by the Commission on 21 September 2005 concerning the retention of telecommunication data opens the way for a debate on combating crime."
"The Commission’s proposal would give the European Parliament influence."
"We therefore chose to abstain in today’s vote in anticipation of a new position being adopted."
"We believe that the initiative by, for example, the Swedish Government on the retention of data processed and stored in connection with the provision of services such as telephone communications, text messaging, e-mail and the Internet etc for the purpose of combating terrorism and other cross-border crimes goes much too far in relation to the expected benefits."
"The Member States should facilitate the exchange of information between each other in order more efficiently to combat these crimes."
"That does not, however, require harmonisation involving uniform rules governing the way in which this huge quantity of data is collected."
"In fact, the proposal gives rise to considerable misgivings about people’s legal certainty and is also in danger of entailing significant costs for the service operators."
"In spite of its criticism, the report states, however, that harmonisation in this area is necessary but that legislation must take place not, as is currently the case, on the basis of intergovernmental cooperation but on the initiative of the Commission and through codecision on the part of Parliament."
"The June List does not share that view."
". We backed the proposal to reject this initiative, which, using the ‘fight against terrorism’ as its pretext, is an attack on the citizens’ fundamental freedoms, rights and guarantees."
"The purpose of this proposal is to store communications data (telephone, SMS and e-mail) indiscriminately, systematically, and, from what we can gather, without any checks and balances."
"As the rapporteur points out, this is an inappropriate and unnecessary proposal, which breaches the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"Quite apart from the countless doubts and questions as to the actual scope and effectiveness of this measure, this measure would, as far as the rapporteur is concerned, be tantamount to storing four million kilometres’ worth of files."
"It is worth noting that this is not the first time Parliament has rejected such an initiative."
"Yet the British Presidency and the Commission, despite widespread criticism, have presented fresh initiatives in this area this week."
"Portuguese law provides for a security system which, in conjunction with the judiciary, already includes a balanced range of measures, rules and controls."
"If the system is used judiciously and rigorously, and assuming it is given the required human resources, it will certainly be capable of combating crime, even the most organised crime, effectively."
".At a time when several European countries are in the grip of the terrorist threat, it is unthinkable that the Member States should be called on to withdraw an initiative that is intended to ensure more effective cooperation, in order to ward off, trace, detect and pursue the perpetrators of terrorist acts and their accomplices."
"To reject this initiative solely on the grounds that it comes from the Member States and not from the Commission is irresponsible, given what is at stake: protecting the safety of our fellow citizens."
"Once again, this report is guided not by the interests of the general public, but by ideological considerations, with an attempt made, without revising the Treaties, to deprive the Member States of their powers more and more each day for the benefit of the Commission."
"Being unable to rely on the people in the wake of the French and Dutch referenda, the supranational institutions of the Union seem to have embarked on a quest, outside the Treaties, to gradually seize the Member States’ powers, following the example of the landmark ruling pronounced on 13 September 2005 by the Court of Justice, which precisely authorises the Commission to legislate on criminal matters."
"Finally, in the face of the terrorist threat, how useful are these delaying tactics based on a would-be breach of Community law, proportionality or the presumption of innocence?"
"That is why we have voted against this report."
". The practical usefulness of the proposal for the EU-wide storage of communications data is very much a matter of doubt."
"The blanket monitoring of all telephone calls, -mails and text messages without any well-founded suspicion cannot be justified on the grounds that it might, under certain circumstances, with a little bit of luck, or at some unspecified point in time, perhaps, help with the investigation of a terrorist attack."
"To do so would be to accumulate an unimaginable mass of data, which, if the worst came to the worst, hard-pressed investigators would have to work through with a fine-tooth comb."
"What is lacking is a well thought-out definition of which items of information are actually of use for the purpose of efficient and successful cooperation, resulting in an excessively comprehensive list which leaves too much room for interpretation."
"Nor has sufficient attention been given to how this would be implemented in practice."
"It is small and medium-sized enterprises that will be particularly hard hit by this initiative, for they lack the organisation and funding to cope with such mandatory storage."
"What is particularly questionable is why there is no explanation of how industry is to be reimbursed its costs – which are expected to run to several hundred million euros – by the individual Member States."
"The draft is legally dubious, may well be contrary to various constitutions, and runs counter to the EU’s declared goal of becoming an area of freedom."
"It is also objectionable when, for the sake of preventing young people from being radicalised, there is control and censorship of the electronic media, while, at the same time, people are assured, in all seriousness, that the freedom of the press and the media are not being compromised – that is reminiscent of George Orwell."
". My vote on the retention of data report reflects both my feeling as a London MEP that there is a necessity for the security services to have the most effective powers available to combat terrorism and protect the public."
"In developing important retention of data powers, it is equally important to ensure that the powers are workable, are developed in close partnership with Internet Service Providers and that we achieve proportionality in relation to how long data can be retained."
"It is clear in the light of the London Bombings that my own Government wanted to see effective powers to tackle terrorism and as a London MEP, I want to ensure these powers are both effective and proportionate, and that they help to the UK public safe."
"I am broadly in favour of the thrust of the proposal tabled by the four Member States, and share the concerns expressed therein. I also feel that, overall, it does not contain anything excessive or disproportionate."
"Nevertheless, I voted in favour of the report proposing the rejection of the proposal by the four Member States, because while I welcomed the thrust of the proposal, the Commission is soon to present a thorough, comprehensive proposal on this issue, and I believe that this is the right way to make law on this issue."
"At the present time, security must not be confused with securitarianism."
"The retention of communications traffic data is not at all the same as bugging telephone calls; it is simply a matter of retaining the minimum amount needed for effective criminal investigation."
"Although the strength of this measure does not specifically lie in prevention – although this element is a part of it – its usefulness in terms of criminal investigation is clear for all to see."
"Accordingly, let us now hope that the Commission justifies the trust placed in it and, at the earliest opportunity, presents the proposal required to regulate this important area."
"Mr President, the introduction of a list of safe countries is a step in the right direction if we are to have a common minimum policy on managing the flow of refugees to Europe."
"A minimum policy is all it should be, though, for the ultimate powers of decision on the recognition and admission of political refugees should still rest with the Member States."
"That is why it is necessary for Member States to have the right and option, alongside the European list of safe countries, to use their own lists."
"The rapporteur vehemently refuses to recognise this possibility, though."
"This report has, in fact, one goal and one goal only, and that is to undermine the very principle of the list of safe countries. That being the case, it will not come as a surprise to you that my colleagues and I voted against it."
"The June List believes that the Member States themselves should be free to decide the shape of their immigration and asylum policies as long as these are in accordance with current international law."
"We do not wish to help create a Fortress Europe. Nor should it be for the European Parliament to lay down which laws should apply in this area."
"We cannot therefore support the Council’s proposal, be it with or without the changes proposed by the report, and we have thus abstained from voting since the directive is part and parcel of devising a common policy for this area."
"We have however voted in favour of many of the committee’s amendments in order to emphasise our support for a refugee policy that is more humane than that expressed in the Council directive and that fulfils current standards laid down in international conventions."
". This proposal for a directive represents the first step on the road to harmonising the asylum process at EU Member State level."
"As our Group has pointed out, Parliament’s report sets in stone some of the worst aspects of the agreement reached by the Council on the same proposal, such as the removal of the ‘super safe country’ concept, which is criticised by the United Nations Commission for Refugees, and the possibility of appeal in the event of an asylum application being refused and the applicant being allowed to remain in the country until the appeal process has been completed."
"The amendments tabled by our Group and our vote in plenary, however, are further attempts to remove other negative aspects, including:"
"- the rejection of a period of detention for asylum seekers, especially in ‘detention centres’ for illegal immigrants;"
"- the rejection of the concept of ‘safe third country’, because the analysis of a period of asylum should take account of each individual case; consequently, the idea of setting up an arbitrary list of countries should be rejected."
"After all, on what criteria should such a list be based?"
". This report forms the framework for the European Union's common position on the sensitive question of dealing with the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status."
"Despite the fact that the EPLP still have certain reservations concerning the Kreissl-Dörfler report, British Labour MEPs voted to support the report in the final vote."
"We do so safe in the knowledge that any outstanding concerns or problems will be rectified by national governments in Council during the implementation stage of the new procedures."
"We remain confident that a balance can be found in Council on the basis of some of the recommendations made under the consultation procedure in Mr Kreissl-Dörfler's report."
", . In general, we have to conclude that the report is in many areas a vast improvement on the Commission proposal."
"During Mrs Liotard’s visit to the Italian refugee camp on the island of Lampedusa on 27 and 28 June 2005, she was able to see for herself how important it is for refugees to have specific rights."
"If an EU Treaty can do something to improve the situation of those people, then we are in favour of such improvement."
"We still have major misgivings about some sections of the Commission proposal, though, including, for example, the concept of ‘safe third countries’."
"We have, unfortunately, been obliged to choose between the devil and the deep blue sea, so, despite these concerns, we will nevertheless vote in favour of the amended proposal, because it can vastly improve the position of asylum seekers, because Amnesty International was relatively positive about it, and because we hope that it will put an end to the disgraceful Lampedusas of Europe."
". This is an important and welcome report as it allows directly-elected representatives at the European Parliament to have their say on a crucial Civil Liberties issue following the political agreement reached by the Member States governments in Council."
"I sympathise with the Rapporteur's view that international standards for the protection of refugees (including the 1951 Geneva Convention) should not be undermined and fully endorse the role of Parliamentarians in scrutinising the amendments proposed by the Council."
"Nevertheless, given the fast changing international climate, the need for some flexibility to be retained at the national level in the listing of 'safe third countries' leads me to abstain on aspects of this report."
"It is clear that we need a fair yet workable approach to the management of asylum, one which is sensitive to the needs of those fleeing political persecution, whilst guarding against possible abuse by others who do not have a legitimate claim."
"I therefore welcome the steps taken by Council towards an integrated approach to asylum policy and look forward to further constructive proposals in this sensitive area."
". In my vote on the Kreissl-Dörfler Report, I would like to express my concerns around the concept of ‘super-safe’ countries, by which the EU States would be allowed to draw up a list of third countries, which are deemed so definitely safe so that refugees' status would be automatically denied."
"It is vital in my view, having practiced asylum law in the past, that we do not erode completely individual assessment for asylum seekers and the Geneva Convention's ‘non-refoulement’ Principal (principal by which governments may not turn refugees away automatically without having their case heard or checking subjective or objective elements to genuine asylum cases)."
". The Kreissl-Dörfler Report, which this House has today adopted by a narrow majority, reflects the EU’s asylum and immigration policy in all its wretchedness."
"By way of a response to the Council’s proposal for a directive, which was characterised by nothing more than the desire to keep refugees out, the report enshrines in law a number of glaring deficiencies."
"It incorporates the concept of the ‘safe country of origin’, so that asylum seekers are denied the right to have their applications examined in the first place."
"As regards the treatment of asylum seekers and ‘illegals’, the text makes no distinction between them, not even in relation to their being dumped in ‘deportation centres’."
"It gives legal standing to the concept of ‘safe third countries’, along with the criteria for them and a list of them, with the consequence that such things as the deportation of refugees from one country after another cannot be prevented."
"I shall be abstaining from voting on it, for, even though the report does institutionalise the denial of rights to refugees, it does at least include a number of improvements to their lot over against the Council document."
"The EU’s political dilemma has not gone away."
"Its ‘Fortress Europe’ policy puts the lives of more and more people at risk, while also depriving people of their rights."
"An EU asylum policy that treated people as having dignity would be rather different."
". The delusion that legislating on this issue is a simple process takes no account of the evidence that different legal systems produce different results, which may prove unpredictable or unwanted."
"Take, for example, the issue of the suspensive effect of appealing against a decision not to grant refugee status."
"This delusion also overlooks the fact that there are different traditions as regards the actual definition of refugee."
"Take the difference between Portugal and the United Kingdom, for example."
"These two aspects were the reason why I voted as I did on the report before us."
"Given that all of the points I felt were key were rejected by the Left in Parliament, I was unable to vote for this report."
"All that remains is for me to express my disappointment that the Left’s obviously good intentions will, as often happens, produce an unwanted outcome."
"A series of moderately flexible rules aimed at making the necessary adaptations to the various national legislations in no way undermines the need to ensure decent, humane hosting of refugees."
"In fact, this is the right way of addressing justified concern over the refugee issue, and demonstrates a desire to find workable solutions."
"Parliament’s changes, which do not force countries to refuse to handle applications from people from ‘safe countries’, which demand shorter processing times and which would require asylum seekers not to be treated as criminals, are along the right lines."
"However, the European Parliament voted against the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance’s proposal totally to abolish the concept of safe countries and instead to follow international human rights rules on giving individual consideration to asylum seekers."
"In all probability, the Council will take no account of the improvements voted for by Parliament. When we vote today on this directive, it will instead be the Council’s proposals, which are inimical to human rights, that we shall in practice be voting on."
"I shall therefore vote against the proposals. Sweden’s Green Party is opposed to a harmonised asylum policy because such a policy is in danger of becoming undemocratic and of precipitating the lowest standards."
"The result would be both a bad bill and Parliament threatening to go to court citing illegal procedures."
"Having had many encounters with refugees from Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Nepal, Russia, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, I appreciate that these poor souls do not come to our continent for fun."
"Each set of parents and every child have their own story to tell – a story of despair and fear."
"This draft directive is disturbing and is the ultimate proof that the Home Affairs and Justice Ministers are playing their own games and refusing to consult with the European Parliament."
"They went against the spirit of the Treaties in concluding what I believe to be an ill-considered political agreement without consulting the European Parliament."
"I therefore endorse Amendment 182, according to which the European Parliament retains the right to bring a case before the Court of Justice in order to verify the proposal’s legitimacy and its reconcilability with the fundamental civil rights."
"I also support all amendments that intend to delete the concept of ‘safe third country’ from the proposal."
"This notion is unacceptable in that it passes the buck from Member States to third countries and will inevitably lead to arbitrariness and political scheming."
"Incidentally, who decides whether a country is (super)safe or not?"
"Is Afghanistan safe after the war?"
"Are Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan – two countries that are creaking under a totalitarian regime – safe countries?"
"Some people in Belgium believe they are."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Kreissl-Dörfler’s report on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status (A6-0222/2005)."
"We are, however, aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark’s position."
"– The sitting is resumed."
"The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have something to add to today’s Minutes, that being the fact that the written statement on rheumatic diseases has, today, already surpassed the two-thirds majority."
"Three hundred and sixty-seven signatures had already been collected, and the figure reached 378 by noon today."
"This written statement, of which I am the joint originator, calls on the Commission and the Council to include rheumatic diseases among the priorities for the EU’s Seventh Framework Programme for Research."
"I ask that this sensational achievement be recorded in today’s minutes."
"– Mrs Stenzel, what you are saying does not pertain to observations on the Minutes of yesterday’s, that is the previous, sitting."
"– The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"- A6-0251/2005 by Mr Guellec, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development [2004/2256(INI)];"
"- A6-0246/2005 by Mr Marques, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions [2004/2253(INI)]."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to spend a few minutes presenting my report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development."
"It is worth pointing out that there have been repeated and insistent calls from a large number of European regions over many years for this concept to be taken into account in EU policies."
"The accession of 10 new Member States, which has manifested itself in a worsening of regional disparities and the emergence of new territorial inequalities, has singularly amplified the calls for this major necessity."
"The draftsmen of the draft Constitution for Europe were well aware of this, since Article 3 of the draft Treaty refers to economic, social and territorial cohesion among the essential objectives of the EU."
"The problematic fate of the Treaty could lead some of those responsible for regional policy, particularly within the European Commission, to show extreme caution against even referring to the necessity for territorial cohesion."
"We do not consider this attitude to be justified and I hope, Commissioner, that you will share our viewpoint."
"Indeed, the tremendous geographical, human and cultural diversity of the territory of the EU, within what is, when all is said and done, a relatively limited area, represents a unique asset on this planet, but, if we are not careful, it contains the seeds for major imbalances that are unbearable for those who view themselves as the victims."
"This was demonstrated beyond all our fears, unfortunately, during the referenda in France and the Netherlands on the draft European Constitution."
"It is probable that popular referenda organised on the same basis would have produced the same result in several other Member States."
"That is why I wanted my report to contribute to finding answers to the questions raised."
"How can we reconcile the citizens to the European project?"
"What is the future for Europe?"
"For our Europe."
"One of the answers is provided by the cohesion policy, this policy of solidarity that is the original model for the EU and that sets it apart from a simple free-trade area."
"Besides ensuring that it has the necessary resources, which assumes that it will be taken properly into account in the financial perspective 2007-2013, it is important for it to integrate the territorial dimension into all its aspects."
"That is how territorial cohesion will come to represent a clear basis that all Europeans can understand for increasing cohesion within the territory of the EU."
"More particularly in relation to the realisation of territorial cohesion, I will mention a few specific principles and measures."
"The principles are as follows: the principle of equality between citizens throughout the territory, which in particular implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest and services of general economic interest; integration of the territorial aspect into the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; multicentric development of the European territory; the role of small and medium-sized towns and their connection with rural areas; strengthening all aspects of territorial cooperation; supported decentralisation to the regions, which are best acquainted with the needs and potential of their territories; multilevel governance, and the participation of non-public partners."
"One of the concrete proposals that we are presenting to the Commission relates to the implementation of three instruments."
"First of all, we are proposing a mechanism for cross-fertilisation between sector-specific policies with a major impact on the development of the EU’s territories and regional development policy."
"Next, new territorial indicators, in addition to gross domestic product, are needed to measure the development of a region and to assess objectively the obstacles to this development."
"Finally, we need a system for assessing the impact that various Community policies have on territorial cohesion."
"Another proposal relates to the drafting of a White Paper on the objective of territorial cohesion and in particular on how this objective is to be incorporated into the national strategic plans that the Member States are currently in the process of drawing up."
"I hope, for my part, that tomorrow’s vote will translate Parliament’s broad support into an ambitious territorial cohesion policy."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today sees the completion of a further stage in the process of conferring special status for the outermost regions, pursuant to Article 299(2) of the Treaties, which is based on the highly specific situation in these regions."
"These regions are characterised by their remoteness, insularity, difficult topography, small size, mountainous nature and economic dependence on one sole product or activity, and the permanence and combination of these factors."
"These are the characteristic features of what are referred to as the outermost regions, and are unique within the EU."
"The fact of the matter is that it would be a grave violation of the principle of proportionality and equality were the outermost regions treated in the same way as the other regions of Europe."
"The model of integration in these outermost regions must take account of their highly specific characteristics and must therefore be subject to adaptation, adjustment and in some cases derogation."
"What is different must be treated differently, and the differences evident in the outermost regions have a very detrimental effect on their economic and social development, resulting in unacceptable competitive disadvantage and an inability to make the most of the benefits triggered by the internal market, the recent enlargement, the Lisbon Strategy and globalisation."
"The fact is that the outermost regions have little chance of competing on a level playing field when the economic activities developed there are burdened by considerable extra cost, arising from, , transport, the absence of economies of scale and external economies, small and fragmented markets and the scarcity of qualified labour. It is therefore of vital importance that we pursue measures aimed at stepping up the EU’s special treatment towards the highly specific characteristics of the outermost regions."
"This is the thrust of the Commission’s communication entitled ‘a stronger partnership for the outermost regions’, on the subject of which I had the honour and the exciting task of drawing up the report before us today."
"The Commission is proposing a far-reaching strategy based on three priorities: competitiveness, accessibility and regional integration."
"This strategy is set to be implemented under the revamped cohesion policy."
"The Commission is also proposing the setting up of innovative instruments, such as the specific programme to compensate for additional costs, along with a wider neighbourhood action plan to aid integration of the outermost regions into the surrounding geographical areas, which will involve both transnational and border cooperation on the one hand and trade and customs measures on the other."
"This is the backbone of the Commission’s proposal to offset and reduce the severity of the main handicaps from which outermost regions suffer."
"The main priority is to address the most serious of these handicaps, namely the remoteness of the outermost regions, which will be done by promoting the use of new information and communications technology, by facilitating transport links to the European mainland and by fostering the integration of the outermost regions in the surrounding areas to which they have always had their backs turned."
"The second big idea is to promote the competitiveness of the outermost regions, which will be achieved not only in terms of the extent to which we reduce the significant extra costs inherent in being an outermost region, but also by means of decisive action on dynamic elements such as competitiveness, education, training, innovation, research, the information society and entrepreneurship."
"On this last point, the Commission’s proposal falls well short and this is its major weak point."
"The problem is that Community policy with a potentially significant effect on the competitiveness of the outermost regions falls well short of what is required."
"This is particularly true of policies designed to boost human capital, technological research and development, the environment, services of general economic interest and telecommunications."
"For that matter, the Commission does not propose any special plans for those regions leaving Objective 1 on account of exceeding the 75% of the Community average in terms of per capita GDP."
"Special phasing out arrangements from Objective 1 to Objective 2 are clearly called for in Article 299(2) of the Treaties."
"The Commission’s proposal is, however, a major step in the right direction, because it is timely, because it correctly establishes its strategy and its priorities and because it proposes innovative policies."
"We welcome the Commission’s initiative, but we urge it to be more ambitious and to take on board the suggestions and comments made in my report."
"I could not finish without a word of thanks to those people whose contributions have enhanced this report."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by making some comments on Mr Guellec's excellent report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development."
"I highly appreciate your support for promoting the concept of territorial cohesion in our regional policy."
"I wish your enthusiasm was shared by all our Member States, but, as you know, the current version of Structural Funds draft regulations has weakened the Commission's proposal on territorial cohesion."
"This is true, for example, for urban issues."
"The proposals foreseen by the Commission as compulsory have been rendered merely optional by the Council."
"Another example is the substantial decrease in terms of financial resources regarding the new European territorial cooperation objective in the Financial Perspective, according to the latest compromise proposal of the Luxembourg Presidency."
"In this proposal it amounts to only half of the amount proposed by the Commission."
"So I should like to encourage you to reinstate our initial ideas in the negotiations."
"I see the work on territorial cohesion as something that we must take forward on two fronts."
"First, through greater emphasis on territorial cohesion in the next generation of cohesion programmes."
"It must be said that in the draft Community strategic guidelines – which were adopted by the Commission at the end of June – we asked Member States and the regions to pay particular attention to a balanced territorial development when preparing their future regional programmes."
"In this context, the future national strategic frameworks represent a key opportunity for promoting development models respectful of territorial balance."
"Moreover, the draft regulations foresee provisions for the specific character of certain territories and they focus on certain thematic priorities which contribute to the territorial development by improving their accessibility or by fostering the development on research and innovation poles."
"Secondly, I believe we can advance our work on territorial cohesion through promotion of exchange of experience, best practice, benchmarking and also analytical work."
"As you know, Espon – the research programme – is helping us to improve the understanding of territorial trends and the impact of sectoral policies on the enlarged Union."
"In addition, other networks, such as Interact or Urbact, contribute to this."
"I feel confident that these initiatives can be continued in the future as well."
"With regard to the regular reports on economic and social cohesion carried out by the Commission, I propose to devote part of the fourth cohesion report – due for publication in 2007 – to the territorial cohesion issue."
"I would also like to inform you that my services are currently preparing a working paper on the cities' contribution to growth and jobs in the regions."
"This paper will complement the Community strategy guidelines and will be presented to the informal ministerial meeting on sustainable communities in Bristol in December of this year."
"Finally, I am also convinced that we can take forward our work on territorial cohesion through better coordination of Community policies and national policies."
"So, once again, I am grateful for the emphasis you put on the role of territorial cohesion in our regional policy and I am willing to take forward the territorial cohesion issue both in the context of the new programmes and in our exchange of best practice."
"I now turn to Mr Marques' report, which is also excellent."
"It is about stronger partnership for the outermost regions, with a number and diversity of recommendations which are clear proof of the strong commitment and dedication of the European Parliament to this important subject."
"I am very pleased that the Commission succeeded in establishing a good foundation for a strong partnership with the outermost regions, at both political and technical levels."
"I strongly believe that the last meeting we had in La Réunion is visible proof of this partnership."
"As you said, we have indeed proposed a significant number of measures to promote economic development of the outermost regions in line with our communication of last year."
"Our proposals cover many areas such as cohesion policy, agriculture, fisheries and research."
"Those proposals are currently under negotiation in the Council and Parliament."
"I sincerely hope that we can swiftly come to an agreement."
"Some important proposals are still under preparation; in particular, rules on national regional aid, which the Commission will adopt by the end of 2005."
"I share your view that much remains to be done."
"Your draft resolution constitutes an important milestone, which we will take into account in our daily work."
"In our next report on the outermost regions, possibly in 2007 or 2008, I plan to assess the progress made."
"It is also indispensable to have a coherent approach across all Community policies that takes account of the specific situation of the outermost regions and which needs to be complemented by appropriate national policies."
"As Commissioner in charge of the coordination of questions related to those regions, I am committed to ensure that all measures taken by the college are adapted to the specific situation of these regions."
"Your motion for a resolution identifies a significant number of topics to which I will refer in my closing remarks."
"With regard to financial perspectives and the cohesion policy and the outermost regions, we certainly welcome the UK Presidency's stated aim of reaching a consensus on the package of regulations as soon as possible so that it can be finalised very quickly once the outcome of the future financing negotiations is known."
"I pay tribute to Parliament, which quickly recognised the urgency of the situation and voted through the regulations at first reading by an overwhelming majority and with very constructive amendments."
"An urgent deal on the budget is particularly important for the outermost regions."
"Such a deal must include, in our view, the special programme that the Commission has proposed for the outermost regions in order to compensate for the additional costs those regions have to bear."
"I repeat that we will do everything we can to get support from the Member States for those ideas."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to focus on the second report. For any policy to be implemented successfully, it needs a good strategy, as we are all aware."
"Yet a good strategy on its own is of little worth without the policy instruments needed for its implementation."
"The Commission deserves praise for the strategy document that it has presented to us."
"What the document reveals is that the repeated expressions of concern and the calls from various Community bodies for stronger partnerships with the outermost regions have been duly taken on board and followed up."
"As regards farming, I was the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture, and was delighted to see the unanimity among its members on the broad issues raised by the document, on sectorial questions and on the specific recommendations and suggestions that I formulated in order to make improvements and plug gaps, with regard to banana, sugar, milk and fruit and vegetable production."
"I welcome the fact that the rapporteur responded positively to all of the crucial questions put forward by the Committee and congratulate him on his outstanding work."
"I also share his concerns as regards the uncertainties concerning the policy instruments required to give the proposed strategy tangible form, such as those instruments designed to solve the current impasse on the financial perspective for the next programming period."
"Without such practical measures, this debate will be little more than a statement of good intentions."
"I want to believe that the Commission and the Council will be consistent with the positions that they have thus far held and I hope that their actions will live up to their responsibilities and the expectations that have been created."
"If so, this will be to the benefit of the social, economic and territorial cohesion of some EU regions suffering from the greatest disadvantages; and if not, the objectives of our Union will not be met."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to applaud Mr Marques for his outstanding report and for taking on board the proposals tabled by the Committee on Fisheries contained therein."
"As draftsman of the opinion of that committee, I should now like to say a few words of interest to the fisheries sector in those regions."
"Although I broadly welcome the content of the Commission’s communication in relation to this sector, I feel that it should have gone a little further."
"I therefore put forward a range of points that I consider essential in the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries."
"There is no doubt in my mind that POSEI-Fisheries should be updated, in keeping with POSEI-Agriculture, on which I was rapporteur, owing to the specific characteristics of the sector and the regions, and the constantly developing situation there."
"I wish to highlight the highly vulnerable nature of the fishing zones there, of which we are all aware, and the social and economic importance of fisheries in some of these regions."
"The truth is that although there is a great deal of water, it is well known there are not many fish in the waters of the outermost regions."
"Added to which is the lack of a continental shelf, meaning that fishing essentially takes place on what are referred to as ‘submarine hills’."
"On this basis, I am of the opinion that the Commission must always apply the precautionary principle where appropriate, unreservedly and without delay."
"We recall, for example, the recent proposal to ban deep-water trawling off the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, a position that we advocated in Parliament."
"Nevertheless, the Commission must give preferential treatment to the outermost regions when it comes to access to maritime resources with a view to safeguarding traditional fishing methods."
"I also feel that the Commission should place limits on fishing methods that may be harmful to ecosystems."
"As for the financial aspect, I should like to remind the Commission of the vulnerable nature of the outermost regions."
"The Commission should therefore maintain, in the European Fisheries Fund, the level of aid currently granted under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance, the level of aid for the processing industry and the derogations that have thus far enabled the outermost regions to modernise their fleet. It should also look to increase compensation levels in respect of the additional costs involved in marketing certain fisheries products."
"Mr President, I wish to comment on Mr Guellec’s report on territorial cohesion and should like to begin by thanking him for the extremely constructive cooperation we have had while the report was being drafted."
"The big difference between now and 15 to 25 years ago is that the regions are very active in their own development."
"They no longer wait for someone else to enable them to develop their economies and societies and create a good life for themselves. They wish to do these things themselves."
"It is not so strange, therefore, that territorial cohesion has become an important concept."
"What it does is sum up this feeling and this desire that exist throughout Europe, including in the city suburbs, that everyone is needed on the continent of Europe, that everyone is important and that all regions have something to contribute."
"This needs to be obvious to all of us in the EU."
"That is why the concept of territorial cohesion, whereby we hold our continent together and everyone feels they are participating, is so important."
"There is a huge amount of knowledge throughout Europe, and that is something we must make the most of if we are to develop our continent."
"If we do not do so, we shall be making a mistake."
"The whole of Europe has an incredible amount of wealth, which is often to be found out in the regions or city suburbs."
"We have a great many natural resources which, when they are turned to good account, are helpful not only to the regions but also to the whole of Europe."
"We are also concerned here with energy, which is what provides us with export income."
"We also have very extensive natural resources that we can use in tourism and for recreation."
"A lot of people are employed in these areas, which are ones that we can develop and that our good for the whole of our continent."
"We also have variety in Europe. We have minorities and immigrants from all around the world whose energy and knowledge must also be made full use of."
"I therefore wish to emphasise a number of points in the report that I think are important."
"The first is that the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies must embrace everyone."
"We must ensure that they extend to include all regions. Otherwise, we shall not be able to develop the whole of Europe."
"The second is that we cannot accept sectoral policy areas, which have the opposite effect of merely strengthening the centre."
"Thirdly, I want to say how important it is for the various policy areas to be valued in Europe so that we obtain genuine territorial cohesion."
"Take the transport area, for example. We must ensure that we have transport routes enabling the whole of Europe to be developed."
"I think that this is a constructive report, and I really do hope that the Commission will listen to what Parliament has to say."
". – Mr President, we simply changed places because Mr Galeote will be along later."
"I should like to start by saying that we have before us two excellent reports, one by Mr Guellec and one by Mr Marques, both of whom I should like to congratulate."
"With regard to the report by Mr Marques, I should like to point out very briefly – because I do not come from one of these regions and my honourable friends from such parts know more about this matter than I do – that the Union needs to give priority to the issues of the outermost regions by honouring the commitments which we all made within the framework of the Treaty on European Union and I am sure that the Commission, insofar as it is able, will proceed in this direction."
"I wish to comment at greater length on the report by Mr Guellec and to say that the Commissioner was indeed right; the draft regulations on the Structural Funds contain many ideas relating to the question of territorial cohesion, an issue which is dealt with in Mr Guellec's report."
"For its part, the European Parliament will indeed do what it can in its negotiations with the Council to ensure that this principle of territorial cohesion is promoted through the regulations on the Structural Funds."
"However, we must not forget that this principle was a principle which was first introduced in a text of the Treaty on European Union within the framework of the adoption of the draft Constitution."
"It was an idea which was jointly promoted by your predecessor, Mr Barnier, and the Committee on Regional Policy of the European Parliament at the time."
"The endeavour was indeed a success, but we have nonetheless, as you know, been unable as yet to get the Constitution ratified."
"I should like to say that the ratification of the Constitution, in relation to the principle of territorial cohesion, will give us many more tools than we presently have at our disposal for proceeding beyond regional policy and seeing territorial cohesion within the framework of competition policy, within the framework of the transport policy of the European Union and so on."
"Consequently, Commissioner, I should like to come back to what was also said yesterday in this Chamber."
"You for your part – the European Commission – and we for our part must take advantage of this period of concentration on the European Constitution in order to enlighten the citizens of the European Union and ensure that this Constitution, which contains positive provisions for the citizens themselves, is adopted as quickly as possible, so that we have more substantial legislative tools in our hands."
"Of course, as long as this period does not turn from a period of concentration into a period of hypnosis."
"That is the huge wager before us and I think that both Parliament and the Commission need to make every possible effort not to waste valuable time and to ensure that the European Union acquires the Constitutional Treaty to which it is entitled and which it deserves."
". Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say to Mr Guellec and Mr Marques, both personally and on behalf of my colleagues in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, that it was a great pleasure to work on their reports, which, of course, are essentially acceptable to us."
"For my part, I would like to focus more particularly on one of the points raised in Mr Guellec’s report, but which also affects Mr Marques’s report, as Mr Guellec has examined the role of urban centres and the surrounding areas."
"For a number of years we have readily been talking – I myself represent a town, Rheims in Champagne – about the concept of catchment areas."
"Catchment areas are zones covering both a town, whether small, medium-sized or large, and all the surrounding rural areas up to 5, 10, 15, 20, or even, to take the French capital, Paris, as an example, up to 200 kilometres outside it, where a number of people travel every day between their homes and their workplaces."
"It was therefore vital, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, for the European Union to fit the bulk of its assistance into the framework of harmonious, consistent territorial development."
"These catchment areas, in particular, must play a central role, which is currently not the case."
"I have mentioned travel; it is clear that, in all catchment areas, there are housing problems."
"Housing is more expensive in the town centre, and cheaper on the outskirts; people choose to live in the outskirts because it is quieter there, or because housing is cheaper."
"All of this results in problems with daily commuting."
"We are seeing depopulated villages just a few kilometres from our towns, while, in some neighbourhoods, there is appalling overcrowding."
"We are experiencing security problems, and I could go on."
"It is therefore perfectly natural that, in order to achieve the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, we need to ensure that there is real cohesion within these catchment areas, between the town centre, the suburbs, the immediate surroundings and the more remote areas."
"Can we overcome these problems without too much difficulty?"
"The answer is obviously no, in view of the large number of players involved."
"These include housing associations, decision-makers in the employment sector, and, of course, political decision-makers operating at local, regional and national level."
"We are all aware of the difficulties involved in harmonising the positions of the various political organisations."
"In this regard, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the European Union currently has a central part to play, in providing a stimulus to create, over the years to come, true cohesion in all of these areas, and harmonious development within these catchment areas."
"Finally, Mr Marques, I have already mentioned the respect I have for your report, and the support that we give it."
"I hope that, in all of our outermost regions, whether in the areas surrounding small towns, larger towns or in any other areas, the EUR 1 100 000 000 that we obviously hope will be released will enable us to realise the harmonious development for which we all hope and pray."
". Mr President, Commissioner, although I propose to devote my remarks primarily to Mr Guellec’s report, Mr Marques can take note of the fact that I regard ‘territorial cohesion’ as applying also to the outermost regions."
"I am much obliged to Mr Guellec for what is a really good report, and I believe that its being an own-initiative report makes it a good means whereby we in this Committee of the European Parliament can develop our own approach."
"Good teamwork has made it possible to produce this balanced but forward-looking report."
"If we all agree that we want – and let me say, Commissioner, that I hope you will succeed in your efforts to get the Member States to join in this – to communicate Europe to people where they are and in their day-to-day lives, then territorial, along with social and economic, cohesion is of enormous importance."
"It will help to secure the acceptance of the principle that all EU citizens should be valued equally and treated fairly irrespective of the region in which they live; it will also help to get this incorporated in all our important documents, for example those relating to the Structural and Cohesion Funds, but also in the implementation of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies."
"We do well to make partnership a primary principle – partnership between cities, their and rural areas, but also partnership between all political levels."
"As I see it, the coherent, harmonious development of all the EU countries, the regions and the cities, largely depends on this, and I want to express my strong support for the idea that a region’s state of development should be assessed by reference to more than just its GDP; other territorial indicators – educational, scientific, cultural and sporting provision, for example, as well as the incidence of unemployment or the state of the infrastructure – need to be included, for viewing the region as a whole gives a much clearer picture of what it is like."
"That is a significant step towards fairer assessment, and will eventually enable the people who live there to have a better understanding of Europe and of the regulations that we enact, and I get the impression that there is still a desperate need for far better communication between us and the citizens of Europe."
". – Article 299(2) of the Treaties states that, taking account of the structural, social and economic situation of the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments, specific measures to support these regions should be adopted."
"These regions are characterised by permanent structural disadvantages which set them apart from the other regions of EU Member States."
"These structural disadvantages are compounded by their remoteness, their insularity, their small size, their difficult topography and climate and by their dependence on a few products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development."
"This is referred to in the Treaties, and for this reason, the specific characteristics of the outermost regions must be mainstreamed across all Community policies, bearing in mind their development needs and the need for effective implementation of economic and social cohesion, a principle that is also enshrined in the Treaties. Furthermore, a specific Community programme to support these regions, bringing together all of the dispersed measures should be set up, which must be granted adequate financial resources within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013."
"This will contribute significantly towards solving the regions’ problems."
"Many of the characteristics and needs of these regions and their populations can and should be addressed."
"Of these, I wish to highlight the need to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks and the activities of fishing communities in these regions. To this end, it is essential that exclusive control of access to their waters, pursuant to the relevant national jurisdiction, should coincide with its exclusive economic zone."
"We must consider implementing a range of permanent support measures in the area of the environment, given that most of the territory of these regions is made up of nature reserves and other protected areas."
"Lastly, we should support measures to support training in traditional handcrafts, local production and tourism."
". Mr President, the British Deputy Prime Minister has been here this week, so it is timely to have a report centred on two of his pet subjects: regionalism and gobbledegook."
"My plain-speaking constituents have no time for regionalism and I doubt if they would be interested in strategic spatial impact evaluation procedures."
"Mr Guellec clearly does not pick up simple messages from ordinary voters."
"His fellow Frenchmen rejected the EU Constitution, yet it is an essential ingredient of his report."
"That is no surprise, for the rapporteur's own website has a whole section devoted to the Constitution, including a table of key dates."
"The most recent key date for Mr Guellec is 29 October 2004, when the Constitutional Treaty was signed in Rome."
"The day of the French referendum, 29 May 2005, is not even a minor detail for him."
"He said that territorial cohesion becomes an essential objective of the EU in the Constitution."
"Sadly for him the Constitution is not an essential objective for French and Dutch voters."
"What is territorial cohesion?"
"The rapporteur can only tell us that the first formal attempt at a definition comes from the Commission."
"Who ever heard of such nonsense: to suggest a project and then attempt a definition?"
"How typical of this mad European Union."
"The rapporteur says that regions are the best qualified level to determine needs."
"He should visit the so-called region that I represent."
"The regional authority in Exeter cannot possibly know what is best for Gloucester, Swindon or Penzance, all many miles away."
"The ordinary people in those areas do not think so."
"Perhaps Mr Guellec is not bothered what those ordinary people think, as long as he can emphasise that his beloved EU Constitution strengthens the role of the regions."
"The only problem for him is that ordinary people in his own country do not agree with his approach."
"He certainly achieves cohesion in one respect, because ordinary people in all parts of the continent will be equally confused by his report, and he is equally out of touch with all of them."
"Mr President, implementation of cohesion policy stems directly from the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Communities."
"It is stated therein that as a Community we shall strive to reduce disparities in the level of development of individual regions and the degree of underdevelopment in less privileged areas."
"This also applies to rural and remote areas."
"It is therefore entirely appropriate for us to consider this very important issue, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"Cohesion policy involves more than implementation of the provisions of a treaty."
"It is about long-term thinking and strategic action."
"It is also an expression of solidarity within the Union."
"Clearly, when considering territorial cohesion we should not adopt a simplistic approach, along the lines that everyone is entitled to everything in equal measure."
"We are all aware that we should be striving to achieve equality between citizens, which is quite another matter."
"The existing differences between Member States and their regions mean that the Union’s cohesion policy must adopt a variety of approaches."
"The policy must be ongoing in nature, and have commonly agreed aims and appropriate limits in terms of time periods and areas covered."
"I would also like to emphasise most strongly that it must have suitable financial resources at its disposal if it is not to be meaningless."
"In this connection, the difficulties experienced in reaching agreement on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective give reason for concern."
"The delays and the real threat of a delay to the Union’s budget could have very serious consequences."
"In my view, it would be advisable to return to sound source material that is politically neutral in nature."
"I have in mind the Europa 2000 Plus study referred to by the rapporteur, though it does of course need updating."
"The priorities set in the strategic guidelines published by the Commission in July are due to be endorsed by Parliament and the Council."
"They should then serve as a basis for genuinely cohesive preparation by the Member States of documents aimed at the future, namely the National Strategic Reference Frameworks."
"In general, I feel that the priorities laid down in the Commission’s document are sensible."
"The urban aspect is worthy of mention."
"Mr Beaupuy referred to it just now, in connection with the role played by metropolitan centres."
"Other important factors are entrepreneurship and the knowledge-based economy."
"I would also like to say that genuine coordination of work related to the various Union documents is essential."
"We need more than lip service to the idea."
"The proposal concerning the relevance of potential accelerated work on the White Paper on territorial cohesion should be considered seriously."
"It does rather seem as if little account has been taken of the actual situation in the new Member States in the work undertaken to date."
"According to the latest figures published concerning Union expenditure over the last year, two countries of the old Fifteen, namely Greece and Portugal, head the list of net beneficiaries with reference to GDP."
"The new countries lag far behind."
"I should add that in term of absolute sums Spain comes top."
"It is not my intention to criticise anyone in any way whatsoever, but simply to dispel the myth that enormous amounts of money are being handed out to the new Member States."
"Mr President, the Union cannot look to the future with optimism if it lacks a properly run cohesion policy."
"I would remind the House that there can be no European cohesion without European solidarity."
"Mr President, the Guellec report does not impress me, for three reasons."
"First of all, the EU has no power in the field of spatial planning, yet it presumes to chart a course for this on the back of the dead Constitution."
"That is wrong and it shows utter contempt for the electors of Europe, not least the electors of Mr Guellec's own country, who handsomely rejected the Constitution."
"Secondly, territorial cohesion is clearly being advanced for the political objective of bypassing and downgrading the entity of the nation–state."
"It aims for territorial integration."
"There are obvious political and constitutional issues here, which are perhaps more obvious to me, given where I come from, than to some others."
"I do not want my part of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, treated instead as part of the territorial whole of the island of Ireland."
"That would offend and it would defy the settled political will of Northern Ireland's people."
"The EU must act within the constraints and parameters of that reality."
"Thirdly, within the context of cohesion funding, talk of territorial cohesion in my region is somewhat ironic, since we were excluded from cohesion funding from its inception, while our neighbour in the Irish Republic was included."
"The real route to cohesion was equality of access to funding, but that was denied to Northern Ireland, while the south of Ireland benefited to the tune of over EUR 2 billion for its infrastructure."
"Thus, it is so much nonsense to now talk grandly about securing equality of treatment between territories."
"The EU had its chance to give such equality of funding to Northern Ireland for necessary infrastructure but it failed, by making national statistics instead of regional need the threshold for access."
"Mr President, unless I am misinformed, I have had Mr Galeote’s three minutes added to my speaking time, but I shall defer to the services’ judgment on that; in any case, I do not need all three of them, but I would be glad to lay claim to some of them."
"I, of course, take a completely different view of Mr Guellec’s splendid own-initiative report from that of Mr Allister, who spoke before me, for Mr Guellec is right to emphasise territorial cohesion as one of the EU’s strategic goals in terms of the promotion of harmonious and balanced development throughout its territory."
"It is in this respect, as he also rightly points out, that the EU marks itself out as something more than just a free trade zone, and quite right too."
"The eastward enlargement brought a new and significant dimension to the challenge of cohesion, as the EU had never before had to face such a marked increase in disparities."
"It is true to say that the new, enlarged EU is now characterised by a great deal of geographical and cultural diversity, and this is what distinguishes it from comparable major economic areas such as the USA, Japan or Mercosur."
"As such diversity does, however, constitute one of the EU’s great growth factors, it needs to be maintained as European integration proceeds."
"This means that the policies that affect the EU’s spatial and urban structure must promote its territorial continuity, without – let me emphasise – standardising local and regional identities, as these have a vital role to play in enriching the quality of life for the public as a whole."
"If I may express this in more precise terms, the territory that now comes into being does not abolish national, regional or local areas."
"On the contrary, the object of spatial planning at European level is to make the best possible use of every specificity as a source of growth."
"The rapporteur is right to say that the EU does not as yet possess any competence for spatial planning, for no provision is made for it in the treaties, even though it is a thorny issue for the Member States."
"I am persuaded that the reduction in the number of goals for the coming planning period will make the new regional cohesion policy more coherent."
"The new regional cohesion policy, with fewer targets to meet in the next planning period, must – and will – gain new dynamism in facing up to the challenges that await it, so that the objective of territorial cohesion, too, will be achieved, and, indeed, if need be, independently of the budget funding provided for regional and cohesion policy, which we still hope will be substantial enough to enable us to perform the tasks set us."
"With this end in mind, we must, on the one hand, focus on the Community’s strategic guidelines for cohesion, while also taking territorial specificities into account, and, while I am on that subject, I have to say that I take a rather sceptical view of the rapporteur’s proposals, according to which, alongside GDP, new territorial criteria and indicators need to be created in order to evaluate a region’s development and the obstacles to it."
"We have learned from previous planning periods that this is where we face the great risk of such additional criteria, when brought into play by one or other party, all too easily degenerating into a wish list that can no longer be objectively evaluated."
"It is indeed the case that economic, social and territorial cohesion make interconnection not only between the regional, state and European levels, but also between the Community’s various policy areas necessary."
"It is the regions, however, that will in future remain the appropriate territorial level for the implementation of cohesion policy, in line with the principles of subsidiarity and decentralisation."
"It is with this in mind that both Parliament and the Commission have – and rightly – favoured explicit decentralisation and concentration along the lines of ‘one fund, one programme’, and so I am led to take what is actually an optimistic view of the next planning period."
"– Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating my friend, Mr Marques, on his excellent report and to thank him for being amenable to incorporating contributions made by other Members of this House."
"I should also like to congratulate Mr Guellec on the quality of his report."
"As shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Development, I tabled a number of amendments, most of which were adopted, and proposed that my political group support the report and most of the amendments tabled in the vote, both in committee and now in plenary."
"Despite our different perspectives and approaches, we came together in support of, firstly, the strategy proposed by the Commission for the sustainable development of the EU’s outermost regions, as regards the priorities, the instruments and, most importantly, the setting up of a specific programme to offset the additional costs relating to the specific, permanent constraints suffered by the outermost regions, such as remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few products and activities and the limited scope of local markets, and, secondly, the establishment of an action plan for the wider neighbourhood."
"Although we were in favour of the strategy, we offered a number of criticisms or reservations, relating to the following areas: firstly, the absence of measures and financial resources to follow up the Commission’s statements and proposals; secondly, the use of per capita GDP as the sole criteria for these regions to qualify for the new ‘Convergence’ objective of the revamped cohesion policy; thirdly, the use of population criteria for the distribution of budgetary appropriations set out for the specific programme to compensate for additional costs; and fourthly, uncertainty over the action plan for the wider neighbourhood, given that it is unclear how this will fit in to the future ‘European territorial cooperation’ objective of the revamped cohesion policy and of the relevant ‘New Neighbourhood Policy’."
"Consequently, in line with the view expressed by the rapporteur, I would suggest that the outermost regions deserve to be treated as a special case in view of their specific constraints, under Article 299(2), regarding the conditions for access to the Structural Funds, whereby priority financial support should be given to them, irrespective of their income level."
"I would also advocate an increase in budgetary appropriations relating to the specific programme to be redistributed fairly on the basis of the constraints affecting them. Furthermore, the action plan for a wider neighbourhood should be clarified within the framework of the future ‘European territorial cooperation’ objective and the Union’s new ‘Neighbourhood Policy’."
"The concept of neighbourhood should encompass both neighbouring regions and countries such as Morocco, Cape Verde and Brazil, and countries hosting large communities of immigrants from the outermost regions that retain strong traditional ties."
"I therefore support the adoption of this report, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as it represents a further step in the right direction in response to the Commission’s welcome proposal."
"In this way, once the financial perspective has been adopted, the conditions will be in place for the sustainable development of the outermost regions, and the successful promotion of economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my sincere appreciation of both Mr Guellec’s and Mr Marques’s reports; I shall focus particularly on Mr Guellec’s."
"One of the European Union’s basic aims concerns cohesion policy, especially since the latest enlargement and in view of the imminent future accession of Bulgaria and Romania."
"The European Parliament has distinguished itself precisely on cohesion policy during this first part of the parliamentary term, since it has approved all the regulations on regional policy for the 2007-2013 programming period."
"On the other hand, the constant, fruitful cooperation and dialogue with Commissioner Hübner, which I have personally experienced as rapporteur on the Cohesion Fund regulation, has led to a firm resolve on the part of the Commission and Parliament not to accept reductionist solutions."
"A credible and effective cohesion policy cannot, indeed, exist without adequate financial instruments, and that is why we are hoping for a prompt decision on the financial perspective."
"It is necessary to avoid having European aid concentrated in just a few areas, thus adding to the existing disparities within a single region."
"Instead, measures must be adopted that are widespread, harmonious and thorough in less-developed areas, as Mr Guellec has rightly shown."
"I also agree with the rapporteur on the importance of towns, especially small to medium-sized ones, as motors for territorial cohesion."
"That is the point I tried to make by tabling amendments, which Parliament then adopted, to the regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, for which I was shadow rapporteur on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"The amendments also emphasised the pivotal role of the urban dimension in developing the immediately adjacent rural fringes."
"I also welcome Mr Guellec’s proposal of using specific territorial indicators alongside the usual parameter of GDP for measuring a region’s development."
"I also believe that they should be used periodically to provide impact assessments on ongoing Community programmes."
"Among all the positive effects that such working methods would bring about, I would mention the further transfer of responsibilities to local authorities and actors, who must increasingly be seen as leading players and promoters of development, and greater flexibility at the implementation stage of measures, leading to a more appreciable effect on the territories."
"– Mr President, I am delighted that we have the opportunity today to debate and vote on two important reports on the regional policy of the Union."
"I should like, if I may, to focus my attention on the report by Mr Guellec on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development."
"My colleague's report has, in my opinion, one very important paragraph: I refer to paragraph 3, which states that Parliament calls for 'regional development to be founded on programmes which guarantee equality of treatment between the EU's territories, while preserving their diversity, which notably implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest and services of general economic interest'."
"What services of general interest are we talking about today?"
"The services which the European Commission insists on liberalising?"
"How will these services continue to be services of general interest and how will they help territorial cohesion?"
"To give you a spectacular example, I am sure that you know that Greece, on the basis of Community legislation, will shortly be privatising its national airline."
"I wonder to what degree this will help territorial cohesion, knowing the peculiarities of the Greek state."
"How can a private individual replace the state as a general interest service provider?"
"Obviously, we are proceeding with a firm step, in this instance, towards both the decline of the citizens in outermost areas who expect a service of general interest, and of the workers who risk finding themselves unemployed in the Community of the future."
"We are also discussing territorial cohesion here at a time when, in Brussels, the governments of the Member States can hardly even agree on the financial perspectives, with the result that the Member States will be in for a few surprises."
"So let us not bury our head in the sand."
"Territorial cohesion is desirable but on the right bases, bases which relate to social opinion, not on the basis of market pressures."
"Mr President, one of the European Community’s strategic aims often referred to by advocates of integration is to reduce the disparities in the level of development of the regions of Europe."
"Citizens of the new Member States placed great importance on this and still do."
"Along with economic and social cohesion, territorial cohesion has an important part to play in achieving that aim."
"In view of the differences in development across the 25 Member States that will soon become 27, actions concerning transport, tourism, environmental protection, research and innovation are particularly important."
"Territorial balance can be ensured by strengthening the ranks of small and medium-sized urban centres."
"In these areas, urban planning should provide for the development of housing stock, transport networks and the regeneration of land previously put to industrial use."
"This approach will allow the periphery and surrounding rural areas to benefit from the economic growth of the centres too."
"At present, dynamic economic and urban growth is only taking place within the largest urban centres, namely the metropolitan areas."
"Unfortunately, the developmental needs of smaller urban units are being disregarded, so the growth is accentuating inequalities instead of reducing them."
"Satisfactory territorial development in all Member States of the Union can only be achieved through the implementation of a decentralised model of spatial development."
"One key feature of such a model is that it is based on a network of towns with different economic, social and cultural potential."
"Another important feature is the establishment of permanent links with rural areas."
"The Lubelski region I come from is one of the largest in Poland."
"It accounts for 8% of the territory of my country and 5% of its population."
"There are 40 mainly small and medium-sized towns in this region, the largest being Lublin, the regional capital."
"The latter has a population of approximately 400 000 inhabitants, and the population of the other town varies between 20 000 and 70 000 inhabitants."
"Over half the population of the region lives in rural areas."
"If the unsatisfactory level of infrastructure is taken into account also, the Lubelski region could serve as an example of the practical implementation of territorial cohesion in a decentralised manner."
"One can but hope that the activities of the Union’s decision-makers will result in more than mere fine words and intentions, as was the case in the past."
"Specific measures are needed, and provision should be made in the Union’s budget for the next few years, and also in the long-term Financial Perspective."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Commission for the good work it has done, for defining the special nature of the outermost regions better, and for meeting the needs of those areas, which suffer particularly from their geographical location in terms of development and market competitiveness."
"It is good that increasingly effective measures in support of those regions are being assessed and that a wider neighbourhood action plan is also foreseen in the Marques report, to encourage trade between those regions and their adjacent markets."
"The wider neighbourhood action plan is a good opportunity both to establish economic, social and cultural links with those countries that host emigrant communities from the outermost regions and to bring down the barriers that limit trading opportunities with the surrounding geographical areas, such as the West Indies, the Americas and Africa."
"In its communication COM(2004)0343 of 26 May 2004, the Commission set itself two goals: to reduce the difficulties of access to the outermost regions, not just in relation to continental Europe but also from one region to another, and to improve the competitiveness of businesses."
"This is the goal we must achieve: help them to grow so we can all grow."
"That, if you like, is also the meaning of the Lisbon Strategy."
"In the present context, however, efforts must first be directed towards having some certainty on the financial perspective, because only then will we be able to judge whether the funds available to the regions will allow for the fair distribution of resources in line with the requirements that the Commission has outlined."
"In conclusion, then, I welcome a greater commitment to the outermost regions and a stronger partnership for these regions, so as to enable them to escape from isolation and to make them increasingly competitive on the common market."
"Mr President, I know I have one minute, and you would not let me go over it, would you?"
"You just conspire against me, as the previous President did, to engage in some kind of institutional bullying."
"But we shall leave that to one side."
"I am glad of the opportunity to place on record the deep resentment of my constituents in the East Midlands at the attempts by Brussels – aided, let it be said, by a supine British Government – to divide England by imposing artificial regions."
"It will divide the English nation and undermine our nationality."
"Well, I have news for you: it will not work because the people in, for example, Derby, in the East Midlands, have no special affinity with the people of Lincolnshire."
"The regions are artificial."
"They are spurious."
"They have no identity."
"They will not work either because the English people do not want them."
"They voted against in the north-east by 90% in the one opportunity they had, and they will do so elsewhere."
"We English are very tolerant."
"We are prepared to subsidise the Welsh, the Scots and most of the nations here."
"We do it with resignation."
"We will not tolerate being robbed of our nationality and our identity."
"So carry on with your policy."
"Carry on trying to divide us, because what you will do is inflame the English and English nationalism and we will assert ourselves and we will insist on governing ourselves again."
"Thank you, Mr Kilroy-Silk."
"The speaking time allotted to you is nothing personal."
"It is not my will, nor my responsibility."
"I am just reading the list in front of me, as you very well know."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mr Guellec and Mr Marques on their excellent reports."
"As I come from one of the outermost regions, I will concentrate on Mr Marques’s report, which focuses on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions, because it makes it possible, thanks to some in-depth work, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the European Union’s activities in those regions."
"I give my full support to the rapporteur, who, while noting that the most recent proposals drafted by the Commission in favour of the outermost regions are promising, nevertheless calls on it to be more active in exercising the right of initiative accorded to it under the Treaties, with regard to the cohesion policy, of course, but also to other Community policies and more generally to areas important for the development of the outermost regions."
"It seems to me to be essential to point out once again, at a time when everyone is preoccupied with the financial perspective and the reform of EU regional policy for the period 2007-2013, that the great majority of the derogations implemented or proposed for the outermost regions can in no way damage competition or the fundamental principles of Community law."
"With regard to the programme to compensate for the additional costs incurred by the outermost regions, the Commission has quite rightly proposed to provide it with EUR 1 100 000 000."
"However, echoing one of my amendments, which was adopted in the Committee for regional development, I would stress that these funds should be devoted solely to the outermost regions and that their allocation should not penalise any of those regions."
"With reference to another of my amendments that was adopted in committee, I hope that the wider neighbourhood action plan will have a specific budget aimed at transnational and cross-border cooperation and that the much hoped-for coordination between the assistance funded by the ERDF for the outermost regions and the assistance provided by the EDF for their ACP and OCT neighbours will finally come into effect, with or without the inclusion of the EDF in the budget."
"In conclusion, I think this is an opportune moment to state, with modesty, but without an inferiority complex, my conviction that the outermost regions of the EU are just as important as its centre."
"I sincerely hope that this vision is shared by all the Member States, old, new and future."
"Indeed, in an increasingly globalised world, there is no benefit for the enlarged Europe in doing without its outposts in the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean, Latin America or the Indian Ocean."
"That is the position that Parliament has always defended and will, no doubt, continue to defend."
"Have no doubt that the overseas populations will be particularly grateful to you for this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, while I welcome Mr Marques’s work, I would like to comment more specifically on the report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Guellec on his excellent work and the pertinence of his comments on the concept of ‘territorial cohesion’, which seems to me to be at the heart of Community regional policy, which is now referred to more and more frequently as cohesion policy."
"The Constitutional Treaty makes territorial cohesion an objective of the European Union, in the same way as social cohesion and economic cohesion."
"Thus, even though the ratification process experienced some difficulties, as we know, this constitutes official recognition of the relevance, currency and importance of the territorial aspects of regional and cohesion policy."
"The latest enlargement also confirms the urgent nature of this."
"In my opinion, regional policy primarily aims to reduce development disparities at local and regional level and thus constitutes an indispensable counterbalance to convergence and economic competitiveness policy."
"However, cohesion does not stand in opposition to convergence and competitiveness: these concepts must be and remain complementary."
"While ensuring that the development of Europe’s most dynamic regions is not hindered, so that they can play their part as the engine of the European economy, the main aim of the cohesion policy is to help the most disadvantaged and underdeveloped regions."
"The reformed regional and cohesion policy must also be integrated in the Lisbon Strategy but, above all, ensure solidarity and equality between areas and the visible continuity of the efforts previously agreed to in the old Member States."
"Therefore, to achieve harmonious and sustainable development of the European territory, we must attack territorial imbalances."
"We must take into consideration the diversity of the European area and the often cumulative handicaps of certain areas, be they natural, historical or demographic, such as low population density or imbalances in the age pyramid or in the active population."
"We must measure the additional costs faced by these regions and help them so that these areas have the same development opportunities as others and so that the people who live there are not penalised."
"Of course, that requires resources and I hope that the financial perspective will soon reach a favourable outcome, so as to give the regional policy an adequate budget and to help the areas that still need it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Marques’s report once again bears witness to the attention that the European Parliament pays to the outermost regions."
"Indeed, the Ligios report on the French overseas departments, back in the second parliamentary term, laid the initial foundations for the concept of the outermost regions, a report that inspired programmes already intended to compensate for remoteness and insularity."
"During the current period of uncertainty about what will happen after 2006, Parliament’s support for the outermost regions is very valuable."
"Sérgio Marques’s report is very much to the point in this regard."
"Indeed, although the European Union’s support has made possible a number of achievements in our underdeveloped regions, there is still much to be done."
"That was also the conclusion of the 11th Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions, which took place on the island of Réunion at the beginning of this month, in your presence, Mrs Hübner."
"On that occasion, I advocated a reversal of approach to relations between the European Union and the outermost regions."
"Over and above what the European Union brings to these regions, we must recognise the worth of what they bring in terms of European added value."
"Let me remind you of some obvious examples."
"It is the outermost regions that put Community shipping in its position as world leader."
"The geographic situation of Kourou in Guiana makes a significant contribution to the competitiveness differential enjoyed by the European space industry."
"So, there is the ocean, space, and we could also cite the exceptional biodiversity of the outermost regions, their importance for improving knowledge of climatic phenomena and their contribution to cultural diversity."
"The great distance from the continent in which the outermost regions are integrated and the geographic proximity of other continents with which the European Union has agreements also sometimes give rise to contradictions."
"I would like to conclude, Mr President, by saying that this dual identity provides a real prospect for the sustainable codevelopment of these areas, all of which face major challenges."
"The EU’s ability to respond to the question of the development of its outermost regions will bear witness to its ability truly to be a decisive player in fair and controlled globalisation."
"Mr President, this debate is particularly important for the new Member States of the Union and especially for my country, Poland."
"To put it bluntly, any changes in the policy on providing equality of opportunity for poorer Member States must not have a negative impact on the new Member States."
"If the Union is to demonstrate solidarity and unity in practice, it must respond to the aspirations of its new members on the basis of existing principles."
"At the same time, this policy must take greater account of the needs of small and medium-sized towns and regions than has been the case in the past."
"To date, the tendency has been for metropolitan areas to receive the lion’s share of Union funds and resources."
"There is some justification for this, but it has meant neglecting smaller local government structures at a lower level, even though they were in even greater need of support."
"I fear that the proposed changes we have been hearing about this last year are aimed exclusively at extending the flow of funding to the poorer countries of the old Union."
"We have nothing against that, but at the same time we would like it to be possible to make use of all the existing opportunities and support for the new Member States."
"I have every confidence that the Commissioner will be the guardian of a Europe of equal opportunities within the Commission."
"I can assure her that she can always count on our support on these issues."
"Mr President, the European Union has been pursuing its policy of social and economic cohesion for the last 30 years, with notable cohesion not meaning putting the brake on the development of the most powerful and dynamic of the regions of Europe."
"On the contrary, it means increasing the potential for development of the weakest and enhancing their opportunities in terms of competitiveness."
"The European Union is called on to react creatively to recent and future enlargements."
"For example, cohesion policy must be adjusted appropriately in response to new conditions and challenges."
"Conditions in the enlarged European Union are different."
"Consequently, existing actions aimed at social and economic cohesion need to be expanded, and become horizontal."
"More emphasis should be placed on the need to reduce the differences emerging between centres and the hinterland, between metropolitan areas and small and medium-sized towns, and between towns and rural areas."
"The new conditions also make it necessary for local authorities to be much more involved in efforts to do away with the disparities between all the social groups mentioned."
"The democratic deficit will not be reduced without the active participation of representatives of regional and local communities in the implementation of Community programmes."
"I would remind the House that in January 2003 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the role of local and regional authorities in the European Union."
"It was laid down in this resolution that not only should local and regional authorities be more involved with the implementation of Union policies, but that they should also contribute to the drafting of such policies."
"Extending cohesion policy to include territorial cohesion confirms that cohesion policy as implemented across the length and breadth of the Union is one of the European Union’s key policies."
"I should like to add that I believe Community provisions should place more emphasis on partnership."
"I have in mind partnership between authorities at different levels and also joint activities increasing effective use of European financial instruments."
"Mr President, the European Parliament showed its desire to give special assistance to remote and peripheral regions when it voted in July on a major package of cohesion policy measures."
"However, in July, the Committee on Regional Development adopted the own-initiative report drawn up by Mr Sérgio Marques, in response to two Commission papers on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions."
"The report called for support for the outermost regions and for areas that are important to their development: agriculture, fisheries, competition and state aids, enterprise policies, services of general interest and services of general economic interest, taxation, customs measures, environment, energy, research, technological development, vocational training, transport, trans-European networks, new information and communication technologies."
"It is to public transport that I would like to turn."
"Public transport is important to all our local communities, and in Scotland ferries provide an essential service for some of the European Union's most peripheral and vulnerable communities."
"Tomorrow I will be welcoming to the European Parliament a delegation from the CalMac trade unions, who will be meeting the transport Commissioner."
"As I said yesterday, presently these ferry services are being put out to tender in communities where they are the sole mode of transport connecting island communities to the mainland."
"Under the latest Commission proposals for land transport public service obligations, public administrations will be given flexibility over tendering processes and will be able to award certain services to in-house operators directly."
"Why are lifeline ferries being treated differently from trains, trams and metros?"
"There are no trains, trams and metros in Scotland's peripheral, island communities."
"Given the Commission's general position on the needs of the outermost regions, its position here would appear to be contradictory."
"I urge the Commission to clarify its position."
"Lifeline ferry services are too important to be ignored."
"Mr President, that the outermost regions need our support is self-evident."
"The Marques report offers many good proposals for strengthening the infrastructure of, for example, isolated islands or mountainous regions."
"Structural policy of this sort is yet another expression of European solidarity and equality of opportunity."
"What I particularly like about this report is the balance that it has acquired now that the unreasonable demands are gone from it."
"What makes the rapporteur’s concept credible is that it takes Parliament’s existing structural policy conception as its foundation."
"Its consistency and the reasonable demands for the coming period notwithstanding, I do see danger ahead in the likelihood that, in future, far less money will be available for structural policy, and this leads me to believe that structural policy on the present models will, in a few years’ time, be obsolete, and we will need to look for new ideas as to how, with less money, to carry on supporting Europe’s regions – whether that means a policy of subsidised loans, of guarantees, or one with a greater emphasis on key infrastructures and core projects."
"In future, we will have to give more attention to the question of how and where subsidised investment actually does attract more investment, and whether our use of investment subsidies in isolated areas might not in fact result in an ever-increasing need for support."
"Our eventual goal must be a policy with an overall greater emphasis on Europe’s ability to compete."
"Much as I welcome the Marques Report as a first step towards a realistic outlook, we need to move even further away from indiscriminate ongoing subsidies and towards economic growth that maintains its own momentum."
"If we are to do that, the EU needs more encouragement to move in that direction, not least from those who make regional policy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU is not only a political project; it is also a project that is synonymous with solidarity and should be based on economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"As an area that cuts across all areas, territorial cohesion should be mainstreamed in all EU policies, so that we do not fall into the trap of exacerbating the differences between the existing 25 Member States and those that are on their way, whom I should like to take this opportunity to greet."
"We must break down some of the barriers faced by the outermost regions and invest in a sustainable development model that takes account of the disparities between not only Member States but also regions, even within the same Member State."
"The purpose is therefore to give tangible form to the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, without making the mistake of achieving efficiency and competitiveness by promoting an unequal Europe."
"It is essential that we do not use per capita GDP as the sole eligibility criteria for the Structural Funds, which is after all the classic indicator. Other indicators must be used, as a matter of priority, such as the amount of activity in research and innovation, the level of education and training, the extent of diversification of productivity in the area and the unemployment rate."
"Subjecting a region’s actual needs to an indicator that is often determined at national level is notoriously error-prone."
"I should like to draw your attention, Mr President, Commissioner, to the issue of phasing out in certain regions, 19 of them in all, which since enlargement have acquired the status of being statistically wealthier, whilst their actual economic situation has seen no improvement."
"This is a serious problem affecting regions such as the Algarve, in Portugal, from where I hail, one of the outermost regions in terms of the European mainland, which also suffers from deep internal disparities, quite apart from the fact that it is surrounded on all sides by Objective 1 areas."
"For this region, just as for all of the other 18, a balanced solution must be found whereby they remain eligible while structural problems are still apparent, and they are helped to achieve more balanced development."
"The Union needs to find a response to the challenges that enlargement has placed before us."
"That response must be characterised by solidarity and responsibility and requires territorial cohesion and the political courage to create the conditions whereby the EU can become a prosperous area, without discrepancies between north and south, east and west, between mountainous areas and outermost regions."
"– Mr President, I wish to refer to the report by Mr Marques, whom I warmly congratulate on the work he has done."
"I refer to the particularly remote island areas which we also have a duty to support and not to abandon."
"To exaggerate somewhat, and this goes slightly beyond the boundaries of the issue, I would say that we have a duty to support every resident of the European Union living in difficult areas under difficult living conditions."
"In my country, in Greece, many people live in island areas, which may not be particularly remote but where living conditions are difficult and the people there often remain totally cut off for fairly long periods of time, especially in winter."
"The European Union is the country of solidarity."
"All its citizens have the right to education for their children, job security, a healthy life, healthcare, recreation and everything that urban residents can enjoy."
"If we abandon the people in remote regions and they are forced to leave their villages, no one else will ever go to live there, resulting in ecological deterioration, devastation and destruction."
"These people are doing us a favour by living there."
"We need to give them solace. ."
"The region is the foundation of Europe."
"If we start to abandon these people to their fate without a second thought, then the destruction of the European Union will come about."
"They are doing us a favour by living there under these difficult conditions and we must return the favour."
"Mr President, territorial cohesion is a strategic aim of the European Union, and one of the most important of these, as it promotes harmonious and unified development."
"Nonetheless, it remains a dream."
"In particular, following the recent accession of 10 much poorer countries, the disparity between the development of individual regions has become even more marked."
"For example, if the British Inner London region boasting 270% of average GDP for the Union is compared with the Lubelski district in Poland whose GDP is barely 30% of average for the Union, one can appreciate how much still remains to be done."
"The European Union needs a Community strategy for cohesion, and the territorial aspect should be taken into account when implementing all Community policies."
"All aspects of territorial cooperation should be strengthened."
"I refer to cooperation at cross-border level and also at inter-regional and supra-national levels."
"Stronger cooperation and partnership between urban centres, their periphery and rural areas is also needed."
"In a European Union founded on solidarity, regional development must be based on programmes that ensure equal treatment for all regions."
"In practice, this means that the citizens should have appropriate access to public services and to services provided in the general economic interest."
"The House is well aware that we are nowhere near attaining that objective."
"Consequently, the failure to agree on a new budget for the Union and the lack of a new Financial Perspective are particularly worrying."
"Actions aimed at achieving territorial cohesion across the Union must be improved, and Parliament must become more involved in monitoring progress towards genuine territorial cohesion."
"If this does not happen, disparities in the development of individual regions are bound to increase."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you to help create a cohesive Europe founded on solidarity."
"I am sure none of us would advocate a Europe in which we were subdivided into the rich and the poor."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I share the positive assessment of the two reports that we are examining, which reveal the considerable differences that exist among our regions and show how these differences have become even greater with enlargement."
"Territorial cohesion is the basis for lasting social and economic cohesion."
"If we want to aim at having an area of growth, well-being, stability and justice that embraces all the 500 million inhabitants that make up the European Union today, it has to be a primary objective. If it is so difficult, however, to make more slowly developing regions progress, what will happen when events that are completely out of the ordinary strike one of these regions, events that may result from climatic factors, fires, floods or earthquakes?"
"We have seen on our television screens what has happened on the other side of the Atlantic in highly developed areas like Louisiana or Texas. On our own doorstep we have the situation of the regions in Romania where the flooding of recent weeks has led to death and despair."
"If the European Union is not there when it is needed – because in actual fact, apart from a Solidarity Fund that hardly has any money available at all, we do nothing – if Europe is not there in those cases, when does it expect to be there?"
"What can a Europe that has not yet reached agreement on the financial perspective, a Europe in which six governments of large countries are calling for further reductions in their financial commitments, promise to those countries and those peoples who have believed in the European dream?"
"Well, I think we need to reflect on that, because that is what our fellow citizens are expecting and that is what we are duty-bound to do for our future and for that of our children."
"Mr President, one of the most efficient ways of implementing community policies is to strengthen the cohesion between regions with different levels of development."
"This is something we must do to achieve the most important objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, such as increased competitiveness, more jobs, a strengthening of social cohesion, togetherness and solidarity as well as securing sustainable development."
"Cooperation and cohesion between regions contribute to stronger integration; they create the foundation of sustainable development in each region and facilitate the universal use of best practices."
"They enable the regions to cooperate in various ways within the framework of regional cooperation across borders, between states or larger geographical entities."
"Exploiting heterogeneity and the national, regional or local opportunities may increase our workload, but if we consider the task on a European scale, it promises more substantial results and larger benefits, and it is definitely worth the effort."
"The government must also take part in the national, regional and local cooperation."
"Dialogue, the exchange of opinions and a lively relationship between the three levels of nation, community and region are essential prerequisites to cooperation, as are the public and private sectors."
"Development strategies are built on good partnerships that involve consultation, active participation by all partners, combined efforts with the relevant authorities, social partners and the organisations of the civil society including non-governmental organisations."
"Regional cohesion implies equal treatment of the various European regions, while not losing sight of their individual geographic and demographic characteristics."
"Its fundamental objective is to raise the standard of living which in turn is a precursor to the equal treatment of citizens."
"The economic and social convergence of the regions helps the cause of gender equality in all areas and at all levels."
"To get there, we have to initiate dedicated programmes and fight all forms of discrimination."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank both rapporteurs, Mr Marques and Mr Guellec."
"As Commissioner Hübner has already said, territorial cohesion is under pressure, and she was actually asking for this Parliament’s support."
"There is every reason to repeat this request in this House, for when we study last week’s OECD report on the regional differences, we see that 40% of growth is realised in less than 10% of the regions."
"We know that competition on a world scale requires that a distinction be drawn between regions, top regions and regions of excellence, which are mentioned in the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development."
"Although that may be the case, knowledge is one thing, but innovation in the regions, production and marketing are quite something else."
"In short, specialisation within the regions is necessary."
"There is nothing wrong with it, but the strategic actions plans requested by Parliament and the Commission that are in line with the Lisbon objective are tailored to national scale."
"It is now important in this Parliament to highlight once again, and safeguard, the territorial, or regional, dimension, certainly now, with a view to the future, that the new objective 2 funds and the resource and development funds will be combined, or will, at least be deployed together."
"That is why I support Mr Guellec’s idea of reviewing the regional contribution in 2007 in the form of a White Paper or otherwise. What will then be the state of play as regards this multi-level approach, or this decentralised focus, for that matter?"
"On a final note, there are, fortunately, regions developing that often take on cross-border tasks in a new context."
"In my region, I have seen Eindhoven, Louvain and Aachen, located in three countries, do exactly that."
"So, although territorial dimension and cohesion are important, they are also being restyled."
"In that way, we have to help think ahead in respect of these opportunities that are vital across the European Union."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is an undisputed fact that, without economic, social and territorial cohesion between the regions of the Union, we shall be unable to meet the internal and external challenges which we face."
"How successful can our fight for a competitive and social Europe with quality of life for all its residents be if structural inequalities between its regions continue to remain acute and territorial peculiarities continue to constitute a factor of delay and exclusion for numerous European areas?"
"In the enlarged European Union, with the rapid increase in regional inequalities and acute intra-regional inequalities, we need a dynamic and effective regional policy, which not only must reach the poorest regions of the Union, but also must help to bring about a balanced relationship and integrated development between urban and rural areas in each region, while at the same time strengthen inter-regional cooperation."
"The budget which will be allocated in order to apply regional policy and cohesion policy must respond to the risks which are now visible."
"The role and importance of territorial cohesion must not, under any circumstances, be downgraded."
"In the new programming period, it is of fundamental importance that sectoral policies which aim for integrated regional development be better coordinated and new territorial indicators be adopted, together with GNP, which will allow development to be calculated and obstacles to development at regional level to be identified and evaluated."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Guellec for his report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development."
"The report is being discussed at a time when work on the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective is ongoing, and when the Council is considering cutting the resources devoted to the European Union’s regional policy."
"I trust the outcome of this debate will be that most of the resources the Commission proposed should be devoted to regional policy in the 2007-2013 Financial Perspective will escape cuts, in particular as concerns the new Member States."
"I should also like to endorse the rapporteur’s view about the importance of territorial cohesion to regional development."
"I come from the Mazowsze region."
"It is true that this is the richest region in Poland, as evidenced by the fact that we have the highest GDP per head of population in the country."
"At the same time, Mazowsze is the region with the most marked internal differences."
"According to estimates of GDP per head of population, it is likely that in the seven years between 2014 and 2020 Mazowsze will exceed 75% of the average GDP per head of population for the European Union, and will no longer qualify for support from the Structural Funds."
"Nonetheless, many parts of the region will remain characterised by a very low level of development."
"I have taken Mazowsze as an example, but the same is true of many other regions in the old and new Member States."
"I therefore hope that the European Union will devise additional instruments for use in such situations, and that territorial cohesion will become an important aspect of the Union’s future regional policy."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank the rapporteur for highlighting the role of spatial planning in cohesion policy, as it often goes unrecognised when planning regional development."
"Mr President, for two hours, many Members of the European Parliament from 25 different countries, using twenty different languages, have been expressing their views on regional development issues."
"Commissioner Hübner’s presence in this debate is very important for all of us and I would, of course, like to acknowledge the work of the two rapporteurs, Mr Guellec and Mr Marques."
"I believe that the two reports demonstrate a European reality which is very different to that of other territorial political entities and models."
"It would say that the European Union is characterised by a lack of territorial continuity."
"We are essentially a small peninsula off the great continent of Eurasia, with a very distant peninsular and island presence."
"It is very different, for example, to the great North American quadrilateral, which is enormously consistent, and it has great territorial diversity, which makes it very difficult to remain competitive compared to other similar territorial entities."
"Recognition of this regional reality and these regional policies is very important."
"I am a representative of an island region, an outermost region, very distant from the centre of Europe, but, as Mr Vergès said earlier, this type of region presents a different reality and aspect, since they take Europe out into the great oceans, the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean, in a different manner."
"But it would be impossible to try to redirect the whole of this population – we are talking, for example, in the case of the outermost regions, about 4 million inhabitants, who face difficulties competing in the Union’s great internal market — solely by means of economic protection measures."
"I would like to thank the Commission for the proposals it has made and, of course, express my support for the proposals of our rapporteur, Mr Marques, on the development of these regions within the context of a great European Union cohesion policy."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Guellec and my compatriot Mr Marques on their excellent reports."
"What emerges from these reports is that the stakeholders share a view of an ideal Europe that sees the priority of cultural diversity in their regions as the most important element of the EU’s development model."
"Regional policy is therefore a separate initiative and must not simply be subject to replicating the implementation of national policy at national and European level."
"Regional policy is an area of concepts, policy measures and action, which takes the relevant parts of national policy and adapts it to its own objectives and strategies."
"Regional policy in the EU has always been seen as something of a focal point, given public policy does need to intervene; after all, not everything is resolved merely by means of a functioning market, as some would still have you believe."
"Regional policy is the strongest way of ensuring territorial cohesion. Consequently, if the resources at its disposal become weakened, selfish interests will prevail and solidarity will be the loser, and without solidarity the feeling of belonging, the key element characterising European identity, will not be able to flourish."
"I therefore add my voice to the calls for the Commission to draw up a White Paper on this objective of territorial cohesion and to create a system of gauging the impact of Community policy on territorial cohesion."
"This has become even more of a priority, in my view, owing to the impact of the phenomenon of globalisation, given that some EU regions will be successful and others will lose out."
"In these new circumstances, regional policy requires a new driving force and for this reason I wish to commend the Commission for stepping up the integration of territorial issues into existing Community policies."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin, if I may, by congratulating Mr Marques on the thorough work that he carried out and wish to thank him for the attention he gave to the Azores perspective."
"Community policies have presented many challenges to the outermost regions."
"There have been welcome developments in some of these, such as restrictions placed on free access to the waters off the Azores, but also cases of incomprehensible backtracking on others."
"An example of the latter is the proposals to amend the specific supply arrangements proposed by the Commission, which, if implemented one day, would lead to total economic paralysis in the Azores."
"We are opposed to the ban on shipment of the only product covered by the ‘contradictory’ specific shipping arrangements, along with new arrangements designed to ban the shipment of any product containing goods covered by these supply arrangements, in breach of international and Community law governing rules of origin."
"The setting of insignificant quotas as regards quantities and products solely destined for exotic destinations such as Morocco, which has no traditional business links with the Azores, at the same time as a ban on shipments to traditional markets such as the Portuguese mainland, the United States and Canada, would be a sick joke if it did not feature, in black and white, in one of the Commission’s regulations."
"The procedures put forward by the Commission are, in any event, out of step with the structure of the internal market, impossible for small businesses with simplified tax arrangements to put into practice, deeply discriminatory and of an unprecedented administrative complexity."
"The President of the Commission’s statement that he accepts decisions made by the national European justice system to reject precautionary measures to stop shipments from the Azores is a very welcome sign."
"It is now crucial that, in the same way, all remaining legal provisions proposed are carefully reviewed."
"I therefore appeal for common sense to prevail, so as to ensure that the interests of a European cartel are not confused with the general interest and that a root and branch review can take place of the Commission’s legislative proposal."
"Mr President, I wish to make five brief remarks."
"I support both reports as they are well written and cover the most important points."
"My first remark is that I like the way in which the reports focus on one fund and one programme, as this streamlines the way in which we conduct our business and makes it more effective and less complex."
"That is a very welcome approach from both rapporteurs."
"My second remark concerns the territorial indicators."
"Coming from Finland, I think it very important that we do not just focus on GDP but broaden our view and look at how difficult it is to get to a place."
"I welcome the rapporteurs' proposals on that point."
"My third remark is that I am disappointed there is no mention of the northern sparsely populated regions in the reports."
"I urge anyone who has not been to Lapland to go and see what a real outermost region looks like."
"This was mentioned in Article 218 of the Constitution, and it is unfortunate that it is not going to be adopted on time."
"My fourth remark concerns the agencies."
"Agencies and the decentralisation of agencies are part of regionalisation."
"I do not mind that the Food Agency went to Parma – I can live with a Chemicals Agency – but we must be rational."
"As part of a rational regional policy we should look at where the seat of the European Parliament should be."
"I am not sure that it is good regional policy to fly or take the train to Strasbourg once a month."
"Finally, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs for including competitiveness and Lisbon in the reports."
"All in all, I support them."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking Commissioner Hübner for the fact-finding missions that she keeps undertaking in various parts of the Union."
"The basic point I would like to make about the report is that you cannot have ‘more Europe’ for less money, and so it is, to say the least, desirable that we should come to a speedy and realistic agreement on the Financial Perspective."
"The report itself, as is only right and proper, makes demands for an increase in economic and social cohesion in line with territorial cohesion, so that every citizen of the EU will be able to rely on the best possible state and political structures in making a success or his or her own life."
"What can the EU do about this?"
"For a start, it must establish a framework for the balanced economic, social and territorial development of the geographical area of the Community as a whole."
"Secondly the EU’s sectoral policies must therefore acquire this new territorial component and with it added European value."
"Thirdly, the Community’s diversity needs to be promoted, with the various regions supported in their specific interests, strengths and weaknesses for the sake of a polycentric regional policy."
"It is through such an all-embracing approach by EU policies, enhanced by the territorial component and with subsidiarity maintained, that we will be able to move the EU a significant step further down the road towards becoming a Union of all citizens."
"Particular attention needs to be given to disadvantaged regions such as rural mountainous areas, for which suitable indicators will have to be devised if we are to have a better picture of what their actual disadvantages are, for which existing models and calculation methods, such as, for example, per capita GDP, are not sufficient."
"There must also be a greater emphasis on the simplicity and practicability of Community policy if its effective implementation and application in every EU region is to be guaranteed."
"This is one instance where the ‘less is more’ principle is particularly applicable."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the main aims of territorial policy, as is correctly pointed out in the two reports, is the application of the principle of equality among citizens regardless of where in the European Union they live."
"Particular attention needs to be paid to the 9 400 000 inhabitants of the 284 islands of the European Union: 3% of the total population living in an area of 95 000 km2."
"Economic development in these areas is affected by their isolation and the additional costs that that causes."
"In many cases, these islands are mountainous and they are also less-developed outermost regions."
"Their average per capita GDP in 2004 was 72% of the EU average and in most cases lower than that of any other area in their respective countries."
"It must be pointed out, however, that those logistic difficulties do not necessarily equate to unfavourable economic circumstances."
"Such handicaps should potentially, in fact, be turned into advantages, opening the door to new development opportunities."
"These islands are part of our Union’s natural heritage and are particularly suitable for many kinds of activity, such as tourism, cultural and leisure pursuits."
"Amongst other things, with the development of a knowledge-based economy – a major Community policy objective – it is no longer closeness to raw materials or to major markets that leads people to choose where to live, but rather the natural beauty and amenities of the surrounding area."
"In that respect, the availability of infrastructure and essential facilities become decisive factors."
"Therefore, after introducing the ‘one fund per programme’ principle in the financial perspective for 2007-2013, we need to promote the territorial cohesion policy as an instrument that adds an essential resource, as these two reports have rightly done, and include it among the priority aims of the European Union’s cohesion policy in its broader sense."
". Mr President, that was an excellent debate on both reports and one to which I have listened carefully."
"With regard to Mr Guellec's report, I have taken note of the strong support in this House for the recommendations it puts forward: to consider territorial cohesion as a major element in the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies; to give a boost to all dimensions of territorial cooperation; and to place greater emphasis on cooperation between urban centres, suburban areas and the countryside, particularly those with specific disadvantages, so as to contribute to the development of sustainable communities."
"I am very pleased that we share many ideas."
"Let me respond to those few ideas on which I think we might have difficulty in finding a solution."
"First, with regard to the adoption of new territorial indicators, alongside GDP, to measure the development of regions and evaluate obstacles, I would remind you that there are no standardised and generally-accepted indicators in the field of territorial cohesion and, as you know, any new indicator needs to be accepted by Eurostat."
"There are currently only a small number of indicators available at regional level that have been harmonized: GDP, employment, unemployment and population data."
"Secondly, I agree that more work needs to be done in this area, but we must be realistic at this stage."
"On the issue of establishing a system for assessing the impact of the various Community policies on territorial cohesion within the Union, it is true that current impact assessment does not take into account territorial cohesion issues."
"I agree that this question deserves further examination."
"I have taken note of your proposal to develop such a system through Espon and I will ask my services to analyse this."
"We will also discuss it with the Member States, which, as you know, cofinance this programme."
"On your suggestion that a White Paper on territorial cohesion be drawn up by 2007, indicating in particular how this objective is to be incorporated in the national strategic plan of each Member State, you may remember that I raised the possibility of preparing a White Paper in order to promote territorial cohesion on the European agenda in the perspective of a ratified Constitution."
"That was done in Luxembourg in May."
"I would like to remind you that in the strategic guidelines we asked Member States to pay particular attention to territorial issues when preparing their national development plans."
"These are already being drawn up and so, while I agree strongly with the added value that the White Paper would bring, we cannot wait for it in order to incorporate this dimension into the national strategic plans."
"On Mr Margues' report, I have also noted a number of concerns and recommendations and I would like to respond to as many of them as I can in the time available to me."
"Concerning the wider neighbourhood action plan, I fully agree that we have to strengthen the economic, social and cultural links between the outermost regions and their non-member neighbours."
"We have to take this forward on two fronts: first, trade and customs measures that would allow for the integration of markets in goods and services, as well as in trade-related fields; and second, the preferential agreements with non-Member countries."
"This mainly concerns the ACP countries through the European partnership agreements."
"These new agreements are to enter into effect as of January 2008."
"We are currently in the process of negotiations, but we are also examining the needs and interests of those regions, together with the Member States concerned."
"I share your view that economic integration needs to be supported by exchanges of a social and cultural nature and cooperation in fields such as new technologies, health measures, combating illegal immigration and measures on the environment and risk prevention."
"I can also tell you that my services are currently exploring ways in which the Community financial instruments – not only the ERDF, but also the European Development Fund – can be used to strengthen the wider neighbourhood policy."
"With regard to agriculture and fishing, some of your recommendations are already part of our legislative proposals, as some of you must know."
"On the reform of the organisation of the sugar market, the Commission's proposal takes account of the specific problems of the outermost regions."
"The Commission is convinced that the sugar sector in the outermost regions is expanding, also in the context of its contribution to energy security."
"On the new agricultural fund, here, as you know, we have proposed maximum co-financing rates that are higher for the outermost regions, while the intervention areas have also been extended."
"On bananas, you know how difficult the negotiations are for us, but I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to protect the interests of Community producers."
"On fisheries, at the Council meeting of 21 June, the Commission declared that specific treatment was needed for this sector in the outermost regions."
"We have launched a study into this and will carefully examine the issue."
"On competitiveness, your recommendations concerning the competitiveness of regions and the attention to be devoted to the development of human capital constitute the centrepiece of the draft Community strategic guidelines for the next generation of cohesion programmes."
"In the area of research, we have introduced specific measures for the outermost regions in the draft seventh framework programme."
"With regard to state aid, the latest proposal for the rules on national regional aid contains a number of positive measures in favour of the outermost regions."
"Those regions will be considered within the scope of Article 87(3)(a)."
"They will also benefit from increased aid ceilings and will be able to authorise operating aid."
"My door is always open to those who need further detailed information."
"I believe that, at a time when so many proposals affect the situation of the outermost regions or regions in general, constant cooperation and communication are a must for all of us."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"The next item is the Commission communication on the screening of the legislative proposals pending before the Legislator."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at half past three this afternoon, the Commission adopted a communication on its ‘better lawmaking’ policy, and this communication was immediately forwarded to your House and to the Council."
"The Commission has undertaken a comprehensive and systematic review of all the draft legislation presented by it prior to 1 January 2004 and not yet adopted, and today sees its announcement of the outcome."
"I would also like to say that all the things that may have appeared in this or that newspaper do not amount to a decision by the Commission, and that most of them are wrong."
"Today’s communication is a first step, and a relatively small one, towards the completion of the far greater and more demanding project of ‘Better Lawmaking in Europe’, with which we have two ends in view, namely both to build up the public’s confidence in European integration and to counteract the impression that the European Union is a regulation-crazed and bureaucratic monstrosity."
"At the same time, we want to liberate the forces for growth in the economy that have been tied down by excessive or excessively complex rules and regulations."
"We must not underestimate the dangerous effect of the perception of Brussels as no more than an enormous and rather impenetrable bureaucracy, and this is where we all – in the Commission, Parliament and the Council – need to demonstrate by our actions that Europe is not like that."
"‘Better Lawmaking’ is also an essential part of the initiative for growth and employment."
"In Brussels, the Commission has stated that it, in its work, gives priority to growth and to the creation of more jobs."
"It has revised the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment with this in mind and highlighted the area of policy that can make a decisive contribution to the enhancement of growth and to the creation of jobs."
"‘Better Lawmaking’ is one of these core policy areas."
"From my many, many conversations with representatives of European businesses, I know that many of them regard it, indeed, as the most important."
"Small, medium-sized and micro-businesses in particular wait with longing to have their burdens removed."
"Securing Europe’s position as a business location and improving its chances in global competition are both absolutely dependent on our having a successful purge of red tape, annulling regulations that have become meaningless and offering industry and service providers a modern legal framework on which they can rely in the long term."
"I will speak plainly to you, honourable Members: this is not about the sort of deregulation that is weighed down with ideological baggage; this is about making regulation better."
"The single market needs an unambiguous and reliable legal framework, but we must also ensure that our societies are not weighed down with unnecessary bureaucracy, and that the public can be certain that European law is drafted with the greatest possible care and will take effect only where European regulations are absolutely necessary."
"That is something on which the institutions agree."
"Let me repeat that we are all in the same boat and share responsibility."
"That is the political context of the Commission communication on the review of pending legislative proposals."
"One might describe it as the of a menu, the main course of which is yet to be served."
"I do hope, though, that the goes down well."
"This policy forms part of a broader-based strategy, which is itself founded upon three pillars."
"Firstly, the Commission regularly submits to systematic examination all the legislative proposals it has presented, yet which have not been adopted by the legislator within a given period of time, the object of this exercise being to decide whether the proposals can be withdrawn, or whether decision-making can be made easier by other means."
"The Commission has, this year, reviewed all the regulations that were still waiting for adoption on the cut-off date of 1 January 2004, looking to see whether proposals had become obsolete, had been held up in the legislative process for some considerable time, whether their review was called for by reason of new scientific knowledge, changes in the market or other considerations, or whether they met present-day standards in terms of their expected cost and their likely effect on competitiveness."
"The end result of this is that, of the 183 proposals it has reviewed, the Commission intends to withdraw 68 on the grounds of their incompatibility with the goals of growth and employment or with the criteria for better lawmaking, their being – quite objectively speaking – no longer relevant, or the improbability of their making further progress through the legislative process in their present form."
"In the case of five of the proposals mentioned in the communication, the Commission recommends that the legislative process be proceeded with, although it does, before this happens, wish to submit in-depth economic analyses in order to help the legislative body to come to a decision."
"I would like to point out that some proposals are being withdrawn as part of a wide-ranging review of Community policies, although the Commission is retaining the option of, after this process, submitting revised proposals accompanied by a comprehensive assessment of their cost."
"I would also like to point out that the Commission, this afternoon, in communicating to the Council and Parliament which proposals it intends to withdraw, is complying with its obligations under the framework agreement on relations between it and Parliament."
"The proposals selected will be regarded as formally withdrawn only as and when an announcement to this effect is made in the Official Journal."
"Today’s communication is concerned with pending proposals for legislation, which constitutes the first part of the Commission’s strategy."
"As the itself is not tampered with in any way, it has no direct effect on the economic process."
"In evaluating the result, I think there are three things that it is important to bear in mind. One is that the number of pending proposals for legislation was far smaller than many had expected."
"In two-thirds of all cases, the review has led us to the conclusion that there are good reasons for the proposals to be retained, and only one-third of them overall fall short of our requirements in terms of better regulation."
"This screening process represents the first test for the credibility of our ‘Better Lawmaking’ policy and will be a trial run for the implementation of the real project, to which I shall now turn."
"That project is called ‘simplification of the regulatory framework’, and is the biggest project to be embarked on under the ‘Better Lawmaking’ policy."
"The Commission will now respond to the European Parliament’s resolution, adopted earlier this year, on the renewal of the Lisbon Strategy by proceeding to a comprehensive and systematic review of the European Union’s ."
"I am talking here about over 20 000 pieces of legislation."
"At the end of October, the Commission will come to a decision on the principles and criteria by which this will be guided, and on how, organisationally speaking, we are going to get on top of this gargantuan task."
"The one thing that is certain is that this Herculean labour will demand that all three institutions work as closely together as possible, and the Commission will inform Parliament as soon as a decision has been taken on the procedures and methodology."
"The third pillar has to do with the standards applicable to future legislation and the assessment of its impact."
"The Commission sees it as being of the utmost importance that lawmaking should, in future, be significantly improved and made subject to rigorous standards, and has already decided that all proposals for legislation, White Papers and policy statements underlying its work programme should be accompanied by comprehensive impact assessments."
"It has recently adopted detailed directives on the methodology to be used and will, next year, commission an external analysis of all the impact assessments already submitted."
"The Commission is also engaged, with the help of a network of outside experts, in building up the available analysis and scientific knowledge on which impact assessments rely."
"It regards the new criteria for future lawmaking as decisive in setting our direction for the future, and as making it possible to really cut back bureaucracy and take the burden off businesses and the authorities in the Member States."
"Some Member States have already adopted a policy of this kind and are achieving remarkable successes with it, freeing business and administration from unnecessary costs and thereby achieving measurable added growth."
"That is what we want for the European Union as a whole."
"This, honourable Members, is something that we will need to discuss in depth, and, while the Commission will have the utmost regard for Parliament’s responsibility, this policy will need to be supported by the Member States."
"I very much hope that this debate sends out the clear message that, this time, Europe is getting serious about this."
"One thing we all agree on is that we need better laws and less bureaucracy."
"Even at this early stage, I can tell you that this project of codifying disparate pieces of legislation is very far from being the end of what we shall do."
"We shall also be considering whether regulations are still needed at all or whether they need to be made more user-friendly, that is to say, rewritten."
"Europe’s competitiveness will be one yardstick – but not the only one – whereby this will be measured, and let me say, lest there be any doubt about it, that the object is not to make Europe less integrated than it already is or to alter the balance between the three great policy goals of growth, social cohesion and sustainable development."
"Far from ‘Better Lawmaking’ being some sort of Trojan horse to undermine Europe, the intention is it should strengthen Europe and make it more efficient."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I now give the floor to Mr Stubb."
"I am afraid I am not sure how I should pronounce your name, Mr Stubb."
"Mr President, Stubb is a very common Finnish name: you probably only need an 'inen' or 'onen' at the end to turn it into Hakkinen or Raikkonen or something along those lines."
"Commissioner, I welcome your initiative, it is an excellent one."
"But I am a little sad to see that the debate we have had in Parliament was derailed, in the sense that we immediately started to talk about process: why did you not come with the paper to us first?"
"Well, you have come to us, and we see it right here."
"It is a very good initiative."
"There is nothing new in this, it is part of improved regulation and it is something that we urgently needed, especially after the French and the Dutch referendums."
"If I have understood you correctly, you are going to withdraw 70 initiatives, which are: firstly, old; secondly, based on an impact assessment; or thirdly, based on subsidiarity."
"If that is the case, I am all for it."
"I can say this even though I sit at this end of the table."
"I am a federalist, I want more Europe, but I want less and better regulation."
"The problem with the European Parliament today is that we are putting up too many barriers and we should not do that."
"We need more freedom."
"Just give us one answer, what is your timetable, when do you want our answer?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, before the starter, there is often an ."
"Although this particular little culinary offering, having been brought to us courtesy of the media, was not to our taste, we still find a juicy preferable to a dry piece of paper."
"As for what you have served up to us today, we will have to look at the details."
"The philosophy you have described is, I think, one of which we can all approve."
"We are concerned not only that there should be no erosion of social and economic standards, but also that bureaucracy should be kept to a minimum, that regulations should be as simple as possible and be readable – not, perhaps, so much by the general public as by the experts, which these days they are not."
"We will also be discussing this with representatives of the national parliaments."
"I have just heard that there is to be a meeting of COSAC at the beginning of October, and this will certainly be on the agenda for that."
"I do have a specific question for you, Commissioner, and it is this: are you willing to make available to this House all the documentation on the basis of which you have drawn up this list, so that we may gain an insight into your motivation and your reasoning, and may then consider them when we give our own opinion?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to apologise for having to go to the next meeting straightaway, but there are two things I would like to mention that I believe are important where better lawmaking is concerned."
"I do not intend to discuss what should be done about the involvement of the press."
"This is the first step in the right direction; it is courageous and it is the right thing to do."
"We must give it our backing and encourage the Commission to move on to the ‘main course’, for that we regard as crucial."
"I have two suggestions to make."
"The first has to do with the small business sector, to which the Commissioner referred."
"Where better lawmaking is concerned, I can only hope that representatives of the small and medium-sized business sector will be included among the external groups of experts whose advice is to be sought."
"The fact is that industry can certainly cope with and accept certain aspects of regulation, but local small businesses and local craftsmen may well not be able to, and will go bust."
"So I ask, I appeal, as a matter of urgency, that these external groups give small and medium-sized enterprises the representation they deserve."
"The second point I want to make is that complaints from the national level about over-regulation are a regular occurrence, and it often turns out that, rather than the over-regulation originating from Europe, its cause is in fact to be found in the complicated way in which the Member States transpose it."
"What is needed is the boldness to highlight the perverse ways in which European rules are sometimes applied and bring in a benchmark to indicate who is acting in such a way as to benefit the public and who is doing it in such a way as to inconvenience them."
". Mr President, I would like to answer the questions that have been put to me."
"Let me take the timetable first: the Commission will come to a decision about the methodology and organisational principles of the great ‘Better Regulation’ project at the end of October."
"I will be putting to it an action plan for an initial three-year period in the hope that we will be able to get most of the project completed in that time."
"We will in any case have to decide what our priorities are, and we will do so in such a way that we start with the areas that there is reason to believe really are over-regulated by reason of the vast amount of legislation."
"We have already decided that sectors such as the automobile industry, the construction industry and waste management should be the first to be examined, with all the other sectors to follow on."
"In parallel with this, Commissioner Fischer Boel is already working on a fundamental programme for the simplification of the agricultural , the first package of which will be able to be presented this year."
"I am much obliged to Mr Swoboda for his support, and can tell him that I can give him the documents he needs right now, as I already have them to hand for him and for the other groups too."
"These documents will show you what stage the various projects had reached and the reasons why the Commission thinks they should be withdrawn."
"Perhaps I might make another brief observation concerning the media."
"Right now, I have no desire to bore the House or to torment it, but I could well, here and now, read out a list of the occasions on which I have appeared before it to inform it about this project."
"The first was as long ago as September 2004 – even before I was appointed."
"I have spoken to your House about this matter on a total of 11 occasions."
"Initial information was given to your House before the public heard even a word about it – although I do assume that the plenary of the European Parliament can be regarded as representing the European public."
"I do indeed insist that I have acted with absolute correctness as regards informing the European Parliament."
"Until this afternoon, and indeed until I stood up to speak here, neither I nor any of my staff gave the media any information about what is in the list."
"I have a certain reputation to maintain where my respect for your House is concerned, and so I hope I have made that perfectly clear."
"You will, of course, be given all this in black and white."
"Even though the Commission is entitled to decide independently of anyone else what to do with this list, I think it highly advisable to wait and see what advice we get from Parliament and to act on it when implementing what is decided."
"The Commission has agreed to this."
"Turning to the final question, for which I am extremely grateful, my concern about the economic future of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe was one of the reasons why I proposed this project in the first place."
"I am perfectly well aware that big business and major firms can handle regulation with relative ease; they can afford to have their own departments to deal with it."
"The smaller a company is, though, the more burdensome it finds the costs involved in dealing with red tape and the more difficult it is for it to plan and make investments and actually achieve some growth."
"I can, then, assure you that the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises will be considered in all that we do."
"The external expertise on which we will draw will of course include that of the representatives of the small business sector."
"Our future policy on small and medium-sized enterprises is due to be announced in a communication in only a few weeks’ time, and there will be a great deal in that, too, about the issue of better regulation."
"I am just as grateful for what you have had to say about transposition at national level."
"There are indeed some quite fascinating examples of how Member States have managed to take a short, clear and straightforward European directive and turn it into a bureaucratic monster with many times the number of words needed."
"There is a splendid English expression for this: ‘gold plating’."
"Part of this project, to my mind, has to do with us explaining to the European public that this sort of thing has to stop, and that European legislation cannot be used as a sort of protective screen behind which nation states run their pet projects and do things that they would not dare to do otherwise."
"That, I think, should answer all your questions."
"I am grateful for the political support offered to me by three of your speakers, and offer you close and trusting cooperation in this project, which will have a particular impact on all three institutions."
"Madam President, I too welcome the Commission statement, particularly as far as the optical radiation directive is concerned."
"I am delighted that the Commission is joining with us in Parliament to call for natural radiation to be taken out, and for the temporary workers directive to be looked at."
"I have always felt that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work."
"I hope that the Commission might look again at another physical agents directive, the electromagnetic fields directive, and how it will affect MRI scanners, in terms of bringing in static magnetic fields."
"We need health and safety legislation, yes; but only when it is necessary at EU level and when it cannot be done at Member State level."
"For instance I would like to see a specific directive on needlestick injuries."
"I would like, under Article 13, to see a specific directive on age and on disability."
"Nevertheless I welcome what the Commission is saying."
"There is unnecessary regulation and, speaking as a pro-European, I think it does us more harm than good."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue for us is one of substance and not form."
"It is all very well to withdraw a few directives; indeed there are some that we would really love to see withdrawn, such as the Bolkestein directive, but unfortunately it is still there."
"What concerns us, however, is the emphasis given to this exercise, which is absolutely uncalled-for, because trying to win the people over by undoing what has been done seems to us to be rather questionable, to say the least."
"Commissioner, after you have seen and listened to industry, I would really urge you to go and meet the consumers’ association as well, as they uphold people’s rights and environmental rights."
"I am sure that you will meet people who will tell you that competitiveness is much more than what you have been trying to propose to us, alas, for about a year."
"I also think that in connection with the impact assessment question and other topics that you have raised here, such as screening, there are outstanding problems that may seem innocent enough but unfortunately are not: just look at the demolition job that you – you yourself and the Commissioner and President Barroso – are performing on REACH and have already performed on the pollution strategy."
"I therefore sincerely expect a clear answer from you on these two topics."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we agree with better law-making."
"Clearly, we would like there to be less pernickety bureaucracy and we would like to give business a bit of air."
"However, what is your vision for cooperation with the European Parliament, which is a co-legislator?"
"Even though it is not provided for in the Treaty, in view of the interinstitutional agreement, how do you see the participation of our parliamentary committees?"
"With regard to the impact assessment, which we called for, it must not turn into automatic justification for the Commission’s proposal or into justification for doing nothing."
"What will happen, also, to the impact assessment on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament?"
"Finally, with regard to simplification, which is very important, we must take care that it does not lead to deregulation."
"Meddling with the Community acquis in the field of social affairs, the environment or consumer protection could lead to social dumping."
"We will therefore be very vigilant."
"Better law-making does not have to mean fewer laws."
"What place is given to standardisation?"
"The European Parliament draws its legitimacy from codecision."
"We must not reduce its legislative power."
". Madam President, my answer to the first question is that we will, of course, be happy to take up any suggestions, including those being made in this sitting."
"I am able to inform you that I have invited the Member States, the business associations, the consumers’ groups, the trade unions and all members of the European public to submit their own proposals to us, and these have been coming in in their hundreds, many of them very detailed and very precise."
"What this tells me is that this project really does enjoy widespread support."
"In response to Mrs Frassoni’s question, I would like to say that this is something I have tried to explain."
"It strikes me as being an issue of political trust."
"As I have said, and as I will emphasise once again, the object of the exercise is not to alter the quality of the in any particular section."
"The initiative is not intended to deregulate in the sense in which the radical ideologues of the free market use the term, but to simplify the existing system of legislation, making it more transparent and more user-friendly."
"In saying this, I am saying, as I have already said in your hearing on numerous occasions, that the European model actually consists in balancing growth and employment, social cohesion and sustainable development, and that is something of which we are not, of course, going to let go."
"Mrs Frassoni can take my word for it: nothing like what she fears will actually happen, and none of the standards we have already achieved will be made less rigorous."
"To Mrs Grossetête, I can say that Parliament’s rights of participation will of course be retained."
"I think that one of the consequences of the simplification project will even be that Parliament will be able to avail itself of rights in ways that it could not have done originally, as we will be resubmitting acts that were adopted at a time when there was as yet no codecision in the areas to which they apply."
"I believe that what we do will enhance Parliament’s rights of codecision, and the Commission is of course willing to report to all the committees on what happens."
"The whole question of the impact assessment is a difficult one, and one that I did have something to say about."
"For its own part, the Commission has decided that it will no longer be making proposals before a comprehensive assessment of the costs resulting from them has been carried out."
"Although that is an internal procedure within the Commission, we will present you with the results from it at the same time as we forward proposals to you."
"Speaking personally, I take the very definite view that a further impact assessment will of course be needed if the legislator does what it is there to do and makes substantial changes to the Commission proposal."
"That, though, is a decision for you yourselves to take, for it is you, and not the Commission, that are the legislative body; if you say that you can adopt an act even without an impact assessment, then that is your decision and your responsibility."
"I would, however, advise that we should, together, look for a way in which we can come up with a generally acceptable method of assessing the impact of legislation."
"I think we can actually be very proud of the fact that the impact assessment developed by the Commission has an extremely good reputation internationally, and, while I do not believe that you will find anything better anywhere in the public sphere, there is still room for improvement, and that is something we can work on together."
"I do indeed agree with Mrs Grossetête that we do not necessarily need less lawmaking, but that lawmaking does need to be better in future."
"Let me reiterate that we are talking here about two different things."
"One is the great project of simplification, which will indeed result in a marked reduction in the volume – mark well, the quantity, rather than the quality – of the ."
"The actual result of the other project, the new method whereby we draft legislation, will be a significant increase in its quality, and you, the Members of the European Parliament, being the people who make the laws, will be enabled to arrive at a very precise account of the costs and benefits of every individual decision."
"Madam President, the Commissioner made his statement in a rather solemn fashion, as if we were witnessing an historic moment, and I think it is one."
"Today’s decision by the Commission is, of course, historic."
"It is about the image that the European Union creates and that image will not change unless reality changes, which I believe also to be the case."
"He claims that ‘it is an appetiser’, but we would be wrong to think that this is merely cosmetic."
"I think that the Commission’s proposals do have teeth."
"It is quite extraordinary – with all due respect to the Commissioner – for bureaucracy to come up with proposals for less bureaucracy."
"So turkeys may be able to vote for Christmas after all."
"The Commissioner is right to give Parliament and the Council some of the responsibility, since it is from this House and the Council that much of the small print in legislation originates."
"I think that Mrs Grossetête was also right when she made reference to this: ‘How can we prevent this process from continuing?’"
"We have our own responsibility that we should take quite seriously."
"Finally, since you have a website where citizens are invited to add their comments, could you give us an idea, in a nutshell and on a regular basis, of the feedback you get from this?"
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his statement."
"We too are in favour of the scrapping of needless or redundant laws, but we do have some concerns, partly fed by the way President Barroso came out shooting from the hip in the on the subject of deregulation."
"The main concern for me is the persistent rumour, just repeated by Mrs Lynne, that either now or in the near future the Commission will include the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency work."
"Will you agree with me, Commissioner, that if that happened it would be a major blow to attempts to balance flexibility and security and would damage the balanced pursuit of Lisbon?"
"Can you assure us that the Commission is not considering the withdrawal of the directive on temporary agency workers?"
"Madam President, Commissioner Verheugen can take it from me that bureaucracy is, of course a slogan guaranteed to get you applause, but a look at his list reveals that it conceals the real object of the exercise, which is the demolition of the welfare state."
"If it is indeed the case that the Temporary Workers Directive is to be withdrawn, then that is a slap in the face for social Europe, then we will see ‘the working poor’ in Europe, for that means that this aspect will be covered by the Bolkestein Directive, and that Europe’s minimum standards are being eroded."
"What I want to know is this: how do you propose to build a social Europe by dismantling minimum social standards in Europe?"
"Madam President, I will answer the first question by saying that we have initiated a public consultation, and you will of course be able to have access to what emerges from it."
"I really must say that Mrs Schroedter is wrong in making what is in fact an insinuation."
"The withdrawal of proposals that have not even yet been adopted cannot be said to dismantle anything."
"It cannot do anything to change what is actually law."
"I am talking here about proposals that the European Parliament has not even yet adopted, and the Commission will, in every single instance, be giving a precise explanation of why it is withdrawing them."
"I made a point of adding that this does not mean that we will not be bringing these matters back to your House."
"As regards temporary workers, we suggest that Parliament should not wind up its deliberations before the Commission has presented more comprehensive economic analyses and an extensive impact assessment."
"The proposal has not been withdrawn, and I have no idea whence you have that information."
"You must not believe everything you read in the newspapers;"
"I would appreciate it if our deliberations were to relate only to what the Commission has officially communicated to you in its proposal."
"What matters is not what the newspapers print, but what the Commission has decided this afternoon."
"To Mr Maaten, I want to say I had no intention of making a ceremony of my statement;"
"I mentioned the hour of the day only because I wanted to demonstrate to you that, as soon as the Commission had agreed on its resolution, the European Parliament – and nobody else – was informed about it."
"That concludes the debate on this item."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0331/2005)."
"We will be taking a number of questions to the Commission."
"The current world situation regarding infectious animal diseases is very worrying."
"The FAO recently warned that bird flu is likely to be carried to the Middle East and Europe by migrating birds."
"Foot and mouth disease recently reached Russia via China and Central Asia."
"What measures is the Commission taking to prevent these infectious animal diseases from spreading into the EU?"
"What geographical region do these measures emphasise?"
"What is the role of vaccination?"
"How are people in Europe informed, for example about the ban on importing food from third countries in luggage?"
"As Commissioner Kyprianou has been held up by a meeting on precisely this problem, he has asked me to stand in for him, and I am pleased to do so."
"I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to restate the commitment we made to inform the European Parliament systematically and transparently on the issue of the spread of infectious animal diseases in Europe."
"Commissioner Kyprianou, who is responsible for health and consumer protection, has kept your Parliament informed of the latest developments and of the measures taken by the Commission."
"Yesterday evening, he presented the situation regarding animal health to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as he had also done to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 14 September."
"The Commissioner has also already provided the honourable Member with information in writing on the action taken by the Commission to control these threats."
"The discovery of outbreaks of avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease in Asia of course gave rise to fears that these diseases would arrive in the European Union."
"All the legal measures needed to prevent the possibility of these diseases being introduced via animals and products of animal origin have already been taken."
"These include, in particular, the requirement to inform passengers in international ports and airports of their obligations in this regard."
"The Commission uses its regulatory powers to ensure that the existing provisions are continually updated."
"It is in this connection that the Member States were recommended to strengthen the application of existing measures and controls at the EU’s borders in order to ensure that only animals and products that meet Community requirements are imported."
"As regards vaccination, emergency vaccination is already possible if outbreaks of avian influenza are discovered."
"The Commission has proposed a new directive regarding avian influenza."
"This proposal will enable us to adopt an approach to vaccination that takes into account the latest scientific developments in knowledge of the disease and the most recent epidemics."
"Clearly, we must not forget that vaccination on its own cannot guarantee proper prevention and control of the disease."
"With regard to foot-and-mouth disease, similar provisions have already been put in place."
"Those are the answers I wished to give on behalf of Mr Kyprianou, Madam President."
"Madam President, I thank the Commissioner and his colleague, Mr Kyprianou, for the response."
"There are two points on which I would appreciate a straightforward answer from the Commission."
"The Commissioner states that vaccination cannot be prevention, but that means that we should let it happen first before we use the vaccine, while the vaccine is already available."
"Poultry already receives 10 different types of vaccines, so why not add one against avian flu?"
"It exists, we can use it, and it is being produced in the European Union."
"So why are poultry farmers and countries not given the opportunity to use it to prevent an outbreak of the disease?"
"The same applies to legislation."
"We have just been talking about the simplification of legislation."
"The use of a preventive vaccine would lead to far fewer rules in the EU, and that must surely appeal to the Commission."
"I did not say that vaccination was not useful."
"I am simply saying, and I even stated specifically, that emergency vaccination was already possible if outbreaks of avian influenza were discovered."
"We know, of course, that vaccination is a preventative measure but that it is not enough and that we must, at the same time, draw up a whole series of provisions that the draft directive aims to lay down."
"That is why I think, Mr Maat, that the Commission is not at all reticent with regard to vaccination."
"We also hope to develop this vaccination in view of all the scientific data that enable us to increase our knowledge of the disease, but the Commission would like to have a broader provision than simple vaccination to prevent the introduction of this disease into Europe."
"Some constituents recently contacted me in connection with difficulties experienced in relation to a My Travel Airways holiday charter flight from Canaria to Glasgow."
"They experienced 15 hours of delay and enormous inconvenience but received no compensation from the charter flight company."
"They were among 49 passengers denied boarding because of airline regulations on crew shortage after a crew member had to be taken to hospital."
"My constituents sought compensation under recent EU legislation on denied boarding, but My Travel maintained that the new rules did not apply to the case as 'the reason for the delay was unforeseen circumstances'."
"Could the Commission indicate whether holiday charter flights are bound by EU legislation on compensation for air passengers and whether staff shortages may be defined as an unforeseen circumstance under EU legislation?"
"Madam President, I would like to inform Mrs Stihler that charter flights are also covered by the scope of Regulation 261/2004."
"As such, airlines operating this type of flight are of course obliged to comply with the provisions of that regulation."
"From what you said, this was a case of a long delay caused by a crew shortage, and therefore not denied boarding."
"In this case, no financial compensation is laid down as it is for denied boarding and cancellations."
"Nevertheless, airlines are of course obliged to provide appropriate assistance – drinks, food, means of communication and hotel rooms, as appropriate – in order to minimise the inconvenience suffered by passengers."
"This assistance is compulsory in the case of denied boarding, long delays and cancellations, even if they are due to ."
"With regard to financial compensation, airlines are only exempted from providing it for cancellations and denied boarding caused by exceptional circumstances."
"So, can a crew shortage be considered to be an exceptional circumstance?"
"This matter must be assessed on an individual basis, in view of all the factual aspects, in particular the organisation of replacements and the availability of reserve crews on site."
"Mrs Stihler, you will appreciate that, without all those details, the Commission cannot issue a definitive judgment."
"However, on the basis of Article 16(2) of the regulation, passengers may now complain, if necessary, to national monitoring bodies specially authorised to deal with their complaints and their differences with airlines."
"I think that is all I can say, given that the best of regulations cannot cover all specific situations and that such situations need to be assessed case by case, on the basis of all the elements."
"In this specific case, it would be necessary to check whether replacement staff were available at the local airport for a return flight or whether organisational provisions were in place."
"As I said, though, the passengers in question now have the option of turning to the body set up at national level to deal with their complaints."
"It is an interesting case."
"I find it fascinating that when air stewardesses have colds and cannot travel on an airline there must be immediate backup to cover staff shortages in those circumstances."
"So I wonder whether in this case the systems were just not in place."
"Only today another Scottish constituent, a Mr Duncan Thorpe, raised the question as to whether a delay of five hours or more entitles him to compensation."
"According to the Europa website, where there is a delay of five hours or more the airline must offer to refund the ticket."
"Yet the company that replied to my constituent stated, and I quote: 'Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 does not impose any obligation on carriers to offer or pay compensation when passengers are delayed'."
"Can the Commission outline how it is monitoring the successful implementation of this directive?"
"Thank you for your consideration, Madam President: it is an important matter."
". It is clear that this regulation includes an obligation for each Member State to set up an authority capable of investigating requests."
"However, this regulation is too recent for me to be able to give you an assessment of its implementation today."
"It goes without saying, Mrs Stihler, that we will ensure that these new provisions on passenger rights can indeed be implemented in practice;"
"I can assure you that we will see to it that, as of 2006, we will be able to make an assessment that will enable us, where appropriate, Madam President, Mrs Stihler, to further strengthen, if need be, the measures taken."
"I would stress, however, that we are in the early stages of a policy that aims to provide passengers with a guarantee of new rights."
"You must, of course, give us some time to assess the implementation measures and, perhaps, to strengthen or correct them."
"Commissioner, like the questioner I too have received queries from my constituents."
"This is an area that is extremely badly understood by the public."
"It is one of the great benefits of Europe which we have recently brought to the public and we should publicise it much better."
"I am not suggesting a new directive, but could the 25 Commission information offices in the 25 national capitals not put the details on their websites and print a one-page leaflet providing the public with real information on their rights, which may be obscured by the airlines?"
". Thank you for your suggestion."
"The charter is, of course, already displayed in airports, and it refers to a national body responsible for investigating complaints."
"That said, you are right that we need to go further in informing consumers and in this field we need to develop much more specific communications that are much more accessible to all."
"I would ask you to be forgiving, because these provisions are new, but I assure you that I personally am seeing to it that the provisions that I proposed and that Parliament and the Council have agreed to adopt will really be applied."
"For this to happen, we must indeed inform people."
"Thank you for your suggestion and thank you, too, to the author of the question, Mrs Stihler, for having given some specific examples."
"It is on the basis of these examples that we will gradually create a body of case-law and also achieve better application of the texts."
"Commissioner, a few weeks ago I underwent the experience of being denied boarding by one of the main European national airlines, and the rights that were read to me then were not in line with the rules approved by this European Parliament."
"Does the Commission know which, and how many, Member States have transposed the European legislation and incorporated it into their own legislation, and which, and how many, have not?"
"."
"Madam President, we are talking about a regulation; consequently, no transposition is required."
"To put it simply, you can notify me by letter of the Member State to which you are referring, and I will make every effort to check whether, in this instance, the Member State has indeed set up the body responsible for monitoring the application of the provisions in question."
"The air disasters which occurred during the summer have heightened concerns, particularly among airline employees and the users of airline services."
"Inadequate checks, which employees themselves say are largely due to deregulation of the markets and fierce competition, the contravention of safety rules to achieve immediate and maximum profit, and the welter of companies appearing and disappearing from the market without providing the necessary safety guarantees, are transforming transport from a social service into a business whose sole motive is profit."
"Does the Commission consider that the single open sky and the uncontrolled pursuit of profit have contributed to the reduction in checks? Will it take measures to ensure that effective safety checks are made on all flights and take account of employees' proposals (e.g. pre-flight checks by a qualified, licensed mechanic)?"
". Madam President, first of all, I can well understand the emotion that followed all of those accidents in August."
"Obviously the Commission cannot comment on the causes of those accidents: that is a job for the experts."
"I would like to say to Mr Pafilis that we cannot draw a connection between liberalisation, the opening up of air travel to competition, and any safety issue that could be attributed to this opening up to competition."
"It could also be borne in mind that, at the same time as liberalising the internal market in air travel, the Commission strengthened the safety rules."
"The Community in the field of aviation safety has grown considerably and changes in safety-related data show that the numbers of accidents and deaths have continued to fall since the launch of the liberalisation process."
"This process, at the same time, has made it possible to give many European citizens the option of cheaper air travel."
"Having said that, safety is, now more than ever, a top priority for the aviation industry, and monitoring of Community aircraft, which is, of course, the responsibility of the national authorities, which have the freedom to refuse to grant a licence, is a point that we must monitor very carefully."
"With regard to pre-flight checks, the provisions in force require Community airlines to comply with very strict safety standards."
"The applicable operational regulations have been drawn up by the Joint Aviation Authorities."
"These rules specify that an operator shall ensure that all personnel assigned to, or directly involved in, ground and flight operations are properly instructed, have demonstrated their abilities in their particular duties and are aware of their responsibilities and the relationship of such duties to the operation as a whole."
"I have quoted rules that could, Madam President, have been expressed in simpler terms, for which I apologise."
"I would really like European texts to be simpler, but this is a text by the Joint Aviation Authorities."
"What I would like to say, in response to Mr Pafilis, is that, since the beginning of February, I have taken the initiative of asking the Council of Transport Ministers about the possibility of drawing up a European list of companies that have been subject to bans or flight restrictions."
"It has to be said that, due to the cautiousness of the Member States, we have progressed less quickly than I would have liked."
"Then, this summer, came the air disasters of which you are aware and to which Mr Pafilis referred, and it was at that point that Parliament, presented with this amended proposal for a regulation, adopted, at the proposal of Mrs De Veyrac as rapporteur, some extremely positive amendments harmonising the criteria under which a company can be banned or have its flight options restricted."
"I think that this proposal can now be adopted fairly rapidly, in November."
"I will therefore be able to draw up this European blacklist, which, obviously, will enable citizens to be better informed regarding the quality of the air operator they are using."
"Then there is the problem of third countries."
"The Commission has also worked to institute stricter controls with the famous SAFA Directive."
"That is indeed a directive, and it must be transposed in all Member States. It must be transposed before April 2006."
"By relying firstly on the draft regulation on the identity of the operator, which includes assessment criteria for companies that will enable us to get started on the blacklist, and also on the SAFA directive, transposed in all the Member States, with regard to the aircraft of third countries, this will give us an instrument that, I hope, will mark a very important step in aviation safety."
"Those are the various points I wanted to make to Mr Pafilis who, quite rightly, questioned me on the safety of air transport."
"– Commissioner, if this situation continues until 2020, we shall have one accident a week."
"In other words, sacrifice of human life for the sake of profit."
"This is not our appraisal; it is the appraisal of the International Air Transport Agency."
"It is precisely on this point that we consider that the policy of liberalisation, of so-called 'free competition', has created a situation of unaccountability which, among other things, makes victims both of its passengers and the workers themselves."
"Both the governments and everyone involved, from either the public sector or the private sector, are fully aware of the state of aircraft, just as they are fully aware of the huge problems which crews face with the pressure exerted on them from changes in labour relations."
"You are not doing anything about this; you are doing the opposite."
"As I do not have much time, I ask you this: why do you not withdraw the directive which allows checks to be carried out by unlicensed mechanics on the aircraft in question, rather than allowing this practice, which has proven to be a disaster?"
". Mr Pafilis, I do not know which directive you mean."
"I would simply repeat that you cannot claim that the European Union has not strengthened safety legislation."
"We now have a European Aviation Safety Agency, which is recognised as having the desired authority, including by the US FAA."
"My predecessor – and I myself will continue along this path – really did strengthen the whole body of safety legislation."
"You are right: we cannot open the aviation industry up to competition without at the same time ensuring that we have a solid regulatory framework regarding safety."
"We are, however, making progress, and I would like to pay tribute, Madam President, to the European Parliament, which has helped us a great deal in this matter."
"I am very happy to see that we are going to have absolutely identical criteria in all the Member States where, as you know, the civil aviation authorities are responsible for safety."
"We will therefore have common criteria that will enable us, with regard both to European companies and companies from third countries, to ascertain that a company cannot transport passengers because it does not provide the necessary security guarantees."
"I think that we certainly still have a lot of work to do in this field, but we have already taken a big step forward and I will tell you quite plainly that I am not one of those who will allow competition to become established outside a precise and effective regulatory framework regarding safety."
"– Commissioner, the report on the Helios aircraft which crashed in Grammatiko is now out: both pilots had heart conditions."
"One had heart arteries which were 90% blocked."
"In other words, he was almost dead before he died."
"That is what happens when small airlines fly without checks being carried out."
"We in Greece have Olympic Airways, a company which has not had the slightest accident in 30 years."
"You, of course, are sounding its death knell at the moment."
"I make a plea on behalf of the Greek people to give Olympic Airways a chance so that we have the security of flying with this airline."
"Forget competition."
"There may, nonetheless, be a way of securing the survival of this national airline, which is a guarantee for Greece and Europe."
"Are you thinking about giving Olympic Airways a chance, Commissioner?"
"It is, if you like, useful for Greece ..."
". Mr Karatzaferis, I am shortly going to propose extending the competences of the European Aviation Safety Agency, which will enable it, in particular, to monitor flight procedures and everything related to the human factor, because you are right that pilots must be properly trained and must be able to pilot aircraft."
"This proposal will be tabled shortly and, believe me, we are quite determined to keep a close eye on those companies that do not provide the necessary guarantees."
"That will also be the purpose of the blacklist, the updating of which will be greatly facilitated by the work of the European Aviation Safety Agency."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, we have no need for sentimentality and bombast on such a serious issue and we believe that you really do need to get a grip on this problem."
"The problem of the safety of air carriers is not going to be resolved with black, yellow, green or red lists."
"We really do need to get to the nub of the matter and identify the causes."
"This is where you really need to check with your colleagues, especially as you have received a letter to this effect from the parties directly involved and interested, the mechanics responsible for pre-flight checks on aircraft, that the directive of the European Union – the number of which escapes me at the moment – allows for checks to be carried out by employees ..."
". I would like to remind you that the blacklist concerned, which, I hope, will come into being early in 2006, will result in companies being banned from operating throughout the territory of the European Union."
"It is, after all, a very rigorous measure, which means that it will probably have a very dissuasive effect, as companies that do not meet the security standards will know that they risk being put on the blacklist, in other words of being banned from flying over the whole of the European Union."
"Recent events have shown that, up until now, there were bans issued by national civil aviation authorities that did not apply over the whole territory of the European Union."
"That was obviously not very reassuring for the people of Europe."
"However, this step that, I hope, we will take at the beginning of 2006, will give us a guarantee that unreliable companies will feature on the blacklist and will experience all the disadvantages of being banned from flying over the European Union."
"In reply to my written question E-2710/04 concerning the national land registry, the Commission indicated that the Greek Government proposal did not include the legal validation of active property rights and that the Commission did not envisage any further financial contributions to the land registry project."
"In fact, the proposal is seeking funding for an interim rather than a finalised project which means that no guarantees can be given regarding its completion."
"What measures have been taken to ensure that even this minimal funding will in fact lead to the establishment of the land registry?"
"What is the reason for the extremely low level of Community funding, in particular for the maintenance of a digital database of active property titles and how can this be reconciled with facile demands for a finalised result?"
". Indeed there is a question about the project data and IT infrastructure for a modern land registry that is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund."
"The purpose of this project is to establish a digital database of registered active property rights, which are presently recorded on paper in mortgage offices, together with a spatial reference."
"This electronic registry of active titles will certainly offer a valuable service to citizens and business."
"We are confident that this project can be completed quickly and quite cheaply."
"Also, the project will establish coastal and forest zones according to Greek legislation, where there is a presumption of state ownership of the land except in urban areas."
"It will be for the Greek state to pursue its claim to ownership, in the manner it considers appropriate."
"The legal validation of active property rights is not included in the project co-financed by the European Union through the ERDF; that action will be financed exclusively from national funds."
"In our view that is sufficient explanation for the apparently low level of Community funding for the project to which the honourable Member referred."
"The Greek authorities requested an ERDF co-financing rate of 50%, a level that the Commission has approved."
"I believe that answers Mr Papadimoulis' basic question."
"– I thank you, Commissioner, for your reply, but I want to ask you a specific question: on 5 October 2001, the Commissioner responsible at the time, Mr Barnier, announced the conditional continuation of cofinancing for the entire national land register in Greece."
"Today, according to your announcements, on the basis of valid calculations, there is only funding of 2.5% of the overall cost of the project, which totals EUR 1.65 billion."
"I ask you therefore: to what do we owe this huge reduction in the Community contribution?"
"Why is the Commission refusing further funding, as Mr Barnier promised?"
". The financing provided by the Commission is EUR 40 million – 50% of this element of the project – which comes under the ERDF co-financing system."
"The reason is that the remaining part – the legal validation of the property rights – cannot be included in the co-funded project because the Commission considers this a legal matter and one that is therefore outside the scope of the co-funded project."
"As you probably know, the legal framework in this context in Greece is quite unstable: it changes fairly often."
"It is therefore the responsibility of the Greeks to finalise the land registries, for which we provide technical instruments through our financing of this project."
"It must be said that the legal validation work would consist largely of the work of the lawyers, so that expenditure – which would take the form of lawyers' fees and similar costs – would, in any case, not be eligible for finance from the ERDF."
"That is the reason for this low level of financing and why the Commission cannot provide financial assistance for the remaining part of the project."
"– Madam President, I too join my voice – the voice of opposition against the previous Greek Government – with that of Mr Papadimoulis: his opposition stance is understandable, since he has referred to the year 2001."
"The Commissioner is being called on to answer, to clarify why there is no provision for further funding for the land registry project, to clarify the negative aspects of this entire dossier from 2001 onwards."
"Of course, I will not omit to say that I consider it important to fund precursor products supporting the land register, supporting the land registrations which will follow."
". Madam President, I should say one more thing to help explain why the level of funding is so low."
"We should bear in mind that this project will generate revenues;"
"Greek citizens will have to pay a fee when requesting the certificates."
"That was one of the factors that prevented us from offering higher cofinancing."
"You referred to something that took place in 2001 and I am not sure that I remember it correctly."
"There was a previous land registry project in Greece which was a failure – if I may put it that strongly – and that is why the Commission decided to recover the full amount of the contribution."
"We then started to reach agreement on the second project when we identified the part of the project which we could finance without any doubts or problems."
"I understand that there are many concerns, which you have expressed here."
"I can offer to look into it more deeply and, with my colleagues in the DG, to see whether this limited participation is justified on the evidence available."
"At this stage, that is all I can offer."
"I will ask to be informed once more about all the details that prompted this funding level of EUR 40 million."
"That is all I can say at the moment."
"– Commissioner, you are considered to be a responsible and serious politician in our country."
"We have the following problem with the land registry: it cost 26 times more than planned."
"Less land, more money, including European Union money."
"The question is straightforward."
"The issue is debated frequently in parliament and raised in the Greek press: do you intend to ask the Greek Government to prosecute those who took this money?"
"Do you intend to ask that those who stole the money from the Greek people and the European Union go to court and submit their defence?"
". I am planning to go to Greece on or around 20 October, when the Commission will certainly look into any potential irregularities, with the authorities."
"I have not been informed of any irregularities with regard to this project, but the matter will certainly be investigated, just to be on the safe side."
"According to Greek press reports, there exists a document from the Ministry of Economic Affairs addressed to the relevant Commission directorate-general which states that the Greek authorities admit that for 2005 the take-up target will be missed by 1 billion euros in the best-case scenario so that the planned take-up of 5 billion euros will not be achieved."
"Does such a document exist?"
"If so, what else does it say, who has signed it and what explanation does it give for the failure (foreseen by the Greek authorities themselves) to achieve the target they had set?"
". You ask whether we have received a letter from the Greek authorities containing the information to which you allude."
"I can tell you that the Commission has not received such a letter, but we have discussed the forecasts for payment with Greece, as we do with all the Member States several times a year."
"In the context of our discussions with Greece on the forecast for payments in 2005 we noticed the potential risk of an absorption shortage by the end of the year."
"Both the Greek Government and the Commission are aware of that potential risk."
"That is why, back in July, the Director General of DG Regio, Mr Graham Meadows, wrote to the Greek Government concerning the N+2 payments and cohesion fund commitment targets for the year."
"After that letter was sent a meeting was held – around a week ago – between the Greek authorities and the Commission."
"As I mentioned, I am planning my own visit and will discuss this issue when I meet representatives of the Greek Government in October."
"It is my understanding, from the meetings the services have had, that there is a clear commitment not only on our part but also on that of Greece to do everything possible to avoid any decommitment this year, although such a risk does exist."
"– Madam President, we are talking about the loss of one-third of the third support package."
"This was also said by the Commissioner who was responsible several years ago and who is now in the Greek Parliament."
"There is a letter from the Minister of Economic Affairs to the prime minister of Greece in which there is talk of such an extensive loss."
"Have you investigated why Greece is behind?"
"Why can it not take up money, especially at a time when it has a 6% deficit and needs every last euro?"
"Why does Greece find it so easy to reject several billion euros?"
"What is the reason?"
"Have you any information on the matter?"
". We know that the Greeks need funds, as indeed do other Member States which use our funds, and as soon as I was informed there were problems with absorption capacity we worked very closely with the authorities to help as much as we could on the Commission side to solve the problem."
"Nevertheless, one should also take into account the fact that this year still has some months to run, so if there is full involvement – which I believe there is on the Greek side – we can try to avoid losing the funds within this year's allocation for Greece."
"It is too premature to talk about concrete figures because my experience of the last one-and-a-half months of last year, when I took over at the end of November, was that the last months of the year usually see a huge mobilisation of funds in most of the Member States when they are able to catch up."
"That means there are still three months left to ensure an adequate absorption of funds in Greece."
"All I can do is make the commitment that we will work hard with the authorities on this issue and on the basis of the figure I was presented with by the DG, my feeling is that the figure is well below the one mentioned in the question by the honourable Member."
"Nevertheless, at this stage I am reluctant to mention those figures because I believe that the Greek authorities and the Greeks who need the money will do their best to spend the money properly in the months to come."
"As you know, for the structural funds the amount which might be at risk is the amount allocated in 2003 because now the N+2 comes automatically at the end of this year, and within the 2003 allocation we have not only ERDF, but also Social Fund and EAGGF funding."
"It is not for me to impose rapid action on the Greek authorities, but insofar as we can impose and mobilise we are doing so."
"We are holding meetings at all levels and our missions are very often to Greece."
"Colleagues are working at a current operational level, but they are also very active in helping overcome any difficulties which have accumulated over years."
"Things like this do not happen overnight, but are usually the outcome of longer-term processes."
"We are trying to address the problems we have uncovered this year and help the Greeks."
"Madam President, Commissioner, is it not the case that the previous Greek Government amassed a huge debt potential, and that is why Greece now has problems fulfilling the Stability and Growth Pact?"
". I cannot say so with 100% certainty, but my feeling is that it is not so much co-financing problems as the national contribution to the funds which makes it difficult for the Greek projects to be finalised properly."
"There have probably been a series of flaws, but I am not prepared today to give more information on the real reasons for the problems."
"As I said, these are usually whole processes, but we have certainly not identified any one single factor responsible for the lack of financial means to co-finance the projects."
"– Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply and the spirit of your reply."
"Nonetheless, I should like to ask you: can you tell me, on the basis of requests for payment so far, what the total take-up rate is for the Greek Community Support Framework?"
"Similarly, you replied to me a few days ago in writing, saying that you were expecting Greek proposals on an interim review of the overall programme by the end of September."
"Have you received them?"
"Thirdly, following your trip to Greece, when do you estimate that the cooperation of the Commission with the Greek authorities on the review of the Community Support Framework will be completed?"
". I am not sure whether I heard all the questions, but normally if we receive the project proposals by the end of October we should safely be able to allocate the funds towards the end of the year."
"Therefore, there is still some time to go, which is why I am saying that it is too early to judge today which – if any – funds would probably not be taken up, especially since it is always possible that there may be an excellent project that will consume the rest of the 2003 allocations before the end of this year."
"Let me tell you that there is certainly no lack of willingness to cooperate with the Commission."
"As you may remember, in the first half of the year we managed to resolve an enormously difficult problem."
"We managed to find a solution, we managed to finalise negotiations that were extremely difficult and painful for both sides."
"However, the commitment on both sides was strong enough to resolve the problem, which was of a historical nature. Today we are working more on a current basis, but all the necessary efforts are being made on both sides and that makes me feel optimistic that we will resolve this problem."
"I cannot make any commitments on behalf of the Greek Government, however; I can only offer the help that we are offering."
"Is it true that, because of reductions in the budget originally planned for the period from 2007 to 2013, the Commission will be forced to cut back on the amounts initially intended for certain aid instruments?"
"If so, which ones?"
"There has been mention of the budget for 2007-13."
"As the honourable Member will be aware, this is the subject of an interinstitutional agreement and also the subject of negotiations between the three institutions on the basis of a proposal tabled by the Commission."
"The Commission is involved in negotiations but nonetheless it defends its own proposal, if I may use that verb."
"The Commission has no power when it comes to deciding how a potential reduction of the total budget amount is to be distributed, and it cannot take decisions on how budget cuts are to be spread across the individual headings within the framework of cohesion policy."
"Each global cut of this nature leads to adjustments of components of the whole budget too."
"I can, however, state that in June the Luxembourg Presidency proposed a budget for cohesion policy that was 10% less than the Commission’s proposal."
"The proposal envisaged a disproportionate impact on the individual objectives of cohesion policy."
"Objective I, involving the poorest regions, suffered a 6% cut."
"Objective II, intended to help create more competitive regions and provide new jobs, suffered a budget cut of about 18%."
"The most drastic cuts concerned Objective III, which relates to European territorial cooperation, that is, to cohesion."
"For Objective III the cuts amounted to 50%."
"I am referring to a reduction in relation to the Commission’s proposal."
"In principle this would have a disproportionate impact on the so-called old and new Member States, as 80% of the cuts would affect the 15 older Member States and the remaining 20% would affect the countries that have recently acceded to the Union."
"This is all I can say about the Commission’s involvement in decisions concerning budget cuts."
"I am taking the floor to prove that Greek Members are not the only ones to attempt to debate with the Commissioner."
"Thank you for your response, Commissioner Hübner."
"It was competent, detailed and to the point."
"In my question I tried to convey the concerns felt by many Members as to how regional policy will fare in the framework of the new budget."
"I shall leave it at that, President, to prove to you that there are some male Members of this House who are capable of finishing on time so you do not need to resort to the ghastly device you have before you."
". There was no further question there for me to respond to."
"Commissioner, will you look at the speech made yesterday by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in which he lauded various achievements over recent years in developing parts of the United Kingdom?"
"The one thing common to all the examples he gave was that they had all been part-financed by the European Regional Development Fund."
"In that context, will you use that information in your negotiations with the Council to try to push up the amount of money available in the 2007-2013 financial perspective?"
". Thank you for that information."
"In this context I should like to say two things."
"Firstly, the UK is a source of best practices in Europe when it comes to regional policy and the way funds are used."
"I have visited many science and business parks."
"You have wonderful partnerships at local level and achieve unbelievably good results, very often from a tiny catalytic contribution coming from the Structural Funds."
"Wherever you go – not only in Scotland, Wales or Cornwall, but also in other regions of the UK – you can find excellent examples of this type of best practice."
"We are also using the UK experience to help us to become more innovative in terms of financial engineering, and the British experience will also be widely used for the events which we will have with the British next month on financial engineering."
"Secondly, we all need a decision on the budget, but it should be appreciated that in the meantime we can work together with the British on all other avenues – regulations, programming and also on those innovative proposals for initiatives for the future of the funds."
"However, it would be good to have the decision on the budget under the British Presidency."
"Commissioner, your colleague Commissioner Grybauskaitė stated publicly that if the EU fails to reach an agreement on the financial perspective this year during the British Presidency, then the new Member States of the EU would be unable to receive the full level of assistance from the structural and cohesion funds as planned."
"Do you agree with that prediction?"
". It is no secret that this policy needs time to be launched."
"We estimate that from the moment the decision on the budget is made we will need about 18 months to launch the new generation of cohesion programmes and projects."
"Looking at it from this point of view, now is really the last moment for the decision to be made on the budget, as we are already short of time."
"That is absolutely clear."
"The problem is that once the decision is made and we complete all the other necessary procedures, then we have to negotiate the programmes – the national framework and the operational programmes – and then the Member States have to prepare themselves for the launch of the programmes and projects."
"If we start the projects in January 2007 – which is now quite unlikely – then there is less time to absorb the money, so the amount of money will just depend on the decision, whenever it is made."
"The decision will give the money, but how much time we will have to absorb the money is the worrying factor."
"If the perspective is shortened because of the delayed decision on the Financial Perspective, then the Member States and regions – old and new – will have less time and there is a risk that some money will be lost."
"It is in the case of this policy that the risk is highest."
"Questions Nos 45 and 46 will be answered in writing(1)."
"In 2004, the Commission awarded a contract to the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law (ISDC) for a study on gambling services in the internal market."
"The ISDC has sub-contracted out part of that study to a UK university – the Centre for the Study of Gambling (Manchester) – which apparently receives funding from bookmakers."
"There are also doubts over the independence of the ISDC itself, the financial viability of which depends on orders placed by those involved in the gambling sector."
"This economic connection would seem to constitute a de facto conflict of interest that could cast doubt on the validity of the report’s conclusions."
"In view of the indisputable impact that the study will have on the rules governing the gambling sector in the future, what steps does the Commission intend to take to ensure that the study is objective, and what guarantees to that effect can it give to all those involved in the gambling sector in Europe?"
". I am satisfied that there is no conflict of interest in relation to the study that the Commission has commissioned."
"I am satisfied with the independence and integrity of the work of the contractor, the Swiss Institute, and the sub-contractor, the Centre for the Study of Gambling at Salford University."
"The relationship with contributing companies to which the honourable Member refers is one that is common to university departments throughout the world."
"I am assured that donations from contributing companies, whether they be bookmakers or national lotteries, are unconditional donations."
"I am satisfied with the declaration of the absence of conflict of interest given to the Commission."
"I can assure the honourable Member that my services will give the fullest attention to how this study is carried out and will ensure that the contractor fully meets the award criteria set out in the tender specifications."
"The honourable Member refers to, and I quote, 'the indisputable impact that the study will have on the rules governing the gambling sector in the future'."
"Firstly I would like to remind the honourable Member that the study, which is looking at a wide variety of gambling services, will report factually on the various laws applicable in the Member States and on economic aspects."
"This is a fact-finding exercise and the contractor will not advise the Commission on its future policy options."
"Finally, I can assure the honourable Member that I will not be taking any policy decisions purely on the basis of this study."
"The study will assist us all in gaining a better understanding of the issues involved, but it is my intention to consult fully before taking any decision."
"The report of the contractor will be given to all interested parties and will be published on the Commission's website."
"In addition, the contractor's findings will be the subject of a public hearing, which is scheduled to take place in early November, at which the views of the interested parties, including the honourable Member, will be most welcome."
"Commissioner, thank you for your very precise answer."
"I would simply like to stress that you have not denied the facts contained in my question and that it is precisely those facts that are particularly concerning."
"Even if the Swiss Institute for Comparative Law’s study is just a preliminary study on all systems, it is quite clear that contracting all the economic aspects to a university centre with companies such as Stanley Leisure, Gala Group, London Clubs International or the Camelot Group on its administrative board is nevertheless, in my opinion, far from being as objective as it should be."
". I do not agree with the honourable Member."
"It is quite common for universities and centres of excellence to have funding from particular bodies."
"There is no conflict of interest when that particular university carries out a study."
"I do not accept that it is any different in this case."
"The contractor has given various assurances."
"I would point out to the honourable Member that the Camelot Group, which runs the UK National Lottery, is also listed as a sponsor."
"So Salford is sponsored by both a private sector operator and an operator with a state monopoly."
"Therefore I do not accept that they are in any way conflicting."
"This is going to be a factual study; it will help the Commission in its deliberations; it will be put on the website; there will be a hearing in November to which all interested parties will be invited, including the honourable Member."
"We will then reach our final decisions thereafter."
"This is a fact-finding exercise."
"Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the robustness of your response."
"I wonder if you would agree with me that the Centre for the Study of Gambling in Manchester is a reputable academic institution that takes no moral position on gambling, either for or against."
"It simply looks at the psychological roots of gambling and its economic and social impact, and does so in an independent and academic fashion."
". On the basis of the information available to me I can agree with the honourable Member and, until it is proved otherwise, this particular institute has the highest reputation."
"In July I tabled a question to the Commission concerning the difficulties experienced by Slovenian gaming operators in advertising their activities in Austria."
"In its reply, the Commission stated that it would examine the Austrian law (amended in 2003) which bans foreign gaming operators from advertising in Austria, and would establish whether or not it is compatible with Community legislation."
"What has the Commission ascertained in the three months since I tabled that initial question?"
"May I remind the Commission that while Austria prohibits and prevents foreign gaming operators from advertising their business in Austria, no such ban applies to national operators."
"Austria is clearly protecting the economic interests of national providers and obstructing foreign tourism operators in the single European market."
"This is a breach of the fundamental principles of a free market, and in particular of Article 49 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which concerns the freedom to provide services."
"What does the Commission intend to do in this area to end such discrimination before Austria’s EU presidency begins on 1 January 2006?"
". In my previous reply to the honourable Member, I stated that the Commission is prepared to examine the legislation in question on the basis of more specific information."
"While the Commission has not received specific complaints regarding the Austrian legislation, I would remind the honourable Member of the study which has been commissioned to report on all the national rules applicable to the various forms of gambling services."
"This study is due to be completed by the end of this year and I expect it to include a legal and economic review to help us all better understand the complex issues involved and to inform us of the laws applicable in the Member States, including Austria."
"I repeat my invitation to the honourable Member to provide us with more details or practical examples of the problems Slovenian gaming operators have experienced in advertising their activities."
"Such information would assist the Commission in establishing whether infringement proceedings should be opened."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your comprehensive answer."
"We will be only too happy to provide you with concrete examples of discrimination whereby certain Austrian companies are refusing to run advertising for gaming establishments in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia, since they are forbidden from doing so by their national legislation."
"Material evidence of this exists, and we will notify you of all such evidence as soon as possible."
"Thank you for your cooperation."
". I thank the honourable Member for what he is going to do."
"I invite him to contact the Commission so that a meeting can be set up with him."
"Perhaps the matter could be further pursued then."
"That would be one way of proceeding."
"Will the European Commission address the issue of the lack of consumer protection in the insurance/pension area?"
"The difficulties faced by thousands of EU citizens who invested in Equitable Life, only to find their pension greatly reduced, is a clear example of a failure of the EU to protect its citizens."
"With moves to open up banking across borders, how does the European Commission intend to protect its citizens/consumers, given the experience with Equitable Life?"
"And where problems arise, who will pay compensation to injured parties?"
"This is particularly important in light of efforts to reach agreement on and subsequently implement the proposed Services Directive (2004/0001 (COD)), where there are concerns about the country-of-origin principle and consumer protection."
". The Commission has the greatest sympathy for the many thousands of policy-holders and pensioners who have suffered severe financial loss as a result of the serious problems encountered by the Equitable Life insurance company."
"The Commission has no direct role in the supervision of individual insurance undertakings."
"That is the responsibility of each Member State and is, in practice, carried out by the supervisory authorities appointed for that purpose."
"The United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, recognising certain weaknesses in the former regime and responding to criticisms in the Penrose report, has launched a major reform of the regulation of life insurance undertakings."
"In part this reflects the lessons learned from the Equitable Life affair."
"As regards the payment of compensation where national supervision has failed, redress can only be sought before the national courts of the Member State in question."
"With respect to the Community regime for the insurance and pension sector, the Commission is currently working on the Solvency II project, the aim of which is to achieve over time a more harmonised risk-based system for the supervision and prudential regulation of all insurance undertakings across the European Union."
"The Commission is also continuing its exploratory work with the Member States on insurance guarantee schemes that could deal with situations where an insurance undertaking fails and is unable to meet its commitments to policy-holders and beneficiaries."
"It should be noted, however, that Equitable Life did not enter into liquidation and continues to operate as an authorised insurance undertaking, albeit one that is closed to new business."
"As far as the banking sector is concerned, the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive already obliges Member States to set up schemes which offer a minimum guarantee level of EUR 20 000 to depositors, although the threshold is higher in a number of Member States."
"The Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive is in the process of being reviewed in order to ensure that it is still in line with market developments."
"Concerning the proposal for a directive on services in the internal market, the Commission would like to recall that financial services are excluded from the scope of application of the services proposal."
"Furthermore, it should be noted that the services proposal includes provisions strengthening consumer protection. In particular, Article 27 requires Member States to ensure that providers whose services present a direct and particular risk to the health and safety of the recipient or a third person, or to the financial security of the recipient, would be obliged to take out professional indemnity insurance."
"More than one million Europeans, including over 15 000 non-UK residents and many vulnerable pensioners suffered real losses totalling EUR 5 billion to their prudently built-up retirement savings in 2001, allegedly due to what has been termed 'serial UK regulatory failure' and not due to falls in the stock market."
"The Commission has claimed that it is unnecessary for it to investigate the UK's national implementation since it finds that the UK is compliant today."
"This does nothing to redress the issue."
"Will the Commissioner investigate the case thoroughly with a view to instigating Court of Justice proceedings against the UK in this case?"
". There is long-established European Court of Justice jurisprudence in this area."
"The situation is as I outlined previously in response to a question regarding another insurance undertaking in the United Kingdom."
"The Commission is not in a position to pursue the matter in the way that the honourable Member and other Members of the House would like it to, because it is not the way the Commission can do things."
"The European Court of Justice only finds in relation to the way a directive has been transposed and the situation as it is at the present time."
"It is for policy-holders who have been affected by any change to pursue those issues through their own national courts."
"I have given this reply in response to previous questions in this generally related area and that remains the position."
"I thank you for your reply, Commissioner, but can you tell me how one is meant to have confidence in the single market if Equitable Life can get away with treating ordinary people in this way?"
"This was not due to a fall in the stock market but to serial failure in regulation."
"That is the allegation that has been made."
"How can people across Europe be asked to take a single market seriously if the Commission washes its hands in this way?"
". Irrespective of where my sympathies might lie in this area, the role of the Commission is to ensure that the United Kingdom is currently in conformity with the relevant EU legislation."
"The Commission cannot make any pronouncement on the content and application of the former regulation regime which has been replaced."
"The Commission has consistently acted in full conformity with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice on the role and purpose of infringement proceedings."
"The objective of such proceedings under EU law is to establish or restore the compatibility of existing national law with EU law, and not to rule on the possible past incompatibility of a national law, which has since been amended or replaced."
"That is the established jurisprudence on those issues and remains the situation."
"Since we are behind schedule, I shall have to stop the discussion of this topic here, and so Questions Nos 50 to 53 will be answered in writing(2)."
"Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92(3) provides for the protection of foodstuffs the quality of which is attributable to their specific geographical origin."
"The Czech Republic is seeking to have such protection of designation of origin applied to the product known as 'Karlovarske oplatky' (Karlsbader Oblaten – Karlsbad Wafers)."
"Karlsbad Wafers have been produced for some 200 years now on the basis of old family recipes, and they gained their worldwide reputation during the Golden Age of the Bohemian spa resort of Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary)."
"Until 1945, they were principally produced in what was known as the 'Spa Triangle' (Karlsbad – Marienbad – Franzensbad) – the majority of the inhabitants of which were German – and in Austria as well."
"After the end of the Second World War, large numbers of the German-speaking population were expelled from Czechoslovakia, and many of the old-established bakers from Karlsbad and other parts of the Spa Triangle moved to other countries, including Germany and Austria, and used their know-how to start up production of Karlsbad Wafers in their new homelands."
"Is the Commission aware of this situation, and how will it take it into account when it assesses the Czech application for protection of designation of origin?"
". The Commission can confirm to the honourable Member that it has received an application from the Czech Republic to register 'Karlovarske oplatky' as a protected destination of origin according to Council Regulation (EC) No 2081/92."
"This application is under examination by the Commission under the terms of the regulation."
"At this stage the Commission cannot take into account any information or material from third parties that is not contained in the application itself."
"If the Commission concludes that the application meets the requirements for registration, the name and a summary of the specification will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union."
"This allows any party with a legitimate interest to lodge an objection to the registration with their Member State."
"Any Member State may object to the registration within six months of publication, following which the Commission will invite the authorities of the Member States concerned to discuss the issue and seek agreement on the dossier."
"However, if the Commission concludes in its initial examination that the application does not meet the terms of the regulation, it will take a formal decision not to publish the application."
"Therefore, the strict answer to the honourable Member's question is that at the initial stage the Commission will only take into account matters contained in the application."
"However, if the Commission decides to publish the application there will be an opportunity for the producers referred to by the honourable Member to object to the registration."
"Commissioner, I do think that the Commission should also consider information from Parliament."
"Karlsbad Wafers were produced and sold in Karlsbad and Marienbad."
"They were invented at the Tepl monastery."
"They were being produced and sold worldwide back in the 19th and 20th centuries, and nowadays the best Karlsbad Wafers in the world are produced in Dillingen an der Donau by a company called Wetzel."
"Take a look at me; you can tell that I know a thing or two about food, and I can confirm that they are the best Karlsbad Wafers."
"I would therefore implore you to examine whether it is really possible to narrow down geographically a designation that is so international and European in nature."
"Our European culture would be poorer as a result."
". In the circumstances I had expected to be able to sample these extremely delicious waffles, but that might be for another occasion."
"I can only repeat that if the Commission decides to publish the application, there is a possibility for the different Member States to go into the matter within a fixed period."
"If that should be the outcome, then you have that possibility."
"I am quite sure that this will be followed up later on."
"I can provide confirmation from across the group divide that those wafers are indeed very good."
"Perhaps Mr Posselt should bring one along for the Commissioner."
"By letter of 19 October 2004, the Czech Republic applied for European designation protection to be granted for the product 'pravé olomoucke tvarůžky' ('genuine Olmützer Quargel') under Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92(4) ('designations of origin' regulation)."
"Olmützer Quargel is an acid curd cheese which originated in Austrian Moravia (cf."
"'Handbuch der Käse', Dr Heinrich Mair-Waldburg (ed.)) and has been produced in Austria since about the end of the 19th century."
"In Germany too, for instance, Olmützer Quargel has been produced, and marketed under that designation, since at least 1945, however."
"As a result of the geopolitical changes after World War II, a large number of German-speaking cheesemakers emigrated from Czechoslovakia, as it then was, to Austria, further expanding production of 'Olmützer Quargel' there on the basis of the know-how they brought with them."
"Designation protection for the product made in the Czech Republic would make it impossible to continue marketing the Olmützer Quargel traditionally made in Austria."
"What scope does the Commission think there is for taking that into account as part of the protection arrangements under Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92?"
". The Commission can confirm to the honourable Member that it has received an application from the Czech Republic to register 'pravé olomoucke tvarůžky' as a protected geographical indication."
"As for what to do, whether the Commission takes a decision to follow up these ideas, or whether to just leave it as it is, the explanation is exactly the same, and to save time at this late stage I would simply suggest that there is a possibility to come back to this."
"Madam President, the Commissioner herself has said that the application by the Czech Republic concerns ‘genuine Olmützer Quargel’."
"In my opinion, this is accurate."
"This would also make it clear – particularly as ‘Olmützer Quargel’ is produced in other Member States, too, of course – that this is simply a generic designation."
"This would not pose any problems from the point of view of Austria or Germany, the countries in which these producers from the former Czechoslovakia have settled, as the relevant distinction would be rendered by the term ‘genuine’ Olmützer Quargel."
". I am quite aware of the reasons why this is produced outside the original triangle, but I can only recommend that you try to use the possibilities available in the legislation if this should not turn out as you wish it to in the end."
"On 11 May 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the simplification of the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables, in which it urges the Commission to strengthen support for producer organisations and introduce import quotas for the soft fruit market."
"This came after MEPs had repeatedly addressed the matter within the Committee on Agriculture and in letters to Commissioner Fischer Boel."
"Unfortunately, there has as yet been no firm response from the Commission with regard to soft fruits."
"In Poland, the situation in this market has been disastrous in 2005."
"The buying-in price of strawberries, raspberries and currants has been considerably lower than production costs for the second year running."
"Does the Commission intend to apply the solutions suggested by Parliament in its resolution of 11 May in time for the 2006 harvest?"
". The Commission is aware that the Polish soft fruit sector has had major problems in the last two years, owing to the low prices of several of the products in question."
"Following the Presidency's conclusions concerning the simplification of the common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables in November 2004, the Commission started several months ago to carry out an analysis of the Community market for soft fruit intended for processing, with a view to making appropriate proposals to address the specific problems."
"As part of those investigations, missions were organised to several Member States."
"In Poland, these took place in April and July."
"The work will be completed by the end of the year and will be published by the Commission at the beginning of 2006."
"Obviously, it will be necessary to await the conclusions of this work before starting discussions on any possible measures."
"In addition, at Poland's request, the Commission has initiated a safeguard investigation concerning the import of frozen strawberries."
"The investigation is ongoing and no conclusion has been drawn at this stage."
"Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking the Commission and you personally for taking such an interest in this problem, which is a very serious one for Poland."
"My main concern is the length of the decision-making process."
"We first drew attention to this problem back in 2004."
"Unfortunately, another year has gone by and things got worse rather than better in 2005."
"I have a question for you, Commissioner. Will it be possible to resolve this problem before the start of the 2006 harvest?"
". Work on the report started back in April 2005 and since then investigations have been carried out in the major countries concerned: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland and the United Kingdom."
"Two missions to Poland were undertaken during the harvest period."
"The report is being prepared on the basis of the information collected during these missions, together with statistical data."
"It will cover in detail the four major European sub-sectors: strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and cherries for processing."
"Possible measures will be included in the Commission communication on the proposal for reform of the fruit and vegetable sector, scheduled to be discussed in the second part of 2006."
"According to recent reports, a substantial proportion of European farm subsidies is paid not to small farmers but to wealthy large land-owners, mostly of aristocratic origin."
"While hundreds of farmers have been receiving an average of less than € 100 in European subsidies, the landed gentry and food companies have made millions at the expense of the European tax-payer."
"A few examples: the sugar company Tate [amp] Lyle – € 170 m; the Dutch Minister of Agriculture, Cees Veerman – € 400 m;"
"Is the Commission aware of this?"
"How does it explain this improper use of European farm subsidies?"
". Thank you, because it is very nice to know where the question is coming from."
"The Commission forwarded to the European Parliament indicative information on the breakdown of CAP direct payments by Member State, the size of payments, and types of farms in 2000 and 2001."
"It can be seen from those data that there are great disparities in the size of payments for farmers in many of our Member States."
"Since aid applications are made by the farmer, defined as a person whose holding is situated within Community territory and who exercises an agricultural activity, the Commission does not receive data concerning land ownership or the aristocratic status of the beneficiary."
"In any case, since it is bound to ensure the confidentiality of these individual data, the Commission is not in a position to make available or to publish the names of beneficiaries of aid from the EAGGF Guarantee Section."
"The reason for the variation in distribution of the direct payments is connected with historical production."
"Since the 1992 CAP reform, the original price support policy has been replaced by a policy aiming at greater competitiveness."
"The shifts in policy have been achieved by the gradual reduction of the EU support prices and compensation for farmers for the consequent revenue loss in the form of direct payments."
"Owing to the fact that those direct payments were first introduced by coupling them mainly to production factors through per hectare payments and reference yields in the arable sector, and to headage in the livestock sector, those farmers with larger farms or greater livestock numbers received more compensation in the form of direct payments."
"During the debates held on all the different changes to the CAP in the 1992 reform and Agenda 2000, and again in the discussions on CAP reform in 2003, the Commission actually proposed a so-called capping of the direct payments to farmers and, as far as I remember, the latest discussions on this issue back in 2003 proposed a cap of EUR 300 000 for each beneficiary."
"At the end of the day, however, the Council and the Member States rejected this proposal and it is therefore not part of the current CAP reform."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for her response."
"I understand very well that the Commission cannot make data available concerning beneficiaries, but I think it is still important, in the interest of all of us, that we should insist on that information being publicised."
"It will make policy so much more transparent and make the common agricultural policy so much easier to defend."
"Secondly, I would like to say to the Commissioner that, following in the UK’s footsteps, the Netherlands has now also publicised the data."
"These data confirm that most of the European agricultural subsidies end up where they should not, namely in the hands of large industrial companies such as Nestlé and Heineken."
"How much longer can the Commission tolerate this?"
". When the figures are published, both the direct payment to the farmer and the export refunds to big companies are of course part of these figures."
"You are quite right that it is not in my hands to publish these figures, because they are not the Commission's figures."
"That is the reason."
"Of course I have noticed that certain Member States have decided to publish these figures, among others the countries you named and the country I know best."
"We are preparing our website, the DG Agriculture website, to provide a link to the different Member States."
"That is the only way that we can put 'soft' pressure on the Member States to publish these figures."
"Commissioner, I have to say that I find your answer utterly unsatisfactory."
"For the period between 2005 and 2009, the Commission made transparency into one of its strategic objectives."
"Commissioner Kallas stated very clearly in two speeches, one in Nottingham and one in Berlin, that money that is allocated via agriculture, among others, is the taxpayers’ money and that citizens ought to know where it ends up."
"Mr Kallas states quite explicitly that Member States must make information concerning beneficiaries of European funds available to the public, so I see a contradiction between your statement here and what was said by your fellow-Commissioner Mr Kallas."
"I would like to know, Commissioner, whether you will help ensure that Member States are required to make information of this kind available to the public, in accordance with Mr Kallas’ intention."
". I have always been in favour of transparency."
"That is why we have been looking into ways of how to make Member States publish these figures."
"At present I am not in a position to do that, but I am working in close cooperation with my colleague, Commissioner Kallas, to see what can be done."
"Naturally, we cannot break the rules or breach legislation."
"That would cause huge problems."
"But we are looking into this matter and we are trying, via the link to our website, to show everyone that we want to see the Member States publish these figures."
"Madam President, Commissioner, does it not more closely reflect reality to say that there are both large and small farms, which developed by tradition?"
"Is it not the case that these large farms are the same rural businesses that employ a very large workforce?"
"I should just like to point out that agriculture in my home Member State is structured on a small scale, yet, back in 1999, Austria was in favour of this modulation, this phasing-in schedule."
"Unfortunately, it did not win through, however, as first Germany and then the United Kingdom opposed it."
". When we last had discussions on trying to find a compromise political agreement on the CAP reform in 2003, there were various discussions on how to target the payments to different types."
"Two ideas were put forward."
"One of them was accepted by the Council and that was the idea of taking all the smaller farms out of the system – those receiving less than EUR 5 000 with this franchise."
"They do not contribute to the modulation."
"When we have to reduce a direct payment to the farmers afterwards because we hit the ceiling of the Brussels Agreement, these smaller enterprises will not be hit."
"We have taken into consideration the possibility of not targeting the smaller farms when we talk about reducing the direct payment."
"Questions Nos 58 to 96 will be answered in writing(5)."
"Madam President, on a point of order, did you expend the full 20 minutes on oral questions to Commissioner Fischer Boel?"
"Yes, we did."
"We have already overrun by several minutes, and I should like to give our interpreters, too, the chance to have a break."
"That is why I announced a short while ago that we were unable to continue dealing with a question."
"I had hoped that you had heard me."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the adoption of the first two railway packages in 2001 and 2004, the Commission proposed a further set of legislative measures on 3 March 2004, collectively known as the third railway package."
"The objective of this third package is to supplement the regulatory framework for the railways at European level, so as to make progress on interoperability and to achieve greater integration of the market in passenger services, while at the same time safeguarding passenger rights."
"The measures also seek to improve the often poor standards of freight services."
"These proposals are in line with the objectives set in the 2001 White Paper on transport policy."
"At that time, we had clearly stated that there was a need to modernise the way in which rail services were organised so as to stop them becoming any more unpopular and declining further, and to generate momentum for quality rail transport."
"The legislative texts that we are examining today are also justified by the fact that transport services play a key role in the economic growth of our continent."
"The strategy launched in Lisbon recognised their significance in this respect."
"I now turn, Mr President, to the measures that we are recommending in more detail: firstly, a proposal for a directive on the certification of train crews operating locomotives and trains."
"Mr Savary is the rapporteur."
"With your permission, I would recall simply that the Commission undertook to table this text during the negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council on the second railway package."
"Drafted in consultation with the sector and the social partners, this new text provides for a mechanism enabling competences and responsibilities to be better defined with regard to the training, assessment and recognition of the qualifications of train drivers and train crews with responsibility for safety."
"A driver will have to hold an individual licence attesting to his general abilities, which will be valid throughout the Community."
"This licence will have to be supplemented by a certificate issued by the railway undertaking employing him."
"This undertaking will give details of the training that he has received relating specifically to the line travelled, the rolling stock used and the operational and safety procedures followed."
"That is the first proposal for a directive."
"The second proposal seeks to amend the current directive on opening up the market in rail transport."
"Mr Jarzembowski is the rapporteur."
"I would remind you that it concerns opening up the market in international passenger services to competition."
"This proposal is a direct response to a request made by Parliament to the Commission at the conciliation on the second railway package, when it expressed a desire to be consulted on specific proposals on opening up the market in passenger rail transport services."
"Specifically, the Commission is proposing that, from 1 January 2010, those railway undertakings possessing a licence and the necessary safety certificate may operate international services throughout the Community."
"Facilitating new commercial initiatives will help to breathe new life into this sector."
"In order to create realistic economic conditions for the development of these services, the Commission believes that cabotage should also be permitted."
"The proposal therefore provides for the possibility of passengers being picked up and set down all along an international route, including between two stations in the same Member State, while at the same time safeguarding the balance of public-service contracts."
"I am particularly anxious that it should dovetail properly with the revised proposal for a regulation on public transport services that the Commission adopted in June 2005."
"I turn now to the third part of the package: the proposal on passengers’ rights and obligations, which supplements the proposal to open up the market in passenger transport services."
"Before going into the details of this proposal, I would recall that hitherto the on passenger protection has been limited to air transport."
"When it set out its objectives in the White Paper, the Commission wanted to put the user at the heart of all modes of transport."
"It therefore considered it necessary to extend the rights of rail passengers as a way of counterbalancing its policy of market opening."
"The protection of rail passengers is a not insignificant instrument in our bid to relaunch and revitalise the rail sector."
"The report concerned is by Mr Sterckx."
"I will confine myself to mentioning a number of the proposal’s key points, starting with free and non-discriminatory assistance to passengers with reduced mobility, which will guarantee that trains are accessible."
"Passengers with reduced mobility have said that they would like transport services to be more easily accessible, so that they could use them without assistance."
"In cases when services are not sufficiently accessible, the railway undertaking and the station manager will be obliged to provide appropriate assistance if requested to do so."
"The second component of our third proposal is the possibility for international passengers to obtain information about the main destinations in Europe and to buy direct tickets."
"Thus, passengers can request one direct ticket when they have to cross the borders of several Member States."
"In particular, the Commission is asking for it to be made possible to purchase integrated tickets for destinations outside the network of the railway undertaking issuing the ticket."
"It should, for example, be possible to purchase a ticket to travel from Lyon, in France, to Graz, in Austria."
"In a letter recently sent to the Commission, a passenger complains of a local operator refusing to issue him with a ticket of this kind."
"The third component of the proposal is a modern system of civil liability, comparable to that in other transport sectors and based on a system of compulsory insurance."
"The Commission believes that civil liability in the case of accidents should cover as many accidents as possible and that it should be accompanied by obligatory insurance, the only way to guarantee that proper compensation will be provided for all of the damages suffered by the passenger."
"The final component is immediate assistance in the case of delays, including a compensation and indemnification system."
"Passengers holding tickets that are sometimes very expensive should not have to suffer prolonged delays or service cancellations without any information from the service provider or any support from the railway undertaking."
"A final objective of the third railway package is to regulate freight services and to improve the quality of freight transport."
"Mr Zīle is the rapporteur for this fourth proposal."
"It seeks to have minimal clauses inserted into contracts between railway companies and their customers, something which is already deemed to be good practice in the sector."
"The precise content of the undertakings on quality is left to the contracting parties to determine."
"The proposed text seeks to have quality considerations taken into account systematically, as improving the quality of rail freight transport is essential if the sector is to maintain the momentum that it seems to be gathering."
"In conclusion, I should like to address a key issue about the reading of the third railway package."
"As for previous legislative proposals in the railway sector, the notion of ‘package’ is very important for the Commission."
"It would be regrettable to endanger the success of the third package by unravelling it and separating its component parts."
"I would therefore like to stress our support for the position of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which is recommending preserving the logic of the package."
"The Commission can also endorse the proposal made by your Transport Committee to coordinate the reading of the railway package with that of the new proposal for a regulation on public-service obligations."
"It is obviously desirable to ensure that the two proposals are mutually complementary, which pleads in favour of such a coordinated reading."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank your rapporteurs, who have examined our proposals so thoroughly."
"It goes without saying that I will be listening very carefully to what they, and all of the speakers, have to say during the course of this debate. I am convinced that this third railway package will enable us to achieve a genuinely better balanced use of the various modes of transport in Europe."
"We all know – and the explosion in oil prices is a reminder if we needed one – that we need to be able to identify alternatives, in particular for long-distance traffic: alternatives such as transport by rail, river and sea."
"The fact remains that rail transport needs to achieve its full potential in a Europe where it has the capacity, because it is changing, to become an extremely valuable trading and transport tool for all of the people of Europe."
"That is why I attach a great deal of importance to this debate, Mr President, and I should like to thank Parliament in advance for its active participation, which I value so highly."
"Thank you, Mr Barrot."
"As you said, this is a very important debate."
"I should like to remind the House of the famous remark made by the former British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, in about 1945."
"He said: 'My idea of Europe is to go down to Victoria Station in London and buy a ticket to anywhere I damn well like'."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, fellow sufferers, it is once again our good fortune to be taking part in such an important debate at 9 p.m., alone in our cosy circle of rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"We should not let this annoy us too much, however, but rather address ourselves to the issue."
"I believe that the Vice-President has allies among us in favour of the package remaining a package, apart from a lone French voice."
"We do know, of course, that French voices are sometimes particularly important."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the majority wishes to, and will, keep the package intact."
"That is what we shall do tomorrow, and not just as an end in itself."
"Even I, as a lawyer, shall not put forward the argument that, almost 13 years after completion of the internal market, we really should set about completing the internal market in passenger transport."
"This argument is a good one for lawyers, but we shall refrain from making it."
"The intention with the third package is to make long-distance and regional transport more reliable and customer-friendly."
"That is our goal."
"We want there to be competition, we want better services for the benefit of passengers."
"Those are our objectives."
"That is why the issues of opening up national railway networks on a non-discriminatory basis for use by all railway undertakings, uniform passengers’ rights throughout the EU and the use of the same train drivers belong together."
"We do not want a situation in which, despite now having locomotives that can cross borders, the train still has to stop at the border to change drivers – only to find that the new driver is on holiday or off sick, and the train remains at a standstill."
"The aim is not only for people to be able to buy a ticket to anywhere in Europe, but also for them to arrive there quickly."
"This is why we need the third railway package."
"Admittedly there were discussions in my group at first, but then we, too, fell in with the line of thought of dispensing with regulations on quality requirements or freight traffic."
"Since we are opening up the networks for cross-border transport as of 1 January 2006 and for domestic freight traffic as of 1 January 2007, we hope that competition will have indeed developed in two or three years’ time, and that we shall not then need legislation on quality requirements."
"Competition can already be seen in traffic in the Alpine region, and customers have the choice between the services of two different alliances of railway undertakings."
"This is why I do not believe that we need any legislation on quality requirements; the market will regulate this."
"I should now like to introduce several aspects of my report."
"I do not believe that it is always necessary to break new ground; instead, when it comes to the development of railway undertakings, we should go back to what Parliament decided at second reading of the second railway package."
"At that time, we decided, by an overwhelming majority, to open up the networks not only for cross-border, but also for domestic rail transport as of 1 January 2008."
"That was what we called for two years ago; why should we now turn back, I ask myself."
"To give all the parties involved more time, however, the Committee is proposing that the opening-up be staggered: 1 January 2008 for cross-border rail transport, but 1 January 2012 for domestic rail transport."
"We all know that, when it comes to negotiations with the Council, 2012 can become 2013 or something else entirely."
"If, however, Parliament called for all rail networks to be opened up as of 2008 two years ago, it must stay on this course."
"I hope that the Vice-President comes round to Parliament’s way of thinking and decides to regulate not only cross-border transport, but also transport throughout the internal market."
"After all, we have to make headway sooner or later."
"To be frank, I do not wish to see a fourth, fifth or sixth railway package."
"We should draw a line under it and decide on liberalisation, the opening-up of the networks, customer orientation and competition with this package."
"Permit me to draw the House’s attention to just two more things. We already have a brake for the opening-up of the networks, and in particular for opening them up for domestic rail transport."
"The reason is that we share the Commission’s view that it should not be compulsory to open up the networks if this would create difficulties for a regional passenger service, by which we mean not just possible difficulties, but an actual threat to its economic viability."
"Naturally, it is not our intention for this opening-up of networks to endanger regional transport."
"I should like to say to my Dutch fellow-Members that there is no need to worry."
"I do believe that the brake, which you yourselves proposed for cross-border transport, but which is even more important for domestic transport, will enable us to prevent the collapse of domestic regional transport, because there is no obligation to open up the networks in this case."
"Our fellow-Members from smaller countries can put aside their reservations in this regard."
"I do not wish to go into detail on our desire to amend Directive 2001/14/EC in order to give high-speed railway lines a better chance of planning for the longer term."
"By way of conclusion, there is something else to which I should just like to draw your attention. Parliament – with the exception of individual Members right at the back – has always said that the package should remain intact, as the Commission proposed it."
"That is why we also put back the date for the introduction of this package in plenary."
"Once we have made our decision, the Council is free to take its own."
"The least positive experience has been with the Meijer report."
"Our first reading of this – following a Commission proposal on public transport in 2000 – was in November 2001."
"The Council has done nothing to date except to deliberately shelve this proposal."
"The Council is falling short in the performance of its duties; it lacks the courage to address this difficult issue."
"We have said, however, that these four parts belong together, and they also belong with the proposal on public transport."
"We have said that we are prepared to bring this issue to a definitive conclusion with a legislative resolution in plenary, as soon as the Council gives us a signal."
"The Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism informed us this afternoon that the British Transport Secretary, Mr Darling, has assured us that this package will be kept intact."
"For this reason, we, too, should take the leap tomorrow and not just vote on the amendments, but also on the legislative resolutions, so that tomorrow afternoon we are able to state our position on the third railway package, to state our opinion."
"I would appeal to the Council to keep its word, to leave the package intact, to make sound proposals, then we shall be able to make good progress."
"I hope that, at the Council meeting on 6 October, the British Presidency will actively represent the signal that we are going to give tomorrow, and speed up the work."
"Amid all the details, let us not forget that we are doing this not for the sake of liberalisation, or because we are self-opinionated; we are doing it in the interests of passengers, because we can see the increasing trend towards passengers taking their cars or using low-cost airlines for long-distance journeys rather than taking the train."
"In line with our general thinking regarding freight, however – that it must be taken off the roads and put onto the rails – our line of thinking must be to make passengers an offer that tempts them out of cars and aeroplanes and back onto trains."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank the chairman of our committee, Paolo Costa, and all of our colleagues, be they rapporteurs – one of whom has just spoken – shadow rapporteurs or coordinators, for the very intensive and quite remarkable work that they have done on behalf of the European Parliament."
"I listened carefully to Mr Jarzembowski, who mentioned a Frenchman who was, he said, hostile to the package."
"I do not know whom he meant."
"No doubt he knows this man."
"In any case I do not."
"That is why I have argued strongly that we should vote on all of the texts today and forward them to the Council."
"Parliament has done its work and the package is ready."
"We will forward it to the UK Presidency tomorrow and I hope moreover that the UK Presidency will make a decision, so that if possible – although we should perhaps not be too idealistic – this complicated dossier can be completed under Mr Blair’s Presidency."
"The package is moving forward: I simply wanted us to put it to the vote today and not defer the work that has been done by the European Parliament."
"There is no reason to do so, because there is at least one text that is rather urgent and that is the text on the licence for train drivers."
"This is not because it was the subject of fairly broad agreement in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, but quite simply because liberalisation is underway."
"The international rail freight market has been open since 15 March 2003 and we need this text today to ensure that drivers operating international rail transport services are properly trained."
"I would add in respect of my own report that it is quite exemplary and I hope that the message that we in Parliament send out tomorrow will be equally so."
"Why is it exemplary?"
"Firstly, because it sends out a social signal, when until now we have essentially sent out economic or liberalisation signals."
"I have always argued here that rail transport should be a matter for everyone, including railway workers, and I do not think that this initiative will be successful if those who work on the railways feel that the European rail system is no concern of theirs."
"We have set up a Railway Agency, in which we are going to involve the social partners; we need to ensure that the social partners feel that they have a stake in the investment that we are all making in the future of rail transport."
"That is why we need to take this text, which has been agreed by both sides of industry, by the employers and the unions – which is very rare at European level – and today enshrine it in legislation."
"It is an exercise – a fairly straightforward one at the end of the day, because the work has been done – that consists of transposing a historic, social agreement into substantive European law, an agreement that calls for others, perhaps one day collective agreements enabling railway workers to feel that they all have a stake in opening up rail networks."
"That is why I will take the liberty of asking for as broad an agreement as possible on my report tomorrow, a report to which the committee has made many improvements, which may appear trivial, but which are actually important."
"Firstly, we have extended it."
"We think that in the long term all workers on all of the networks should, if they so wish, have an international driver’s licence."
"Every national driver has a right to become an international driver if he so wishes."
"We also wanted to clarify the text."
"We have clearly stated the definitions of drivers and train crews, in the case of the latter referring to a forthcoming proposal from the Commission, to be based on work done by the Agency, which will be carried out openly and in consultation with stakeholders."
"We have also made the text more precise in terms of training, in terms of the benefits that each worker gains from his experience and in terms of how the training is financed, given that some drivers that have been trained by one railway undertaking may subsequently move to another."
"Finally, we have made the dates more consistent and have brought forward the date of transposition."
"That is the basic substance of the report that our committee is proposing to you."
"I should now like to make a few final comments on the other texts."
"I think that Mr Sterckx’s report on passenger rights is absolutely essential."
"There is no reason to establish passenger rights in air transport and not in rail transport."
"Moreover, given that there are significant disparities between the Member States and also problems with the system, in particular in my own country, I am pleased that Mr Sterckx is tabling a report along these lines and I hope that the opposition in the Council will be overcome."
"When it comes to Mr Zīle’s report, without wishing to offend the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job, I am of course more cautious, quite simply because the railway undertakings value the contractual relationship and goods are a great deal more heterogeneous than passengers."
"Transporting one kind of merchandise can be very different from transporting another."
"Finally I turn to Mr Jarzembowski’s report, and here I am personally more cautious."
"I voted in favour of liberalising the freight market because freight was not working."
"When it comes to passenger transport, it seems to me that this is all about a few large companies coveting the national networks."
"It is cabotage that troubles me more than anything else."
"We all know full well that in reality there is no market for services from Paris to Rome."
"However, there is a market between Paris and Lyon and between Lyon and Marseilles, and that is what the large companies are eyeing up."
"I am concerned about the small countries, countries of limited size, whose national lines are actually on international lines that might disappear tomorrow or be absorbed by large operators like SNCF or Deutsche Bahn."
"Moreover, that is precisely why these large companies are so interested."
"I should like, in conclusion, to say that, as I see it, if we think in terms of transport markets – and no one has denied this for the last ten years – it is road that wins."
"We have to think in terms of transport policy and the essential factor is not simply competition within the rail sector, which is the objective that we have been pursuing obsessively for years, but providing the conditions to enable there to be competition between road and the other modes of transport."
"Until we have settled this point rail will decline, as it is declining today for open freight."
"Mr President, I think that I too have been given an extra minute and a half by a fellow Member who cannot be here this evening, so I think that my speaking time has been extended to six and a half minutes, which I intend to use now if you would deduct these past ten seconds from it."
"Commissioner, I should like to thank the Commission for its proposal, for I regard all those railway packages, like the passengers’ rights proposal, as being an important element of the EU’s transport policy."
"If we want to establish an open European railway market, it is vital that the passengers should have minimum rights within that market if people are to gain, or retain, confidence in rail."
"I have to tell you, though, Commissioner, that Parliament, or at least the Committee on Transport and Tourism, has made some amendments to your proposal."
"While I am on the subject, I would like to thank all Members who have taken part in the debate, either as individuals or as groups, for all the amendments they have tabled –of which there were quite a few, with perhaps more to come as well – but it is thanks to those efforts, Commissioner, that we are now presenting a proposal that, to my mind, is even-handed and well-structured."
"There is a link between the area of application and the level of requirements."
"The Commission has opted for a small area of application, namely international rail traffic, and a strict package of requirements, while Parliament has slightly altered this balance, in that it opted for a large area of application, that is to say rights for all rail passengers, as is the case in aviation in fact, and has adapted the strict basic requirements to allow more room for manoeuvre for railway undertakings, regional authorities or local authorities."
"I would first like to say a few words about the requirements package."
"We remained faithful to the international agreements of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) as much as we could and made, with regard to information to travellers, some changes to the Commission proposal accordingly."
"I take the view that it is not necessary to provide all information to all travellers both prior to, and during, the journey."
"That would, in fact, lead to an unworkable level of red tape, involving, for example, A4-size tickets."
"There is no point in doing this, I do not think."
"I think that railway undertakings need to be encouraged to give the necessary information to the right passengers."
"I do not think it is right to force companies to provide information about the competition or other companies if that is against their wishes."
"If they can be prompted to join forces, so much the better, but I think that a company that wants to win over a customer cannot be forced to include possible competitors in its information policy."
"The same applies to tickets, except that in this case, a distinction needs to be drawn – and we make this quite clear – between a public service, where tickets have to be made available to a wide public, and commercial, specialist services, where, to my mind, far fewer resources can be used, such as the Internet only, which has happened in some cases, and which could bring the cost down."
"I also think that you cannot force competing companies to sell each other’s tickets."
"That is not done in aviation, so why should it be done in rail traffic?"
"I do think, though – and we have tabled amendments to that effect – that we must give railway undertakings that wish to join forces every encouragement we can, and we must ensure that, for example, they set up a joint reservation system, such as is already in place for a number of airline companies."
"In the event of accidents, death or injury of passengers, we believe that with regard to no-fault liability, in other words, in those cases where the railway undertaking are required to pay in any event, the same amounts must be used as those in the aviation regulation."
"As for luggage, we have adopted COTIF, because it contains a broader definition of luggage and also lists other amounts, but we felt that this was the best way of addressing this issue."
"I would now like to turn to the subject of compensation for delays and cancellations, in respect of which we proposed a simpler system."
"The Commission has made things rather complicated, but if we are to extend the scope to include all passengers, we think we should have a simpler system for compensation, and at the same time a system not only for compensation pertaining to delays that exceed one hour, but also for people who face delays on a regular basis, so that they too could obtain compensation."
"People with season tickets would otherwise not qualify, and we do not regard that as acceptable."
"One difficult chapter that attracted amendments by a very large number of Members was the chapter on people with reduced mobility."
"For people with impaired vision, hearing or a disability, we think that railway undertakings have a duty to pull out all the stops and observe a number of obligations."
"We have defined those in considerable detail, and we have more or less followed the Commission’s lead in this."
"In the event of prior warning, a commitment has been entered into and the railway undertaking has no choice but to help the passenger."
"If the passenger has not given prior warning and turns up without notice, then I think that the railway undertaking must do everything in its power to help those people."
"In fact, I think that most railway undertakings, most railway staff, see it as a matter of honour to help those people out."
"This is a case of us laying something down in law which is, in my view, a minimum requirement."
"I think that whilst we should encourage the railway undertakings to do everything they can for the people who have more difficulty in finding their way round in a railway station, and whilst we should expect much of them, we cannot expect everything."
"You cannot ask railway undertakings to do the impossible; what you can do is urge them, whenever there is a renovation, a structural alteration, or a new purchase, to ensure that the new materials and the new buildings satisfy today’s needs."
"There is an enormous legacy from the past, shall I say, resting on the shoulders of the railway undertakings, but they must slowly but surely be encouraged to make improvements."
"A complaints service must be set up, but we should not go overboard with regard to the used."
"I have simplified the proposal in terms of consequential damage, which I deleted."
"I believe that annual quality reports are unnecessary."
"We must achieve a more flexible system that allows room for initiative, for a broader application, for commercial initiatives of railway undertakings that are prepared to submit those, and for regional initiatives."
"Undertakings can therefore go beyond what we require, but – and that is, to my mind, essential in our position as Parliament – we think that those rights should apply to all passengers; not just to the elite of 5% that travels internationally, but to anyone using the train."
"That is the case in aviation, and there is no reason why that could not be the case in train travel."
"We are about to discuss this with the Council, but as far as I know, if my sources are reliable, this very issue, namely making the rights apply to all passengers, is a sticking point in the Council."
"I would like to say to the representative of the Council that this is one of the points that I as rapporteur will fight tooth and nail and I hope that I can count on the combined support of my fellow Members of this House."
"On a final note, I would like to say to the Council, as did the two previous speakers, that this is a package."
"I urge you not to take it apart. I invite you to treat it as you wish, but return it as a package and accompany it with common positions that we will be able to hammer out together at second reading."
"This is a cohesive whole; I would press you to keep it that way."
". – Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, in submitting to Parliament a draft regulation on compensation in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail services, the aim of the European Commission was to improve the quality of rail freight transport in the European Union’s internal market and thus to promote a shift of freight transport from road to rail."
"The intention was to increase, by this means, the proportion of freight transported by rail, which is currently very low."
"Basically, the draft regulation contains administrative measures and rules which are to be worked into contracts between rail companies and their customers."
"I should say right away that in competitive situations such a measure would not be conceivable, hence to a great extent the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on whether to support this regulation was based on either optimism or scepticism concerning increased competition in rail freight transport in the near future."
"In addition, as a representative of a new Member State, I was unpleasantly surprised by the fact that the draft regulation submitted in the spring of 2004 was based on research relating only to the 15 older Member States, and that a whole series of special features of the new Member States was not taken into account in the draft; these can be mentioned only by way of example."
"For instance, in the Baltic States over 50% of freight transport is by rail, as compared with almost 90% by road in other states."
"Secondly, in the three Baltic States almost all transportation of rail freight crosses European Union external borders connecting the sea ports of the Baltic States with the markets of Russia, Belarus and other CIS states."
"This, in turn, would mean that if this regulation were to be adopted, Latvia’s railways would constantly be paying compensation for delays occurring on Russian territory without any practical hope of obtaining any compensation from Russian railways."
"Leaving aside the above, as rapporteur I hoped to balance the draft text and to find a compromise between extremely diverse interest groups."
"At least to date, however, there has been no basis for such a compromise, and even after many debates at the Commission the majority of my colleagues on the committee believed that an administrative regulation was not the way to improve the quality of rail transport."
"I myself have come to various conclusions over this period of time, having become acquainted with the larger rail companies and also with infrastructure managers."
"I am concerned by the fact that if we do not adopt any measures in the sphere of freight transport shortly, then access to infrastructure will of course become even more of a priority for passengers, which in itself is not a bad thing, but the quality of freight transport will probably fall even further."
"For me, the most important conclusion from this study was that, clearly, we cannot draw up regulations on the basis of the problems of individual transport corridors without studying the particular features of European Union Member States, and using administrative methods only in places where competition is weak."
"Such a ‘one size fits all’ approach would clearly create a lack of trust among European Union citizens concerning the legislative plans of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council."
"Finally, I would like to say that I am very satisfied with the joint work by all the rapporteurs on this package, as well as by the shadow rapporteurs, and I do not understand the attempts to break up this third rail package, which might give practically nothing to customers."
"I will mention again an example from the Baltic States."
"If, for example, the idea contained in the report by Mr Sterckx, that passengers should also be given rights in respect of domestic transport, is removed and replaced with international transport only, then I can say that in the countries in my region — in the Baltic States — the entire third package will have no effect at all."
"The effect of all the three or four legislative acts will be of zero value."
"I do not want to set out these details, but unfortunately this is the case."
"I have made a detailed analysis of the possible effect on the Baltic States."
"Taking into account everything that has been said already, I call on my fellow Members to reject my report, as the Committee on Transport and Tourism has done, and at the same time I call on my fellow Members to support the package approach for the other three pieces of legislation and to support them in the wording approved by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the achievement of smoothly running cross-border rail-freight and passenger services requires not only harmonisation of technical standards, but also harmonisation and standardisation of professional, linguistic and medical requirements."
"This could be accomplished by means of the standardisation of competence mentioned in our proposal."
"We would thus achieve better interoperability of train crews in addition to improved rail-transport safety."
"This model would only be a real success, however, if, in the final reckoning, it were to mean less tape."
"I am very much obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Savary, for his constructive cooperation and also the compromises that have been reached."
"Firstly, we have managed to achieve a consensus in Committee even on critical points such as the extension that had been called for in the scope of the directive from train drivers to other train crew."
"We have agreed on a two-stage process, whereby the Railway Agency shall decide on the necessity of certification for other on-board staff at a later date."
"Secondly, we have managed to reduce the original subdivision into three categories of driving licence to two, which will lead to administrative simplification and streamlining."
"Thirdly, as regards regular monitoring of train drivers, we should like this to apply to only those aspects that concern the driving ability of the train driver."
"Fourthly, we wish the date on which the directive is introduced to coincide with the opening-up of the markets."
"Fifthly, on the issue of whether certification should relate only to train drivers on cross-border services or also include those on domestic services, we propose a gradual process of certification of all train drivers."
"All in all, these are pragmatic, unbureaucratic solutions that will have a simplifying and streamlining effect."
"This has been, and continues to be, the aim of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in this House."
"For this reason, and also because of the compromises that have been reached, the PPE-DE Group rejects Amendments 46 and 50."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to say a few words about the report on passengers’ rights: more particularly Amendment 138."
"This aims to put in place an entitlement under EU law to transport bicycles on all trains, and such an obsession with regulation, down to the last detail, is a further example of why much of the public is sceptical towards Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us give out the right signals."
". Mr President, I think that, when it comes to the transport sector, this Parliament has a good tradition of boosting rail transport and thus the rail sector."
"The Committee has borne this in mind, and it is likely, therefore, that we shall join together in plenary tomorrow to adopt, by a large majority, all the reports relating to the rail sector."
"I am obliged to all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, therefore, for their work, which evidently did produce a consensus in the end."
"No sooner had I had a discussion in my group than the railway package reappeared, in very abridged form, as the Jarzembowski report."
"I had to take issue with that, because there is of course a bit more to this railway package."
"In my opinion, the Savary report is very important."
"We need to have well-trained train drivers for cross-border transport in Europe, so that freight is transported well and safely by train drivers with well-qualified staff on board, who should also have proper social security cover."
"For this reason, I believe that the Savary report regarding freight transport is an important step forward."
"I think that the Sterckx report is also important, in that passengers’ rights, too, are being properly regulated in Europe at last, and in that the customers – the passengers – are to be entitled to reasonable compensation, as is the case with other modes of transport, in the event of delays for which the operator is to blame."
"With regard to the Zīle report, I must say that the Commission sometimes goes too far."
"As Mr Zīle has pointed out, he has done a very good job; yet the majority of the Committee – myself included – had reservations."
"On the subject of the quality requirements for freight transport, I must say that we have to start depending on the market before the market is capable of regulating anything."
"What is critical, in my view, is that we boost the rail sector."
"It was one of the Commissioner’s predecessors, Commissioner Kinnock, who coined the slogan about the revitalisation of Europe’s railways."
"Mr Kinnock (‘Old’ Labour rather than ‘New Labour’) was right with his ‘roadmap’, because our problem is that the volume of both freight and passenger transport by rail has been decreasing progressively since the 1970s."
"As the energy situation is now extremely critical, and we know that the transport sector is the greatest energy consumer of all, we have to take the opportunity to encourage a shift away from the roads and, increasingly, from flying – we keep coming back to the kerosene tax – in favour of the railways."
"Therefore, the railways must have a cross-border structure for both freight and passenger transport."
"This must not fall at the hurdle of former public officials with – sometimes sacrosanct – government property; instead, the way must be cleared for a rational new policy."
"This is our first reading."
"We all know that, sooner or later, a common position will be forthcoming, and there will be a second reading."
"We shall all meet again then."
"That being the case, we do not need to get so worked up."
"I do think, however, that we shall, together, be adopting a sensible measure tomorrow."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in my view the third railway package – which I hope is the last – represents something of a final opportunity for European railways; the last chance to reverse a negative trend which is seeing rail as a mode of transport losing market share at a rate which, if it were to continue, would virtually wipe it out in the space of a few years."
"Time is not on the side of the railways, although European policy continues to claim that shifting the transport balance in favour of rail is strategic, because of the negative impact of increasing road traffic in terms of fatal accidents, damage to public health and the environment and the increasing cost of congestion; and yet this trend is occurring despite the fact that priority projects to develop the trans-European network are primarily focused on investment in the railways."
"We therefore have one last chance to take radical and urgent measures which will allow the objectives of the European treaties to be met – objectives which go back to Rome and 1956 – in which Europe, the Union, set itself the goal of achieving integration of national transport networks at European level, making them interoperable technically and economically and liberalising access to them; an objective devised as a physical prerequisite for the development of Europe, either as a market or a political entity."
"Today we have this last chance, which requires great vision on the part of this Parliament and its co-legislator the European Council, because it requires the European institutions, the political institutions, to take responsibility for something which the national rail undertakings lack the courage, skill or ability to do, namely to stop defending shrinking monopolistic market segments, which are increasingly unable to generate traffic revenue to cover their costs, and instead seek to expand the total market, with potential benefits for all."
"This can only be achieved if conditions are created for competition among railways, which would also give them the ability to compete with other modes of transport and enable market share to be recaptured, leading in turn to further competition among railway companies within a virtuous circle."
"To achieve this we need to accelerate both technical interoperability, the lack of which today creates an artificial barrier separating the individual domestic rail markets, and economic interoperability, by liberalising access to the networks."
"The third package is a vital component of that strategy."
"The way ahead in terms of technical interoperability is clear, but we must acknowledge the contribution of the third package in its proposal for a directive on the certification of train crews, contained in the Savary report; only by training the staff can we make the system interoperable, even before it becomes technically interoperable."
"However, the third package requires Parliament and the Council to assume their respective responsibilities in terms of the ‘if’ and ‘how’ of liberalisation."
"The issue of market liberalisation has been left to the proposed directive on the development of the Community's railways, which it is planned to apply to passenger transport from 2008 on international routes and from 2012 on domestic ones."
"This is the crucial point for Parliament to add value to the proposal: these facts and deadlines, particularly the second of 2012, do not match the urgency of the situation, even if the compromise may be a reasonable one, taking account of the concerns of national railway companies less able to face up to market challenges in what will, in any event, continue to be their natural monopolies."
"These concerns should not be accorded such importance that the type of authorisation is overlooked, with the possibility of awarding domestic public rail transport contracts and services directly and without a competitive process, which is what the revised version of the proposed regulation on public service transport obligations implies."
"Parliament views that proposal favourably, as it offers the possibility to move ahead on the Meijer report, which has been awaiting the Council’s common position for years."
"If Parliament today, and the Council tomorrow, reject on other fronts those proposed regulations on the rights and obligations of passengers, a similar compromise may eliminate the artificial distinction between international passengers and domestic passengers."
"Will the latter, perhaps, continue to be treated as second class citizens, with fewer rights than international passengers?"
"There is no justification for this distinction, except to continue protecting markets, while passengers are not receiving due protection – to the short-term benefit of the national companies."
"There is one final point: the Commission has insisted on the need to keep the measures of the third railway package unified."
"On this point, adequate assurances have been sought and obtained by the UK Presidency, which will work to ensure that the Council completes its examination of the Sterckx report and continues to work on the Jarzembowski and Meyer reports."
"However, apart from the formal aspect, the unity of the package has a deeper logic: liberalisation, as we can infer from various earlier experiments, requires various checks and balances, one of which is undoubtedly consumer protection."
"If consumers are protected, liberalisation can be effective and efficient; if it does not work, or if there is any risk of it becoming dangerous, consumers will not be protected."
"In my view, the Zīle report should have been considered in these terms, but the decisions have already been taken, and I will abide by them."
"In the belief that there is a functional reason to keep the package together, I hope that, on the basis of these considerations, we can achieve the result we are all seeking."
". Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, am very much obliged to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"Until now, unrestricted travel through Europe, from Lisbon to Tallinn, from London to Athens, has been possible only by road or air."
"The rail network, on the other hand, resembles a patchwork quilt with 25 patches, and so the railways are being left behind."
"The national networks should be opened up."
"At the same time, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants to be sure that social and environmental interests are also safeguarded."
"In addition, we must learn from the mistakes in the United Kingdom and Estonia, for example."
"Europe cannot be content with the situation on the railways, and the customers certainly cannot."
"Excessively high prices, frequent delays and poor service tend to be the norm."
"Moreover, schedules are not passenger-friendly. I shall give three examples."
"In Germany, the rail operator Deutsche Bahn AG is planning to stop mainline trains from calling at Berlin Zoo station."
"Passengers are up in arms, with the unanimous support of Parliament and politicians in general."
"Yet Deutsche Bahn AG is not yielding: politicians have had to capitulate."
"In Italy, there are plans to upgrade the railway line between Milan and Verona for high-speed trains but this will involve bypassing Brescia, the second-largest city in Lombardy, whose 200 000 residents will now see their journeys extended by 30 minutes."
"Here, too, politicians seem to be powerless."
"Then the national parliaments, and Parliament in its report on tourism, have decided that passengers should be permitted to take their bicycles on board high-speed trains."
"It is possible to do this on French TGV trains, but not on the German ICE."
"Yet Deutsche Bahn AG will not budge; politicians are helpless."
"That is why the Verts/ALE Group, too, wants the parliaments and the elected politicians to regain their influence over railway policy."
"The European driving licence for train drivers will render driver changes at the border between Member States unnecessary."
"Passengers’ rights are to be strengthened in the passenger-rail services of all EU Member States, with the possibility of legally enforceable claims for compensation in the event of delays."
"It should be possible to take bicycles on board all trains, and comprehensive information and the option of buying tickets to anywhere in Europe should be the norm."
"Access is to be guaranteed for the mobility-impaired."
"No compensation mechanism is necessary for freight transport."
"National railway networks should be opened up gradually in the case of passenger transport, too."
"We shall be making our consent to this conditional upon the following, however: there must be no social dumping, and consideration must be given to the interests of the environment, as Parliament demanded in the Meijer report."
"In this connection, we welcome the fact that, several years on, the Commission has finally drawn up the new proposal for public services and sent it to Parliament."
"There must be no destructive competition."
"For this reason, invitations to tender can be dispensed with if the existence of domestic railway undertakings is threatened."
"We need a report on competition experience to date: we want to emulate the good and learn from the mistakes."
"The experiences in Britain and Estonia have shown that the infrastructure must remain fully in the public sector."
"We see this as an essential requirement."
"In conclusion, we, too, are in favour of the package remaining a package, and we hope that the Council also comes to the sensible decision and treats it as one."
"Thank you for your attention."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, other colleagues from my group will be taking the floor in this debate, in particular my colleague Erik Meijer."
"For my part, I will confine my contribution to explaining the thinking behind our amendment rejecting the proposal for a directive inappropriately entitled, ‘the development of the Community’s railways’."
"We wholeheartedly believe that it is high time to overhaul the organisation of the transport sector on our continent."
"This should be done in accordance with the criteria that our fellow citizens value: safety, the environment, social and territorial cohesion, the public service, and their corollary, high standards of harmonised social regulation for the workers concerned."
"The sector’s unions have some very carefully worked out proposals on all of these aspects."
"They should be our natural partners when planning and implementing this kind of project."
"In this context, the aspiration to achieve a more balanced use of rail – and, moreover, inland waterways – is in every respect legitimate and Europe is of course a relevant arena in which to address these issues."
"The question is as follows: what is there to say that achieving such objectives should at all costs require all-out liberalisation of the rail transport sector?"
"This would at the very least merit a serious evaluation of the various different experiences with this model so far and the initial impact of opening up to competition before any new measures are taken."
"That is moreover what Parliament explicitly demanded when the first railway package was adopted."
"This express request has never been met."
"Why not?"
"For example, not a word has been said about the disastrous consequences of rail privatisation in the United Kingdom."
"You pass very swiftly, Mr Barrot, over the fact that the first private train in France, owned by Connex, is not carrying any additional traffic, but is happy to occupy a place held until now by the public company SNCF."
"Neither is any mention made of the decline in the diversity of services offered in the freight transport sector, or of the fact that passenger routes that are deemed to be unprofitable have been abandoned with a view to the opening up to competition."
"What is more, there is barely a murmur about projects which have a real chance of improving European transport, such as the Lyon-Turin link, being blocked."
"No!"
"We liberalise and that is all there is to it."
"It is this dogmatism of ‘markets everywhere’ that our group is protesting against. We do so in a bid to reiterate the demand for a public and pluralist assessment of the experiences so far and to express our preferred choice of cooperation and not competition in the rail transport sector in Europe."
"Our group calls on all of our Members to vote in favour of Amendment 14, which rejects the proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of rail transport."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, rail issues are by their very nature of interest to all of those living in the European Union and all of its Member States."
"For a long time, geography determined the transport services on offer and nations’ policies."
"Today, technology and the construction of major infrastructures are enriching the sector and in their turn determining the future of economic and cultural exchanges."
"We have a role to play in this sector: building bridges between nations and promoting exchange."
"But not just any old exchange!"
"We need an exchange that enriches national specificities, because the exchange has to be of a complementary nature to be justified and worthwhile."
"We are delighted to have texts promoting such genuinely free exchanges between sovereign peoples."
"Nevertheless, reading the three reports that have been tabled today, it seems to us that three simple principles, governing how nations are ordered, have been disregarded."
"The first principle that does not seem to us to have been respected in every case is that of subsidiarity."
"In the transport sector, as elsewhere, we think that everything that can be done at the level closest to the action should be done at that level, and only what is absolutely necessary will be left to the higher level."
"We therefore do not understand why the Sterckx report, which rightly cites the international convention COTIF, hastens to encumber the text with a surfeit of details that ought to be dealt with under this convention, a convention which we ought by the way to be relaunching."
"In this particular case, extending the rights of those with reduced mobility is the exception, as it is vital to do so."
"But this imperative could be the subject of a simple injunction of principle to COTIF."
"Furthermore, why, by the same token, in Mr Savary’s excellent report on staff training, is a clearer distinction not drawn between the training of drivers on the one hand and that of train crews on the other?"
"Why not simply certify different competences, since the professions are radically different?"
"The second principle that we feel has been abused is the respect for sovereignty."
"We cannot allow the fact that transport services need to be organised at international level to become a Trojan Horse to invade national law."
"The amended Sterckx report systematically substitutes the expression ‘all rail passengers’ for the notion of ‘international rail passengers’."
"We cannot agree to national law being made subordinate to international law in this way."
"The third principle that is disregarded is that of prudence."
"There is a lack of prudence when, in Mr Jarzembowski’s report, Amendment 8 proposes a period of only three years to implement significant changes."
"We have to give these things time: too hasty and you are doomed to failure."
"There is also a lack of prudence in the Sterckx report in that it tries to deal with everything in one single dossier: with disability, ticketing, compensation in the case of accidents and penalties in the case of substandard services."
"Dealing with everything means losing relevance."
"A lack of prudence is also displayed in the failure to state clearly that the railways should serve the needs above all of freight and in particular long-distance freight."
"Similarly there is a lack of prudence in the failure to first include these proposals in the report on very competitive modes of transport."
"In conclusion, we acknowledge the painstaking and commendable work done by the Commissioner, but once again we remain doubtful about such an avalanche of legal provisions and the effectiveness of this Parliament’s methods."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although it is late in the evening, I am approaching this debate on the third rail package with one certainty, namely that we have a duty to Europe to support a project which aims to revitalise rail transport, both for the sake of passengers and also – perhaps above all – for the sake of the intermodal transport of goods."
"We view it as a duty not only for environmental protection, but also for the safety of the transport system, in the widest sense of the term, in the hope that revitalising rail transport will help to cut death rates and road accidents in general, which, we should remember, have an extremely high social cost for Member States."
"Although the group of non-attached Members whom I coordinate in the committee has, with that traditional discrimination typical of parliamentary rules, had very little opportunity to intervene, I agree with much of the work of my colleagues."
"Mr Sterckx has issued a report which finally acknowledges consumers' right to reimbursement for rail delays – at least substantial ones."
"That is a right we in the Committee wished to establish also for passengers on domestic lines (as well as international ones, obviously) which, in my view, is intrinsically equitable."
"I should also like to emphasise the shared sensitivity that exists in relation to the provisions introduced for passengers with mobility problems."
"I also approve the Savary report in relation to the need for a common certification system for train crews, the necessary standardisation of their professional skills and the monitoring of their state of health."
"I hope that greater guarantees can also be demanded in terms of the number of drivers, which in my view should never be less than two."
"I should also like to thank our colleague Mr Jarzembowski, whose report aims to foster an improvement of rail services through greater competition, thereby benefiting the consumer, although I have some doubts on this, because improvements will only occur if liberalisation does not result in yet another rush to cut labour costs."
"Finally, I approve the Zīle report, which has attempted to respond to the concerns of our committee for compulsory compensation in the event of failure to meet the deadlines for freight delivery."
"I therefore urge Members to support the reports already approved by the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"Mr President, I should like to start in a similar vein to our oft-quoted colleague Mr Jarzembowski, by raising what you might call a point of order."
"I have been a Member of this House for ten years now, and still do not know exactly who is really responsible for work programming with regard to our plenary sittings."
"Whoever they are, they are no friends of Parliament."
"This week and this evening’s discussion are quite typical examples that prove this point."
"Wherever Parliament does not really have anything to say – at least, nothing binding – this is scheduled for and discussed during prime time, whilst the few legislative acts scheduled for this twelfth plenary sitting in Strasbourg – which is otherwise completely superfluous – are tucked away in the evening sitting."
"We should not be surprised, in such situations, if people in Europe are less and less inclined to take us seriously."
"The turnout at the recent European elections springs to mind."
"After that digression, let me pass on to the main issue, which is the Sterckx report and passengers’ rights."
"This text makes a constructive contribution to creating the much-discussed level playing field for the various modes of transport in Europe."
"To enter into direct competition with direct competitors, the railways need comparable framework conditions, and so it was right and necessary for us to now give priority to establishing the railway counterpart of the ‘night-boarding’ legislation for air transport."
"The text presented by the Commission on this subject was – shall we say – capable of improvement, and, sensibly, we have made a few changes to it: some of them quite fundamental."
"Firstly – probably the most fundamental of the changes – we have subsumed all transport services, not only international services, under this new regulation, although special arrangements, which we are sure to need, will have to be made within the framework of the regulation on public local passenger transport services."
"Secondly, we have attached particular importance to providing and demanding proper information on passengers’ rights."
"What is the use to consumers if they do not know to which rights they are actually entitled?"
"Thirdly, this text provides for a rational coordination and – only on certain points, of course – supplementation of the CODIF regulations: unlike one previous speaker, I consider this not only very important, but also a resounding success."
"This has been a specific instance of subsidiarity in practice and, in this sense, has also been a kind of complementary action to the Commission’s ‘better regulation’ initiative, for which we are grateful and which, in plain English, means tidying up European legislation, which is frequently verbose."
"In conclusion, I am very much obliged to the rapporteur, Mr Sterckx, for his pleasant, constructive cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in considering the draft package, my political group was guided mainly by concern over the role of the railways in the European Union’s transport network, and by their potential for development."
"In our view, although there is much discussion about liberalisation, the latter is not an end in itself but a means to an end."
"Many questions arose concerning how to attain that end, namely increasing rail transport."
"It is important to bear in mind that the European Union is a Union of 25 Member States, and that the rail networks in the new Member States are relatively weak and being restructured."
"In addition, changes cannot be introduced too suddenly, they should be brought in progressively."
"We warned against a situation where the more powerful railway undertakings absorbed the weaker ones."
"Taking over the market brings with it the duty to provide a public service."
"It is worth considering whether the final outcome might be that a large railway company’s monopoly in one of the Union’s Member States might not be replaced or extended to become a monopoly by that same company but covering the territory of several Member States?"
"Are we considering any restrictions?"
"It does not seem to us that we are doing so at present."
"Commissioner, the road and air transport sectors are enjoying market success in Europe."
"In their case, however, deregulation was brought in along with liberalisation."
"A solution that would reconcile market roles with the provision of a public service should therefore be found for the railways also."
"I cooperated with Mr Jarzembowski concerning the changes to Council Directive 91/440/EEC."
"This compromise is more radical than the Commission’s proposal, so I would like to enquire whether you feel that perhaps our compromise goes too far, Commissioner?"
"Might it not be preferable to confine ourselves to the Commission’s proposal, so only international transport was affected?"
"Our concern is mainly for the quality of transport services provided."
"Allow me to refer to the journey between Warsaw and Brussels by way of example."
"If you fly with LOT or SNBrussels Airlines you pay EUR 300 and it takes two hours to get to Brussels National airport."
"If you fly with a low-cost airline you pay EUR 120 and arrive at Charleroi airport."
"A first class train ticket costs EUR 150 and the journey takes 18 hours."
"If you chose to travel by private car, the journey takes 13 hours if you keep to the speed limits and the fuel costs EUR 150, but four people can travel together."
"Is that not an important consideration?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, my main remarks are on the reports by Mr Savary and Mr Zīle, for which I was my group’s shadow rapporteur, and I wish to thank both rapporteurs, who have each been working under very different conditions, for their efforts."
"Mr Savary’s report concerns a proposal that almost everyone supports, while Mr Zīle had the job of getting backing for a proposal by the Commission that only very few people are interested in."
"My group is satisfied with the outcome of the vote in the committee, where the proposal for compensation in connection with freight transport was rejected."
"That is not the same as saying that we see no problems with the quality of freight transport by train."
"Unfortunately, there is a lot to suggest that the quality is not improving and that, in certain areas, it is perhaps even on the decline."
"Lack of punctuality and flexibility mean that, directly contrary to all political intentions, freight transport by train is falling behind."
"The question, then, is: how are we to solve this problem?"
"The Commission’s proposal was too clumsy and out of step with the conditions in a free market."
"However, Mr Zīle deserves recognition for his attempt to find a solution other than a flat rejection, even if – as I assume it will be when we vote tomorrow – the result is just such a rejection."
"I am in no doubt that, as liberalisation and free competition progressively take root, train services will become more efficient and we shall see better value for money and a greater focus on passengers."
"We shall see better quality than that delivered by the national monopolies, and I find it thought-provoking that the number of passenger miles travelled by train in Great Britain, which has of course done a lot of liberalising over the last ten years, has increased by as much as 40%."
"I also find it thought-provoking that those countries that invest single-mindedly in modern railway services using high-speed trains also see those services making progress at a time when trains are otherwise losing ground in many countries."
"Liberalisation is therefore important as well as investment if, regarding not only freight transport but also passenger transport, we are to guarantee railway services an increased market share."
"It is also important that we speed up the process."
"The common framework for the training of train crews is, of course, a logical consequence of the liberalisation that has already been agreed."
"Mr Savary’s report is therefore the least controversial of those relating to the third railway package."
"The big debate has of course been about who is to be covered by the Directive on the certification of train crews."
"Shall it be train drivers only, or other staff too? Shall it be exclusively those involved in international rail services or also those involved in purely national services?"
"My group is generally satisfied with the result we now have."
"A suitable balance has been found whereby train drivers and other staff directly involved in safety are included."
"It was a wise decision to have the rules initially cover international train services. Once we have used a cost-benefit analysis in order carefully to weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, we can then, in time, look at whether staff involved in purely national services should be included."
"Where drivers are concerned, this is, of course, expensive training we are faced with, so it is important that we do not impose unnecessary costs on the train companies."
"Last but not least, I want, for my own part, to say how very pleased I am that Parliament’s proposed third railway package welcomes the liberalisation of passenger transport and introduces common rules for passengers’ rights which apply to all passengers and which, in addition, are much simpler and much less bureaucratic than the Commission’s proposal."
"Mr Savary also asks what is to be done about the small countries."
"I myself come from a small country in which free competition for railway services has progressively been introduced and in which the national railway company, DSB, is in competition at home and, at the same time, now operates in Sweden and has been given permission to offer routes in Great Britain."
"DSB has equipped itself for free competition through modernisation and through the reorganisation of its activities so that the old monopolistic and statist culture has been replaced by a modern business culture that places more focus on the passenger."
"That is the way forward."
"Mr President, I am not going to philosophise on the notion of a package but I can tell you that my group intends to vote enthusiastically for the Sterckx report and the Savary report and is delighted to be able to do so tomorrow."
"With regard to Mr Jarzembowski’s proposal, on the other hand, the discussions have been more closely argued and doubtful, because we are not in favour of the status quo."
"To make matters clear: we really want to strengthen European rail transport because we want to encourage means of transport that are safer and more economical in terms of energy and space and therefore more sustainable."
"That seems to me perfectly clear."
"The question we are asking ourselves is this: will this objective be achieved through the liberalisation of international rail passenger transport under the conditions outlined in this report?"
"That is where questions start to arise."
"Will we actually achieve a transfer from road and air to rail?"
"Will we guarantee a safer and more accessible service for people and better social and territorial cohesion?"
"To find out, surely we could conduct a serious evaluation."
"We have experience, within the Member States, of passenger transport being opened up to competition; we have the first and second packages."
"Let us take a closer look at what happens in terms of quality, of real transfer from road to rail, of prices and of safety."
"In short, there are many questions."
"We wonder about the compatibility between the opening up to competition of national corridors through cabotage and respect for the obligations of public service as set out in the July regulation."
"We ask ourselves, as indeed do other Members, whether we are not going to move, in some countries, from a monopoly situation to an oligopoly situation or whether we are not going to see the emergence, as in air transport, of low cost companies, to the detriment of working conditions and safety."
"In short, for the majority of my group it is inconceivable for us to support Mr Jarzembowski’s proposals."
"Mr President, the liberalisation plans have far-reaching consequences not only for railway staff, but also greatly affect the quality of service to passengers."
"The close cooperation of national railway companies with their neighbours is much older than the European Union."
"That results in fast, cross-border, long-distance trains with matching ticket sales."
"This European success is now being undermined by increasing competitive rivalry, as a result of which railway companies will seek to reject the least profitable and least subsidised tasks first."
"While everyone thinks we are drawing Europe closer together, railway companies are confining themselves to mass transport in the large urban areas and to a few fast mainline connections within Member States."
"Many cross-border stretches are served only by slow trains; through night trains are being thinned out or disappearing altogether."
"Only in Germany are European ticket sales and the provision of information top-notch, and only the cross-border high-speed line between Brussels and Paris is busy."
"Elsewhere, it is becoming more and more difficult to buy tickets for foreign destinations further afield."
"Passengers have to change trains en route more often, which also increases waiting times."
"Passengers on delayed trains from neighbouring countries, which mainly get into difficulty at night, are increasingly given a rough deal, and land up in an exasperating web of confusion."
"That is what drives those passengers to use aircraft and cars, while the Commission’s White Paper on transport took for granted that there would be more medium-distance transport of passengers by rail by 2010."
"Over the past six years, I have demonstrated on many occasions, on the basis of practical experience, how our rail transport is deteriorating."
"I am therefore delighted with the Commission proposal that at long last offers some counter weight to the adverse effects of liberalisation and commercialisation."
"It is unfortunate that Mr Sterckx, the rapporteur, has not taken the crisis in international passenger transport by rail as his point of departure, but rather the irritation of railway companies that would prefer self-regulation to a requirement imposed from the European level that they should achieve the German quality standard."
"His proposals detract from the improvements for cross-border transport and unnecessarily increase European interference in domestic rail transport."
"This proposal is a missed opportunity for improving conditions for international passengers and for putting a stop to worsening trends."
"My group fears that the regulation as set out by Mr Sterckx does not adequately address the problems, the consequence being that it will need to be reviewed within a few years’ time."
"My group has tabled a number of amendments in order to prevent that from happening, as well as to ensure that European railways show a united front to the public and that shortcomings can be more speedily remedied."
"Mr President, this report proposes the harmonisation of rail passenger rights and compensation liabilities throughout the European Union."
"Such legislation faces the opposition of national railway companies who know they will suffer increased administrative burdens, the cost of which will be passed on to passengers."
"Mr Sterckx says that we should not tinker with international agreements which are already satisfactory."
"He says that we must not take over the role of railway company marketing managers."
"Above all, he says that the system must benefit passengers."
"Only an EU politician could say all that and then propose extending the scope of legislation."
"There is already a perfectly good international agreement in place between 42 nations, including many non-EU countries, to facilitate cross-border railway travel."
"In 2002 international railway companies signed a voluntary Charter containing quality standards for rail passenger services – the COTIF Convention."
"We cannot legislate, for example, for French, German and British railways."
"They all operate under very different conditions."
"National governments, in conjunction with railway operators, should decide what regulation is appropriate, not the European Union."
"To be fair, the Commission only wanted regulation to cover cross-border rail travel, but Mr Sterckx goes further by proposing regulation for in-country domestic rail travel."
"In another report from the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerning the certification of train crews, the rapporteur, Mr Savary, calls for the psychological testing of train crews."
"May I suggest that psychological testing be extended to the rapporteurs of this Parliament?"
"Perhaps a simple word association test would be useful."
"If in response rapporteurs used the words 'integration', 'harmonisation' or 'regulation', they should be immediately disqualified from holding office."
"This might possibly cut down the amount of this kind of nonsense, but not, I suspect, until we have first legislated for harmonised and integrated psychology tests."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the train is the only mode of transport in Europe to be experiencing a worrying period of stagnation, despite the increase in trade."
"The environmental emergency, the high cost of oil and congestion on the roads require a firm decision on rail transport, which is cleaner and safer and has good domestic infrastructures which can be integrated at European level."
"To revitalise and modernise rail transport is a matter of priority for the future of the Union."
"The Commission has made considerable efforts towards increased harmonisation and liberalisation of the markets, but it is the European Parliament which has had – and still has – a central role to play in this area by overcoming national self-interest."
"The courageous proposal to open up even domestic passenger transport to full liberalisation is vital to complete the single market, relaunch community rail services and provide a better service to the population."
"In this context, the amendment on reciprocity, which I proposed and with which the Commission concurred, ensures that countries which opt to open up their markets prior to the set deadlines should be protected against unfair competition from rail companies operating in protected domestic markets."
"I also believe that the regulations on passengers’ rights and their extension to domestic traffic are particularly important."
"Payment of compensation for delays, damage and accidents, and the rights of disabled passengers provide an excellent basis to encourage our companies to adopt high quality standards and to be competitive with other modes of transport."
"A shift to rail transport, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those challenges where the credibility and future of Europe are at stake. For this reason, it is vital that Parliament takes a strong and clear stance on this package and does not hesitate to opt for a strategy of innovation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in my speech, I will confine myself to two sections of the package and will obviously start with Mr Sterckx’s report."
"I should like to thank him for the excellent cooperation, which, I think, enabled us to thrash out sound compromise proposals in the key areas."
"The practice run we had for airline passengers turned out useful for train passengers too, all train passengers in fact, so also including those using national rail transport."
"Our group considers it important that we did not only work out a general compensation scheme for delays exceeding one hour, but also for repeated short delays, so that undertakings are encouraged to work more efficiently and be more punctual, and can in that way also attract new customers, which is, after all, what we set out to do."
"I would like to say a few words about assistance for people with reduced mobility, on which we have tabled two additional amendments."
"First of all, notification of such assistance should not be made 48 hours, but 24 hours, in advance."
"I think that that is very reasonable, and would ask you to endorse it."
"Secondly, the training of rail staff should also give attention to that aspect of the job."
"It remains important to us that rail passengers can readily purchase their train tickets at all times, whether from ticket offices at train stations, from ticket machines, or, in the absence of ticket machines, on the trains themselves."
"The rapporteur would now like to make exceptions for cases where seat reservations are compulsory, which I can understand, but also for the purpose of combating fraud."
"I too am against fraud, but I fear that if we follow your line, then we will end up with an empty box, and that is something we cannot endorse."
"I would now like to turn to Mr Jarzembowski’s report."
"I am a little surprised at the ease with which a majority of my fellow Members in the Committee on Transport and Tourism want to rush the Commission and intend to liberalise the whole railway system by 2012, without too much research, or without carrying out a thorough analysis of the impact this would have on national rail networks, which, as you know, differ greatly from each other, not least in terms of structure, or without asking whether that is the universal remedy that will enable us to attract more rail passengers."
"I think we should acknowledge that liberalising the market was undoubtedly a good thing in certain sectors."
"In the public transport sector, however, this is not, in my view, the case, as it is not a commercial sector and we also want to achieve objectives other than cost-effectiveness or profit, such as environmental objectives or people’s mobility."
"Measures other than liberalising the market have a far greater impact on the number of rail passengers than is often appreciated."
"I would give you the example of Belgium, where the number of passengers in 2003 rose by 7% and in 2004 by 6%, and the latest figures are also promising."
"This was not achieved by liberalising, but by modernising, by offering a better service, better facilities and by adopting an innovative price policy."
"For the record, I have no problems with liberalising international passenger transport as such."
"In the case of the Thalys, I would not object to competition hotting up, as long as there were sound guarantees in place that all Member States, both now and in future, would be able to develop good public services."
"Therefore, it would have been preferable had we had a package on liberalisation on the one hand and the provision of public services on the other, rather than the package that is before us now."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Sterckx, Mr Jarzembowski, Mr Savary and Mr Zīle on their reports on the liberalisation of rail transport networks and services in the European Union, the quality of service, the certification of crews and the rights and obligations of passengers."
"For our part, and with regard to the development of Community railways, we are fully in favour of supporting the opening up of transport services in general and, in particular, of passenger transport by rail, to private competition, though we are working on the basis that the road infrastructure is in the hands of independent managers, so that all possible users of the networks may have equal opportunities to access them."
"In this regard, we are calling for the opening up of international rail passenger services to be brought forward to 2008 and we accept that the different Member States should be able to delay the liberalisation of the other national, regional and local passenger services until 2012."
"We believe that this opening up should be carried out in a regulated fashion and without jeopardising the economic viability and survival of pre-existing services of public interest."
"We do not want to prejudice either the citizens or the urban, metropolitan or regional transport services which currently exist under the aegis of the public institutions."
"We have advocated that, if the relevant objective economic analyses carried out by the regulatory bodies of each Member State show it to be advisable, the States should be able limit the right of access of an international service to a particular infrastructure on a regional route or restrict the right to pick up or drop off passengers at stations on that route."
"Furthermore, we shall advocate reciprocal treatment, in such a way that those States which bring forward their opening up to private rail services may temporarily restrict that right to companies belonging to rail groups based in those other States in which similar conditions of freedom of access to the rail infrastructure do not exist."
"In other words, if a State does not open up its networks to competition, its companies will not be able to operate in other States which have done so."
"Finally, we believe that contracts for the provision of private rail services must have a duration of five years, which may be extended to 10 years in the event that they use a specialised infrastructure and require significant investments."
"A longer period could only be authorised in very special cases of very large long-term investments, which would require, for this purpose, the inclusion of a multi-annual repayment plan which would deal with time periods, investments, disinvestments, repayments and how to deal with such a significant initial economic outlay."
"We believe that the opening up and liberalisation of passenger services with every guarantee of quality, safety and certification of drivers, as well as appropriate regulation of the rights of passengers, will provide the Union’s citizens with the mobility necessary for the sustainable development and progress that we see as our future objective."
"– The third railway package, the individual reports comprising which have little in common, is an example of a hurried, uncoordinated and therefore damaging approach to railway transportation."
"When the second railway package was adopted, it was clearly and unambiguously stated that the package would be evaluated as soon as possible, and only then would further measures be taken, which is why our minority view of liberalisation is negative."
"I believe that the time has come to adopt a directive dealing with a harmonised locomotive operator’s licence, which is something we all agree on."
"The other matters are far from being as pressing as they are presented here."
"If, ladies and gentlemen, you want to open the railway market to competition today, it will be a harmful step."
"What is more, it is necessary to start to implement the CER agreement, the international association of railway infrastructure companies and the transport commissioner, as soon as possible."
"Does your desire to liberalise at all costs really take priority over harmonised safety and security standards for infrastructure and rolling stock?"
"This is something I cannot agree with, and so in this matter, with all due respect to the rapporteur, Georg Jarzembowski, I must ask you for an unambiguous ‘no’ vote."
"We abide by the agreements reached when adopting the second railway package, and we will strive to return to the subject by the deadline set, or in other words by 2008."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the railway unions of the Czech Republic and the Czech Government have asked me to lend explicit support to the Savary report, and to reject the Jarzembowski report."
"In conclusion, I should like to point out that rejecting the draft Zïle report and disagreeing with the Jarzembowski report is not a good omen for the attempt to rush the packages through."
"The excellent proposals in the Savary report have our support."
"I should like to inform the Commissioner that the Sterckx and Jarzembowski reports are in no way interdependent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for being given the floor and would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski and the other Members who contributed to the work on the whole railway package."
"In particular, I should like to refer to the drafting of the report on the proposal for a directive on the development of the Community’s railways."
"In the course of our work in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, many negative opinions were expressed concerning the dates and programme proposed by the rapporteur for opening up passenger services for competition."
"I made my views known on those occasions, as I am familiar with the condition of the railways in the new Member States and am aware that they are inadequately prepared to compete with large and powerful Western European countries in the open market."
"I am not opposed to liberalisation of the transport market, but I would argue for fair competition."
"Allow me to reiterate that I am not against the liberalisation of services so long as it is fairly done."
"Provisions must be put in place to protect small undertakings and also to ensure monopolies do not arise in the future and that the major players in this field are exposed to healthy and fair competition."
"For all these reasons I believe that Parliament should not support Mr Jarzembowski’s proposal to bring liberalisation of the market forward to 2008."
"I have in mind the opening up of international transport, including cabotage."
"We should not back this proposal if we genuinely wish to implement the Union’s policy of equal rights and fair competition, which would allow the new Member States time to come up to the standards of experienced undertakings in Germany, England and France."
"As Vice-Chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism, I appeal to the House to support the original European Commission proposal regarding dates and programmes for liberalisation namely opening up international transport without cabotage from 2010."
"I also call on the House to reject Mr Jarzembowski’s report, because the proposal voted through in the Committee on Transport and Tourism concerning opening up this market did not take account of the situation in the new Member States."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their good work and, above all, for the debates, which were excellent in terms of content and have been instrumental in achieving the quality of our proposals."
"It is high time rail transport in Europe became more efficient and more customer-friendly."
"That is why I should like to start with a question to Mr Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission."
"How do you assess the implementation of the first and second railway packages by the Member States and what steps will you take in order to accelerate this?"
"After all, and that is my belief, the effective introduction of those two railway packages in practice is far more important for the improvement of train services than decisions on new rules."
"The certification of train drivers is desperately needed and the abandonment of the quality requirements for freight transport will not create any problems, since that sector is quite capable of organising these things for itself."
"Whilst Mr Sterckx has done a sterling job of simplifying the proposal for passengers’ rights, under the leadership of Mr Jarzembowski, this House will be voting in favour of the liberalisation of passenger transport."
"This is to be welcomed where international transport is concerned, but the proposal for liberalising domestic transport is taking matters too far in my book, because forced competition on domestic rail sections by competing railway companies is not a guarantee for a better provision of services and is, indeed, compromising the train services’ punctuality and reliability, especially on dense, wide networks."
"We must take seriously the developments that have ensued in practice since the vote on the second railway package – by which I mean both the problems and the arrival of the new Member States."
"Member States must retain the freedom to organise necessary competition differently, like in the Netherlands, for example, with concessions for a core network to one railway company."
"We, the Dutch delegation of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) will therefore be voting against Amendments 2 and 9."
"Since the Council is unenthusiastic about Parliament’s far-reaching position, the necessary discussions will undoubtedly follow in due course."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am from a country and a region which, as a result of their history and geography, are particularly sensitive to the need to achieve the greatest possible diversification and rebalancing of the different modes of transport, with particular recognition of the railway."
"Realities such as the Madrid-Paris Talgo or the high-speed lines, which are extremely popular with the Spanish citizens, are testimony to this enthusiasm for modernising the railways."
"But we have not forgotten what it has cost us, and is still costing us, to put an end to the isolation resulting from the single track, from our different gauge of track, to overcome our complex and difficult mountain situation and the challenge of creating a central route through the Pyrenees, which is becoming increasingly urgent in order to reduce the congestion at either extreme, and is therefore crucial to goods transport."
"Hence our interest in an effective improvement to the railways, which is more global and integrated and not restricted to proposing total and definitive liberalisation as a magic potion for resolving every kind of problem forever."
"We know – and the chairman of our committee, Mr Costa, has referred to this authoritatively – that the competitiveness of railways does not just depend on other rebalancing measures, but, to a large extent, on infrastructures, on the interoperability of systems and on specialised personnel; in short, on investments and on support."
"That is why we are lending our support to the trans-European networks."
"Neither do I believe that it is sensible to indulge in a kind of ‘yo-yo’ system: first we liberalise and deregulate and then we intervene once again."
"And that has happened in the case of the Commission’s proposal for quality standards in goods transport."
"We must acknowledge the courage and skill of Mr Zīle, who has worked in the best possible way, given the circumstances, which make this proposal a good candidate for the ‘Better regulation’ that President Barroso and Commissioner Verheugen are offering us so secretively."
"As shadow rapporteur, I must confess that I was totally astounded to discover that neither customers nor companies wanted this type of legislation."
"Perhaps, Commissioner, we should – and I believe that you are sufficiently creative to do this – try to invent other instruments that are genuinely useful in terms of making goods transport by rail more attractive, not just for advocates of conflicts, but, in particular, for its users."
"In short, no, we cannot legislate in relation to goods by rail as we do with other products, as if we were talking about socks."
"With regard to the Sterckx and Savary reports, I would like warmly to acknowledge their timeliness and sense of urgency and the excellent message they send to the citizens."
"On the one hand, we are creating good European professionals, able to drive trains throughout the whole of the Union’s territory and, on the other, we wish to establish, clearly and courageously, the rights and obligations of passengers, with particular attention to passengers with mobility problems, something which will eventually affect all of us."
"Finally, with regard to the report by Mr Jarzembowski, who is always so impulsive and sure of his objectives, which all too often coincide with those of Europe, I must say that I do not believe it to be realistic to seek to overwhelm the Commission’s proposal, and also to involve it in an interinstitutional battle which, as a result of seeking the best, could jeopardise any success."
"We would have preferred to have accompanied the Commission’s realistic and detailed proposal with a healthy majority which sent a clear signal to all of the interlocutors."
"Instead, he has chosen to present his over-the-top proposal, which has provoked opposition from a significant proportion of this House."
"In any event, I still believe that the Commission’s proposal for opening up is the most pragmatic and realistic, provided that it is part of a general framework of creating a European area of transport, in which the railway competes with other modes of transport under equal conditions."
"And that will be achieved through modernisation and investment."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the debates on the Constitutional Treaty over the last few months suggest that the European Union ought to take its citizens’ interests into account when adopting legal provisions."
"It would also be appropriate to review existing legal instruments and assess the consequences of their implementation, including the financial consequences."
"The European Commission proposed liberalising international passenger transport services from 2010."
"In his document, Mr Jarzembowski suggests bringing the date forward by two years, so that liberalisation would begin in 2008."
"This would result in undertakings currently active in Poland or in other new Member States losing a significant part of the market."
"These countries are suffering from under-investment in railway infrastructure and they lack modern rail equipment."
"Regional rail transport has been under-financed too."
"A further reduction of the transitional period for international transport will aggravate the negative effect of the new provisions on transport companies in the new Member States."
"This is because current arrangements for European funding to purchase modern rolling stock for passenger transport are inadequate, and the countries that joined the Union on 1 May 2004 are not in a position to disburse the large sums required themselves."
"Union citizens will benefit from the liberalisation of services in the long term."
"At present, however, it is important to get the technical quality right and the appropriate infrastructure in place."
"This requires the new Member States to undertake some unusually expensive action involving restructuring and investment."
"It is therefore necessary to retain the five-year period proposed by the Commission, so as to allow the conditions for competition on the European transport market to even out."
"We should grant the railway sector sufficient time to revitalise itself."
"Mr President, Commissioner, liberalisation of the market in rail transport services should go hand in hand with a great European venture linking west of Europe to the east, and north to the south by means of a high speed train similar to the TGV."
"That would be the ideal project through which to demonstrate the unity of our continent and the relevance of European institutions, including the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I first want to thank our rapporteurs."
"The railways are needed in Europe."
"We must offer both freight and passengers the opportunity of rail transport as an alternative to the roads."
"Rail transport conserves the environment and is good for our productivity."
"In that case, freight and passengers must be able to travel quickly and smoothly on the railways."
"That is not the case today."
"It is not always so easy to put together a journey from A to B, and freight is often left at the borders."
"In the second railway package, we are opening up the market to freight transport nationally and internationally."
"It was a good decision, but it still has to be put fully into practice."
"As everyone agrees, things are still moving slowly and coming up against a host of problems."
"Should we, however, do as Mr Jarzembowski proposes and open up the railway markets to passenger transport, when the market for freight transport has not yet been successfully opened up?"
"A number of people fear that it will in practice be impossible to get the two things operating together."
"I come from a country in which we have opened up passenger traffic in our own way."
"We have done so not through outright deregulation but in, so to speak, a peculiarly Swedish way."
"We really have seen the opportunities, but we have also seen the difficulties when certain lines are profitable and others are not."
"That is a difficulty if the ambition is to have passenger traffic throughout the country."
"It is important to open up the markets for passengers as well, and I am convinced that we shall in time have a national opening-up of passenger traffic too."
"What, now, I want, however, to recommend is that we begin with passenger traffic."
"What we also have here are proposed protective clauses for local and regional passenger rail services."
"The fact is that to decide at this stage about opening up passenger traffic would merely be a case of the European Parliament adopting an idealistic position without its being aware of the consequences."
"Mr President, as the Chairman responsible for Traffic in the Intergroup on Sustainable Development, I welcome each community-level law and programme that contributes to the development of railway networks and promotes environmentally friendly traffic."
"With respect to the third rail package, we have to take note of the fact that the railway networks and their development greatly differ in the various member countries."
"Whereas in Western Europe the length of high speed tracks reaches 6 000 km, the railway networks in Eastern areas are mostly neglected and run-down."
"This makes the issue of liberalisation, the opening up of national railway networks to the railway companies of other Member States a complicated one for the East-Central European observer."
"On the one hand, competition inevitably brings about better services and a more satisfying customer experience."
"This makes the railway a more attractive option and reduces road congestion, which is a desirable outcome, to be supported for its positive environmental effects."
"On the other hand, however, Eastern railway companies have been underfinanced for decades."
"Correcting development policy errors and concepts would take a long time and an enormous amount of money; not a task to be reasonably concluded by 2008 or 2012."
"This creates the dangerous possibility that the railway companies of several Member States, including my own, may go bankrupt due to the unfair competition, which would put a severe social, financial and political burden on the respective governments."
"As a representative of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I naturally stand for competition in this area."
"I stand for competition that serves the interest of citizens and the environment at the same time."
"However, in this case we would not be talking about fair competition but the prevalence of dominant companies."
"For this reason I cannot support the proposal of the Committee in its present form and I ask that it be reconsidered."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate all of the rapporteurs on their competent work."
"In the context of this so-called – and I do mean ‘so-called’ – third package, I should like to focus on two dossiers: firstly, the directive on the certification of train crews and, secondly, the directive on liberalisation."
"Firstly, with regard to the report by my colleague and friend Mr Savary, I must say that it is particularly important to adopt this proposal for a directive."
"I actually see this dossier as belonging to the second railway package and, since rail-freight services have already been liberalised, it is imperative to create harmonised European conditions for train drivers and the whole on-board train crew."
"This directive could also contribute significantly towards making a lasting improvement in safety, and it is desirable that it be implemented as quickly as possible."
"As Mr Jarzembowski is probably aware, I have considerable reservations about the content of his report, and my view is still that we are on the wrong track here."
"I am not opposed to it in principle, but it should be noted that liberalisation is not, as yet, known to have had any positive impact, whether on safety, on quality, or on the social situation of crews."
"No suitable framework has been created for conditions of competition throughout the network, and there is no guarantee that quality and efficiency will increase."
"The bad experiences of those countries that have already done this do have to be taken into account, too."
"If Parliament really takes this path tomorrow, it will find itself on the path already described by a late Austrian cabaret artist, who said ‘I don’t know where I’m going, but the main thing is I get there soon’."
"I certainly agree with Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Rack that this time scheduling of legislative resolutions is not exactly the most sensible thing for Parliament to do."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, being more environmentally-friendly, safer and more cost-effective, rail transport ought to be used more by both European business and private users."
"Nevertheless, according to various documents, especially the White Paper, rail transport’s market share appears to be in serious, worrying decline."
"Our aim should therefore be to reverse the trend, by working towards building a competitive and open rail market."
"This is what we are once again trying to do carefully, resolutely and, of course, in line with the rules. We are seeking to grant Member States the right to restrict the opening up of the network in certain cases, whilst respecting the rights of the workers, thus ensuring the safety and quality of the service provided."
"The truth is that blocking the passenger rail transport market to various operators from the Member States cannot be justified by simple protectionism, often on the part of state monopolies. This does not benefit users in any way, shape or form."
"Yet in this rail package there are other issues that merit more detailed analysis."
"Firstly, we feel that cabotage services should fall under future legislation. We welcome the fact that the process of opening up the networks is to be staggered in order to make it easier for those involved to adjust, and this could be extended for the reasons explained by a number of speakers."
"Secondly, without prejudice to the Member States’ responsibilities, powers to issue certification for international train drivers and other on-board staff should also be defined in order to promote the safety and the free movement of workers."
"Lastly, I turn to the issue of the differences between the rights and obligations of national and international passengers."
"In our view, the directive should apply to both in order to make the system simpler and more coherent."
"To conclude, we are, broadly speaking, in favour of this legislative package. For this reason, I should also like to thank the rapporteurs and to express my hope that the package will be adopted in Parliament and in the Council."
"As has been said before, this is an opportunity that must not go to waste."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to commend the Commission for taking the initiative to present this third rail package. I should also like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent reports and the Members of this House who helped to enrich the proposals aimed at revitalising rail transport by creating an internal rail transport market, thereby increasing competitiveness and economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU."
"Although this is a package, each of its parts will be judged on its own merits."
"I welcome the position taken by the Committee on Transport and Tourism as regards the Zīle report and, as a whole, I endorse the reports, in particular the Savary report, for its social and safety elements, and the Sterckx report."
"As regards the Jarzembowski report, I should like to say that I welcome the idea of opening up the market for international passenger transport services in principle, but I have reservations and indeed objections with regard to his intention to bring forward the liberalisation of international transport, including cabotage and, worse, the liberalisation of national transport services from 1 January 2012."
"Liberalising international transport may indeed help to revitalise rail transport in the Union, by boosting growth and creating a better balance in relation to air and road transport."
"It is also true, however, that a somewhat hasty and scarcely harmonious liberalisation could have a terrible impact on some countries such as Portugal, in which specialised infrastructures such as high-speed links have yet to set out and implement their management model and in which the provision of public services in the area of transport will continue to play a key role in terms of employment, economic growth and responsiveness to users."
"Furthermore, no review of Regulation 1191/69, on action by Member States concerning the obligations inherent in the concept of a public service, has taken place. Accordingly, there is neither the necessary legal certainty, nor safeguards of provision in public service obligations in the area of liberalised transport."
"Even if we are able to overcome these doubts regarding national transport and cabotage, we feel that establishing 1 January 2012 as the date for the liberalisation of national transport services is unacceptable, which is why we are seeking a rethink whereby the final say on the matter is left to the Member States."
"Mr President, I would like to begin with stating that I fully agree with the tabling of the rail package and with the principle of liberalisation, since I believe that it leads to more efficient railways that will attract customers."
"This is also significant for passenger services, to encourage passengers to leave the roads and travel by rail."
"Naturally, the expansion of economies of scale is also necessary."
"That is all well."
"What I see as a problem, and I would like to commend it to the attention of Mr Jarzembowski, is the specific macroeconomic challenge the new Member States are faced with."
"Namely, there is huge pressure on these states to introduce the euro, and a constant pressure from cofinancing sources to start our first three-year programme."
"We have to participate in agricultural financing, as our own budgetary contribution is a prerequisite to receiving direct support."
"This enormous pressure to enter the euro zone as soon as possible forces these governments to tackle the issue of budgetary consolidation."
"That in turn makes them ignore the large national companies outside the national budget, such as the national railway companies."
"Accordingly, I think that at this time it is impossible for us to accept the liberalisation schedule he proposes for new Member States, and especially cabotage."
"I suggest that we establish a transition period that allows us time to prepare, to give a chance to our national railway company, especially considering the fact that the new Member States are very large ‘transit chunks’ and huge transit markets."
"We must grant them equal opportunities!"
"This is the reason the accession contract contains transition periods up to 2007 for goods traffic."
"The public services sector is also underdeveloped."
"I fear that we would be left with secondary railway lines operating at a loss, with all the main lines taken over by the large railway corporations."
"This is another reason why I ask that we consider the introduction of some kind of a transition period."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, efforts to enable the revitalisation of Europe’s railways began back in 1994."
"The third railway package now concludes our legislative efforts."
"The current proposal decided, and decides, on the necessary harmonisation in the technical, administrative and, partly, the social field, along with the gradual liberalisation of all railway services by 2012."
"This puts in place the preconditions for a European railway culture, with which the railways can regain their significance and competitiveness within the pan-European transport system."
"The liberalisation efforts in rail transport are not prompted by ideological convictions, but by necessity in terms of transport policy."
"They owe their existence to the fact that the internal market, the European Economic Area and also the European cultural area need the railways as a mode of transport that does not operate only in separate part-markets."
"Particularly on the long, cross-border sections, the railways have inherent systemic advantages."
"This comprehensive reorientation is the only way of countering the heavy losses in terms of transport volume suffered by the railways: in favour of the roads in the case of freight transport, and in favour of the low-cost airlines as well as the roads in the case of passenger transport."
"It is understandable that some employees should feel anxious about such a radical change."
"Yet the 18 years that have elapsed between 1994 and 2012 serve to guarantee that it has been, and continues to be, possible to carry through all these changes in a socially viable way."
"In anticipation of the passenger-rail market organisation, the ICE 3 was approved for France last week, and the TGV will probably follow in the coming year."
"There will then be direct high-speed trains from Paris to South Germany."
"Those responsible have read the signs of the times."
"Adopting the third railway package would mean that we, too, had read the signs of the times."
"In order to proceed with further revitalisation of the railways, we must put on our agenda the full harmonisation of the conditions of competition between the various modes of transport, finding new sources of finance for the rail infrastructure, and particularly a strategy for improving integration of modes of transport as intermodal passenger transport."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank Mr Jarzembowski, the rapporteur, very much for his detailed report on the liberalisation of national railways."
"The report is particularly important for the new Member States."
"As a Polish Member of the House, I should briefly like to share two reactions with you."
"To start with, I would remind the House that the first two railway packages have not yet been fully implemented in certain Member States."
"In addition, there has been no detailed assessment of these packages."
"All this significantly hinders discussion on the Third Railway Package."
"Secondly, as regards the Third Railway Package, I am convinced that it is largely based on the experiences of the old Member States, and that it does not take account of the situation in the new countries."
"In particular, I have in mind Mr Jarzembowski’s report, in which the date for liberalisation of passenger transport services is set at 2008, two years earlier than had been advocated in the Commission’s proposal."
"In addition, in Mr Jarzembowski’s report the scope of liberalisation is broadened to include cabotage."
"Anyone who is acquainted with the current situation of passenger transport in the new Member States will realise that such measures would be very detrimental."
"It should be borne in mind that the new Member States are far less competitive that the old ones, and that in general they lack modern rolling stock and suffer from under-investment in rail infrastructure and from under-funding of regional transport services."
"Consequently, broadening the scope of liberalisation and speeding it up is bound to destabilise the already perilous position of the new Member States, particularly as the Commission has failed to provide adequate funding from Union resources for the purchase of new rolling stock for passenger transport."
"Railway undertakings in the new Member States are not in a position to disburse such large sums themselves."
"It follows from what I have just said that it is likely that the strong will end up dominating the weak, and I do not believe that the Union should be built on such a basis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Union is not about domination. Indeed, the opposite is the case, the Union is all about acting together in solidarity for the benefit of a single strong Europe whose Member States are not categorised in terms of their strength or weakness."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider these three proposals on passenger transport, as they have emerged from the debate and with the amendments approved by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, to be fairly well-balanced."
"In my view, it is clear that rail services must leave room for public services, with well-defined obligations set out in public service contracts, while the remainder of the market operates on the basis of regulated competition with uniform standards for all."
"However, this is the problem, Commissioner, because we need a rapid approval of the regulation on public service obligations."
"It is an age-old question."
"As you know, the Commission has presented a new draft that Parliament has not yet discussed and in which, unless I am mistaken, there is no reference to uniform quality standards."
"Such standards are only mentioned in connection with public service, not for all the rest."
"I should not like to think that the Commission’s political viewpoint had shifted from the direction indicated in 2002, or from that confirmed in the debate here in Parliament and in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"We must therefore ensure that liberalisation can be viewed for what I believe it really is, namely a useful means of improving the quality of services, and also of stimulating development, with respect for territory and the environment."
"This aspect is fundamental and Parliament must again take responsibility for it."
"I therefore invite the Commission to take account of our work in Parliament and of the amendments approved."
"I also urge the UK Presidency to promote a high-level political agreement on this issue in the December Transport Council, making it clear that a truly European transport model is viable."
"I should first like to endorse what Mr Rack said."
"It is worth pointing out that in this House we devote the hours of daylight to making fine-sounding statements, and then late at night we get down to changing legislation which impacts on everyday life in Europe."
"I would like to reverse this order so we debate legal provisions in the full light of day with a good attendance."
"It would be delightful to debate and delight in Mr Jarzembowski’s excellent report if it were not for the fact that it cannot be debated in a vacuum."
"The context is crucial, and it involves more than French animosity towards Polish plumbers, butchers or bakers."
"There is also the matter of resistance to the Services Directive or delocalisation within the Union."
"Small undertakings in local European markets are being driven out to make way for a cavalcade of European locomotives transporting thousands of passengers who will pay for their tickets in euro, not in zlotys."
"We are supposed to be delighted about this, because after all we are supposed to be in favour of opening the market, are we not?"
"There is another context to bear in mind too, namely the technical state of Polish railways."
"We have not had the time or the money to make up for years of neglect."
"It is a foregone conclusion that we shall lose out in the liberalisation of transport."
"It is a battle in which we are bound to have to beat retreat."
"Once again, we are supposed to do so with a smile on our faces, because after all we are supposed to be in favour of opening the market, are we not?"
"Solidarity or at the very least, a reasonable balance, figure hardly at all in all this."
"Please excuse me, when I confess that I am still unsure how I will vote tomorrow."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, we are in favour of the liberalisation of international rail passenger transport, provided it is a necessary means of invigorating rail transport by promoting competition in order to create a modern and genuine internal market."
"Nonetheless, we have certain reservations about Mr Jarzembowski's report."
"We are in favour of a more gradual liberalisation of international passenger transport."
"We consider that the date of 2008 proposed in the report is premature, which is why we consider the date of 2010 proposed by the Commission to be more realistic."
"As regards the rights of railway companies to carry passengers between stations within the same Member State on an international passenger route, we believe that it is preferable for this to be applied from 2010 onwards."
"We also have particular reservations as regards the liberalisation of national transport, which is why I believe that the amendments making provision for the liberalisation of national transport by 2012 should not be adopted."
"We also consider it very important for the Member States to have the facility to restrict access to a route which is governed by a public service contract, where this is necessary in order to maintain the economic equilibrium of the route."
"Despite any differences we may have, we shall vote in favour of the proposal, because we believe that liberalisation may help upgrade passenger rail transport."
"As regards the report by Mr Savary on the certification of train crews, we consider that it is very important that this report be adopted as quickly as possible, given that there must be safety in rail transport, especially in the run-up to the full liberalisation of freight transport."
"Finally, as regards passenger rights, we agree with the report, especially as regards facilitating access for people with disabilities to trains and railway stations, but without exceptions: it must apply everywhere, for both domestic and European transport."
"Mr President, it is my conviction that the third rail package is an important finishing stage in the creation of a common European railway transport services system."
"I agree with the principles set forth in the directives of the third package."
"I support that the overall principles required to open up the European market of passenger services be implemented in national law by 2006."
"Hungary, a new Member State, has already done that."
"I support that Member States should be able to decide, even on a reciprocal basis, to give earlier access to their railway infrastructure."
"This is definitely a case for a multi-speed Europe."
"However, if some Member States wish to decide to open their markets a few years later, they must be allowed this option."
"This is currently missing from the regulation, while at the same time the proposal is going deeper, opening up the market for national passenger services."
"That, however, will raise challenges for a number of Member States, including certain new Member States, that will take time to tackle: public services contracts, solutions for under-serviced areas, logistical tasks and the restructuring of railway companies with all the personnel consequences involved."
"These tasks are not merely a question of a simple national parliamentary decision – they require time."
"We have to realise that, while new Member States show a faster rate of economic development than most traditional Member States, there are some areas where we progress at a slower pace."
"Rail services hold values in new Member States, values that may fall victim to an overly swift transformation."
"These values are not only national in nature but, with the implementation of the third rail package, which I support, will also become common European values."
"I am asking Parliament to consider this during the voting procedure tomorrow."
"– Before the Commissioner replies, a number of colleagues have made reference to the importance of the legislation and the timing of this debate."
"One of my responsibilities as Vice-President is to cover COSAC, the Committee of National Parliaments of the European Union."
"That committee chose the third railway package, some months ago, as the basis for a subsidiarity test; in other words, the way in which legislation would be applied by the national legislative bodies."
"It recognises the importance of this."
". Mr President, I agree with what you have just said."
"We have indeed chosen the third railway package as a basis for a subsidiarity test, in other words for the way in which the legislation is applied by national parliaments."
"That shows the importance we attach to this text."
"First of all I shall say a word of thanks to all the speakers to whom I have listened carefully."
"Nonetheless, you will allow me to give thanks to our rapporteurs in particular."
"I noted, in what Mr Savary said, that his report sends a strong signal and contains a fine example of bilateral agreements between branches."
"I noted also, from Mr Sterckx, the idea that passenger rights are likely to promote confidence in the railways among users."
"I thank Mr Zīle for having sought an acceptable compromise and I would like to say to Mr. Jarzembowski that I appreciated his insistence on the fact that opening up to competition should facilitate transfer from road to rail, since that is indeed what we also wish to achieve."
"I shall try to reply, Mr President, without going into all the details."
"First, since I have been asked the question, I should like to remind you that the first railway package has been transposed by all the Member States except two for certain directives."
"Moreover, the Commission has started infringement proceedings in respect of the two Member States concerned."
"For the second package, the Commission is following very closely the process of transposition into national law."
"I would remind you that May 2006 has been set as the date for transposition, except for the opening up of the domestic freight transport market where the date fixed is the end of December 2005."
"Having made these points, I am going to try, without going into all the details, to give you an idea of the Commission’s opinion on the work of Parliament and of the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"I thank the Chairman, Mr Costa, and the members of the Committee on Transport for the thorough work they have done."
"The purpose of a package is to make it possible to place the different texts in relation to each other in order to achieve a balanced, global reform that allows both an opening up of markets, which is beneficial for consumers, and the establishment of a regulatory framework that ensures the safety and rights of citizens."
"I believe that it is all of this, both the opening up to competition and the regulatory framework, that will allow us to reverse the trend so that it favours railways, as Mr Costa has stressed."
"Most of the proposed amendments improve the quality of the legislative proposals. Certain amendments pose a few problems."
"I am nonetheless convinced that we shall find practical solutions to those questions in the course of the legislative process."
"First, I shall begin with the proposal for a regulation on the quality of freight."
"Obviously the Commission will examine carefully the final position of Parliament and of the Council in order to determine the implications."
"I must stress, however, the importance of this text because one has to admit that the situation in the rail freight transport sector has scarcely progressed since the Commission’s proposal in March 2004."
"Thus it is that the punctuality of international combined rail and road transport remains unsatisfactory: 35% of trains are late in 2005."
"Furthermore, according to the European rail sector, in conventional rail transport, less than one contract in three contains a quality clause that provides for compensation in the event of delays."
"From many quarters we have heard the question: why has the Commission proposed this piece of legislation on the quality of freight?"
"The mere fact of having posed the problem has already had a positive effect on the sector."
"Over the last few months, we have witnessed the negotiation of framework agreements between user groups and certain rail undertakings."
"These negotiations have focussed on commitments to quality."
"Of course, I shall take note of what Parliament and the Council decide and, if they confirm their opposition to the choice of legislative instrument, it will be necessary to ask the people involved to find other ways and means of achieving the objective shared by the three institutions: that is, the improvement of the quality of international rail freight transport services by rail."
"This is the way in which we shall achieve a transfer from road to rail."
"That is the first point and, again, I thank Mr Zīle."
"As regards the other proposals, here, in broad outline, is the position of the Commission and, Mr President, I am communicating the detailed positions on each amendment to the Presidency.(1)"
"I shall now come to Mr Savary’s report on the directive on the certification of train crews operating locomotives and trains."
"Most of the amendments seem to us to be moving in the right direction."
"They are evidence, I say quite simply, of high quality work."
"This directive sends a social signal enabling all rail transport personnel to feel involved in the regeneration of this means of transport."
"There are, however, some amendments that pose certain difficulties, such as in the case of finance for training or the obligation to offer refunds in certain instances."
"These give rise to certain reservations on our part because they impinge on labour law, the flexibility of the market and the right to mobility."
"This also applies to the possibility of a temporary dispensation for domestic drivers."
"Your committee proposes that Member States should be able to temporarily disregard the rules applicable to domestic drivers."
"In the eyes of the Commission, allowing such dispensations for whole countries poses some real questions and that is why it is not in favour of it."
"In social terms, we shall have two classes of driver, when, in practice, the categories are not distinct."
"That runs the risk of creating career problems."
"Moreover, in economic terms, States will be obliged to maintain two different sets of legislation, two systems for accreditation and for recognition of trainers."
"In short, one wonders whether this duality will not give rise to additional costs."
"All that, Mr Savary, does not in any way detract from the quality of the work accomplished."
"There are also provisions that apply to other staff, which seems to me legitimate."
"These concern train staff who are not drivers but who are involved in tasks relating to railway transport."
"In spirit your proposal is in line with that of the Commission."
"It is necessary only to make sure that the ‘comitology’ annex is well defined in order to avoid any legal problems."
"Next there is the problem of drivers failing to respect certain conditions once the basic licence and the harmonised complementary certificate have been obtained."
"There are, no doubt, certain rewordings that would be desirable in order to take proper account of the rights and duties of drivers, of employers and of the competent authority."
"Finally, there is the problem of periodic checks."
"The Commission proposes referring to the safety management systems that each railway undertaking has to put in place."
"In this matter it is necessary to find a balance between the requirements that need to be included in the main body of the legislation and those that need to be in an annex."
"I am sorry, Mr President, at this late hour, to bring into the debate a number of very technical points, but that is due to the quality of the work of the Committee on Transport."
"That is what I have to say, then, about this text on drivers’ licences, which, I have noticed this evening, has received Parliament’s very broad agreement."
"I come now to the third report which concerns the proposal to open up the market for international rail passenger services."
"The Commission appreciates Mr Jarzembowski’s report and supports the idea, which several Members have mentioned, of linking this proposal to our amended proposal on public services in land transport."
"Nonetheless, Mr Jarzembowski, we have reservations about the amendments that involve bringing forward the date for opening up international passenger services from 2010 to 2008."
"The Commission is of the opinion that 2010 is a more appropriate date because it is only on that date that most of the required institutional and procedural framework will be in place and properly operational."
"There are the national safety authorities and the rail regulators and there is the work of the European Railway Agency."
"In addition, most of the planned international high-speed lines will not be completed until 2010 and it is on these infrastructures that international passenger traffic will be concentrated in the future."
"Furthermore, the Commission cannot support opening up the domestic passenger market in 2012."
"This proposal seems to us premature and difficult to realise given its great sensitivity."
"The Commission also has difficulty in accepting the amendment that introduces the potential for Member States to anticipate the opening of their market on condition of a reciprocity clause, because such clauses run the risk of being discriminatory on grounds of nationality."
"Be that as it may, the Commission is pleased with Mr Jarzembowski’s report."
"We can accept the amendments it contains subject to certain alterations to the wording."
"I am thinking more precisely of the extension of the standard term for framework agreements for the use of the railway infrastructure or the clarification of the conditions under which the rights of an open access operator might be limited if they come into conflict with rights resulting from a public service contract."
"This is a balanced approach and it respects different national situations."
"That is what I wanted to say about this proposal for a directive."
"I now come to Mr Sterckx’s report on the regulation on international rail passengers’ rights and obligations."
"Since March 2004, the debate on passengers’ rights has made much progress within our institutions."
"Within the Council, an in-depth discussion is about to come to a conclusion."
"The regulation on the civil responsibility of rail companies, incorporated into the new COTIF-CIV agreement of 1999, should finally come into force before the end of the year."
"Mr Sterckx, I should like once again to express to you my gratitude for the work you have accomplished."
"Your concern has been to seek to widen the scope of the regulation and you have proposed extending it to cover national services also."
"I fear, however, that it is not possible to achieve this extension immediately."
"I should like to commit myself to a more in-depth study of this question. We could then return to it at a later stage in the light of the experience acquired by virtue of the application of the regulation on international travel."
"The second point of your report is the application of the COTIF-CIV international framework in relation to civil responsibility."
"The Commission is inclined to respond favourably to your requests. Nonetheless, the regulation of responsibility as defined by COTIF-CIV does not appear to strengthen the position of passengers in the event of an accident, or, at least, not as much as the Commission would have wished."
"Finally, I shall confine myself to two key points for which the Commission would like your support."
"First of all, the obligation to provide passengers with the information they need."
"Mr President, you have illustrated it with the example of integrated tickets over the whole European network."
"The impact analysis on the consequences of opening up the international passenger service market shows that its success depends very much on efficient access to information and tickets."
"European rail passengers must have the right and the possibility of travelling with a ticket that allows them to cross several borders within the European Union."
"For this right to be truly effective, rail companies, including those that are in competition with each other, must cooperate."
"Secondly, as regards the regulations for civil responsibility in the event of accident, there is no doubt that there must be compulsory insurance."
"Making a requirement for minimal cover will ensure fair compensation for passengers in the event of an accident while at the same time keeping a level playing field for rail companies who are facing financial difficulties."
"Anyway, Mr Sterckx, thank you for what you have done for passengers with reduced mobility."
"It is of great importance to me personally."
"What I can tell you is that if, as I hope, Parliament and the Council accept this proposal, I shall make it my personal responsibility to see to its effective application, because I believe that it is an essential point in terms of giving railways the image of quality that they must acquire."
"So, Mr President, I hope very much that, improved and enriched in this way by Parliament, these texts will also meet the approval of the Council."
"I should like, once more, to thank Parliament."
"We are at a double turning point."
"We are well aware that, for the sake of the environment, but also for the sake of saving energy and because of the risk of congestion on our motorways and roads in Europe, we must encourage this modal transfer, more precisely, this combination between different modes of transport, given that travel by rail, by river and by sea are, without doubt, good options for long distance traffic."
"Moreover, I have heard several Members of Parliament speak about subsidiarity and we are in agreement."
"There are things that should remain within the field of competence of national governments."
"Indeed, it is for this reason that we are going to carry out this subsidiarity test."
"As regards railways, however, ladies and gentlemen, we have come a long way."
"It used to be very much a national, not to say nationalist, area and that prevented the railway from taking its proper place in a Europe that now needs mobility across all our different Member States."
"In this respect, progress had to be made and I am very grateful to Parliament for having allowed us, together, not to reduce the competence of the Union’s Member States, but to show that, in this domain and in the domain of rail transport, the European Union and the drafting of a policy at a European level truly brings added value."
"That is why I warmly thank Parliament and the Committee on Transport for having carried out this in-depth work which will be particularly useful for us in the days to come."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at noon."
"– This report is, in a word, unacceptable."
"Yet again, Parliament is presented with a report intended to speed up the liberalisation of public services – in this case, passenger rail transport – and goes way beyond the Commission’s proposal."
"The proposal, which forms part of what is termed the ‘third rail package’, has been euphemistically dubbed ‘the development of the railways’ and seeks to liberalise international passenger transport by 2010."
"The report goes even further, advocating the liberalisation of international passenger transport (2008), and national transport (2012). What is more, the Member States can bring those dates forward."
"The Commission and Parliament are seeking to press ahead with the process of liberalising and privatising rail transport even before the ‘first’ and ‘second’ packages have been fully implemented and before a progress report has been drawn up of the actual impact of the – let us be clear on this – detrimental measures laid down therein in terms of both the services provided and the working conditions of railway workers."
"The purpose of liberalising the railways is to hand this sector over on a plate to the private sector, leaving the railways subject to the profit imperative, and yet massively subsidised by the Member States."
"In order to defend public rail transport services and the working conditions of those who work on them, we have tabled a motion to reject this directive."

"The next item is the joint debate on the very important issue of Turkey, which includes the Council and Commission statements on the opening of negotiations with that country and the Recommendation by Mr Brok on the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey following the enlargement of the European Union [9617/2005 COM(2005)0191 C6-0194/2005 2005/0091(AVC)] (A6-0241/2005)."
". Mr President, honourable Members, I warmly welcome this debate, which is held at a critical time as the European Union prepares to open accession negotiations with Turkey."
"I have enjoyed my previous exchanges with honourable Members of this House on this topic, and the close and detailed interest that this Parliament maintains in both Turkey's accession process and enlargement issues more generally has further been demonstrated by the questions tabled for Question Time later this evening."
"The December 2004 European Council decision to open accession negotiations brought Turkey's 40-year goal of European Union membership a significant step closer and in the process helped further to bind the country so critical to our future security, stability and prosperity to the Union."
"The strategic case for opening accession negotiations is convincing."
"It includes the powerful incentive for reform and the contribution the process makes to stability and prosperity, the example that it sets to the world that there is no contradiction between Islam and democracy, human rights and the protection of fundamental freedoms, and its contribution to reducing tension in the Aegean and over Cyprus."
"The June European Council confirmed the December decision and recognised the importance for the European Union's credibility of observing our existing commitments."
"As Presidency, our task has been to deliver on these commitments and we are working hard to finalise the Council's position in the framework for negotiations in advance of 3 October."
"The enlargement process has had unparalleled success in spreading European values and promoting greater security across the European continent, but it is as much for its own continued success that we must ensure we are scrupulous in ensuring that all the requirements are met."
"As Commission Rehn, who is with us today, has said, the negotiations with Turkey will be the most rigorous yet, reflecting lessons learnt from the previous wave of enlargement."
"They are also expected to take many years to conclude."
"The powerful incentive for reform that enlargement offers to candidates has been strikingly evident in Turkey in recent years."
"The European Commission's 2004 Regular Report on Turkey's progress towards accession noted 'substantial institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards', the reform process having 'clearly addressed major issues and highlighted a growing consensus in favour of liberal democracy'."
"There is much for Turkey still to do in order to reach European Union standards, including on freedom of religion and the implementation of existing legislation, and the Commission will continue to monitor Turkey's progress."
"But it was the impressive track record of European harmonisation reforms to date that prompted the December Council to conclude that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria."
"Indeed, in the same month, this Parliament adopted a resolution supporting the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey 'without undue delay'."
"That December Council set Turkey two further conditions to be met before accession negotiations could be launched: to bring into force six outstanding pieces of legislation which reinforce the rule of law and human rights; and to sign a Protocol extending the 1963 Ankara Agreement to the new Member States."
"The new legislation entered into force on 1 June, and Turkey signed the Ankara Agreement Protocol on 29 July."
"Both represent significant developments."
"The new legislation overhauls the Turkish penal system, aligning it much more closely with European Union models and adds significantly to the reforms that have taken place in Turkey in recent years."
"Signature of the Protocol extends the European Union-Turkey Association Agreement – or Ankara Agreement – to all 25 Member States."
"It is, of course, with 25 Member States that Turkey will conduct its accession negotiations."
"You are all well aware that, when signing the Protocol, Turkey issued a unilateral declaration restating its longstanding position of non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus."
"Last week the European Community and its Member States issued a declaration setting out its position on the issues raised."
"That declaration makes clear that the 'declaration by Turkey is unilateral, does not form part of the Protocol and has no legal effect on Turkey's obligations under the Protocol'. Furthermore, it states that 'Turkey must apply the Protocol fully to all European Union Member States' and that the 'European Union will monitor this closely and evaluate full implementation in 2006'."
"The declaration also restates that the European Community and its Member States 'recognise only the Republic of Cyprus as a subject of international law' and clarifies that 'recognition of all Member States is a necessary component of Turkey's accession process'."
"The Council's declaration also reiterates the agreement of the European Community and its Member States 'on the importance of supporting the UN Secretary-General's efforts to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem in line with relevant UNSCRs and the principles on which the European Union is founded'."
"Resolution of the Cyprus problem lies in the hands of the United Nations and the communities on the island."
"The European Union's role is to support the UN Secretary-General's 'good offices', and to provide a context within which the two parties can re-engage with one another in confidence and accommodate the ultimate agreement."
"Let me make one final point in my introductory remarks to this debate."
"Turkey will not accede to the Union imminently; 35 chapters must be opened and closed; further reforms will be required; and some Member States have already committed to referenda on Turkey's eventual accession."
"The Turkey that will eventually join the European Union will, frankly, be a different Turkey from the one we see today – and it may also be a rather different European Union that it joins."
"But the progress made by Turkey so far has been quite extraordinary and Prime Minister Erdogan's Government remains committed to further reform."
"The conditions laid down by the December European Council have been satisfied, and this paves the way for opening accession negotiations next Monday."
"I am delighted that the Foreign Secretary will appear before this Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs on the following day; he will of course update the members of that committee then on the progress made."
". Mr President, firstly I should like to warmly welcome the new observers of Parliament from Bulgaria and Romania."
"I am glad to see that they are participating in the work of this House and I look forward to working with them in the future."
"This debate about Turkey is certainly very timely."
"We are on the eve of accession negotiations, which will begin next Monday, 3 October, the date unanimously fixed by the European Council."
"This opens a new phase in EU-Turkey relations."
"The reasons which led the European Union to decide to open accession negotiations with Turkey are unchanged: the EU needs a stable, democratic and increasingly prosperous Turkey, at peace with its neighbours, and embracing European values, policies and standards."
"The start of the negotiations will give a strong boost to those in Turkey who want to reform the country to meet the European values of the rule of law and human rights; they are also a way for the EU to exert leverage over the direction of these reforms in Turkey."
"The conditions set in the December European Council conclusions have been met."
"First, the six pieces of legislation, including the new penal code identified as necessary by the Commission in last year’s recommendation, entered into force on 1 June."
"Second, Turkey signed the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement on 29 July."
"In this context, I would like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and rapporteur, Mr Elmar Brok, for putting forward the recommendation to give assent to the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Ankara Agreement."
"I shall now make some comments on recent developments in this regard."
"The Commission regrets the fact that Turkey issued a declaration upon signature of the Additional Protocol."
"This obliged the EU Member States to react and to lay down the obligations we expect Turkey to meet in a statement adopted on 21 September."
"The EU statement stresses that the declaration by Turkey is unilateral, as Mr Alexander very correctly pointed out."
"It does not form part of the Protocol and has no legal effect on Turkey’s obligations under the Protocol."
"This is the crux of the matter."
"The legal services of the Council and the Commission agree fully on this point."
"I am aware that in paragraph 2 of your joint motion for a resolution you intend to ask the Commission to secure an answer from the Turkish Government regarding the ratification process in the Turkish Grand National Assembly."
"I am at your disposal to further inquire about the exact details of the ratification process in Turkey, but the essence of the matter is really that the declaration by Turkey is simply unilateral."
"It has no legal effect and it cannot in any way call into question the full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Protocol."
"That is what counts."
"Secondly, the EU expects full and non-discriminatory implementation of the Protocol, including the removal of all obstacles to the free movement of goods, which also extends to restrictions on means of transport."
"Thirdly, the opening of negotiations on the relevant chapters depends on Turkey’s compliance with its contractual obligations to all Member States; failure to meet these obligations in full will affect the overall progress of the negotiations."
"The fourth element of the statement is that the recognition of all Member States is a necessary component of the accession process; accordingly, the EU underlines the importance of the normalisation of relations between Turkey and all EU Member States, as soon as possible."
"Finally, the statement makes it clear that the European Community and its Member States agree on the importance of supporting the efforts of the UN Secretary-General to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the very principles on which the EU is founded, so that a just and lasting settlement will contribute to peace, stability and harmonious relations on the island and in the region in a broader sense."
"Right before the start of the accession negotiations, the Council should adopt the negotiating framework proposed by the Commission."
"This framework forms a solid basis for rigorous and fair negotiations with Turkey."
"It is the most rigorous framework ever presented by the Commission."
"I have read your joint motion for a resolution carefully."
"I share many of your concerns."
"I also agree that there is an important link between the pace of negotiations, on the one hand, and the pace of political reforms in Turkey on the other."
"I shall spare no effort to repeat time and again that starting accession negotiations marks only the beginning of a very demanding and complex process."
"Turkey will need to continue and accelerate its process of internal transformation and its transition towards a fully-fledged liberal democracy respectful of human rights and minorities."
"Turkey’s reform process is ongoing."
"The human rights situation has improved, but significant efforts are still required."
"First, let us look at the brighter side."
"Recently, there have been some encouraging signals."
"The acknowledgment by Prime Minister Erdogan of the existence of a 'Kurdish issue' is a landmark."
"His trip to Diyarbakir suggests the importance the government in Turkey attaches to the economic and social development of south-east Turkey."
"Moreover, the academic conference on the Armenian issue was finally able to be held in Istanbul last weekend, with the support of the government and despite last-minute attempts to cancel it by an administrative court."
"These attempts were strongly condemned by Prime Minister Erdogan and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Gül."
"This is a major step forward in seeking the historical truth in Turkey on this very sensitive issue."
"Turning now to the darker side, despite the efforts of the authorities, implementation on the ground remains uneven."
"On the one hand, there are signs that the judiciary is enforcing the reforms."
"Several positive court judgments have been made in relation to cases of freedom of expression, freedom of religion and the fight against torture and ill-treatment."
"On the other hand, there have been contradictory decisions, particularly in the area of freedom of expression where, for example, journalists continue to be prosecuted and, on occasion, convicted, for expressing certain non-violent opinions."
"The case of the author, Orhan Pamuk, is emblematic of the difficulties faced in ensuring effective and uniform implementation of these reforms and also of the struggle between reformers and conservatives in Turkey."
"The novelist was prosecuted by a district judge in Istanbul under Article 301 of the new penal code for 'denigrating Turkish identity'."
"The Commission has already made it very clear that its assessment of the new penal code, in particular the doubtful provisions relating to freedom of expression, will depend on how these provisions are implemented."
"The prosecution of Mr Pamuk raises serious concerns in this respect."
"If this is indeed the direction taken by the judiciary in Turkey, then the Turkish penal code will have to be amended so as to ensure that freedom of expression is no longer subject to the very particular beliefs of a district judge, but simply follows European standards as we all know them, on the basis of the European Convention of Human Rights."
"On these issues the Commission will continue to monitor closely the progress towards fully meeting the Copenhagen political criteria."
"We shall make a detailed analysis of that progress in our regular report, to be adopted on 9 November."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has reached a crucial point, the importance of which should not be underestimated."
"By opening accession negotiations with Turkey, we are taking out a strong option on the pursuit of the political, economic and social transformation of that country."
"In doing so, we respect our commitments towards it."
"I address both to Europeans and, in particular, to Turkey the message that we must build relations founded on mutual confidence."
"I have confidence that the Turkish Authorities will embark upon this journey with an open mind and that 3 October will provide the opportunity to start afresh."
"Demonstrating a commitment unburdened by ambiguities and ulterior motives towards Turkey’s transformation into a democratic country with European values will undoubtedly be Turkey’s best chance of winning over the support of public opinion in Europe."
"During this forthcoming period, Turkey will have the opportunity to demonstrate that it is serious about integrating European values."
"Countries that wish to join the Union must, in fact, share our vision of Europe and our concepts of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and solidarity."
"They must also share our standards whether they relate to society, the environment or industry, among other areas."
"If it is the case that the European Union is taking a gamble on their future accession, it is because we also believe that it is in our best interests and that it will benefit our fellow citizens."
"I undertake personally before this House to rigorously enforce our criteria and conditions."
"Finally, Mr President, as I said previously, the journey is just as important as the final destination."
"The reforms count."
"Although the common goal of the negotiations is membership, such negotiations are, by their very nature, open as far as the outcome is concerned."
"However, it is in our mutual interest that this process is structured around clear and rigorous principles, such as those provided for in the framework of the negotiations."
"That is the best guarantee of success."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the additional protocol, like so many other issues around the beginning of negotiations with Turkey, raises what is very much a point of principle, that being the question of whether a candidate for accession is willing to accept all the parts of that entity of which it desires to become a member, or, to put it another way, whether it recognises all the Member States."
"In December last year, the Commission put to the Council the proposition that recognition in international law was not necessary at the present time, but that the signature of the additional protocol on customs union between the EU of 25 and Cyprus would be sufficient."
"Turkey did comply with this requirement, albeit with a unilateral declaration that made it at least questionable whether the protocol would be implemented."
"The Council responded to this with a statement to the effect that this was quite simply not valid in either political or legal terms."
"Our Committee, though, asked the Commissioner, orally on 13 September and in writing on 15 September, to make his good offices available to us, and he agreed to do so."
"To date, we have had no response to the question as to whether the Turkish Government intends to include this unilateral declaration in the process of ratification by that country’s parliament."
"The fact is that, as and when this is made something that the Turkish parliament needs to ratify, thereby making Turkey’s non-implementation of it a matter of law, that presents us with a problem."
"I therefore invite you, before we proceed to the vote, to provide the Committee on Foreign Affairs with the statement it has requested, and which is mentioned in the joint resolution."
"We should make it clear that it is Turkey that is asking to join the European Union and not – contrary to the impression I sometimes get – we who are inviting it to join us."
"We must not lose sight of the fact that the joint statement, as submitted by the groups, attaches a great deal of importance to the additional protocol actually being put into effect."
"If we are to address this problem, we would be well advised to negotiate the chapter on customs union by 2006 at the latest and conclude negotiations on it by the end of that year, in order that this issue – which also has a bearing on the recognition of Cyprus – can be speedily resolved and that we do not end up negotiating with Turkey without the prospect of this fundamental issue being resolved."
"For that reason, we agree with the Commissioner and the President-in-Office that we will need, in future, to again avail ourselves of the good offices of the United Nations in order to resolve the Cyprus conflict as a whole."
"Perhaps I might be permitted a few personal observations."
"Yesterday, somebody asked me why it is that torture in Turkey – of which there are thousands of instances – is not a fit subject for debate, while an unresolved issue about a general can stand in the way of negotiations with Croatia."
"I have to admit that I was unable to come up with an answer to that."
"We should be honest in the way we do politics, taking care not to use arguments as pretexts for our own subjective political ends; instead, we need to be very clear and honest in stating where we stand on this issue."
"One reason why the resolution submitted by the groups in this House is so important is that we also need to make it clear that one criterion that must be met is the European Union’s capacity for absorbing new Member States – both as an end in itself, and because it raises questions about what is financially possible, what is actually practicable, and what the institutions are capable of handling."
"I would like to see the Council and the Commission, in these weeks and months, apply to the period of reflection on the Constitution the same consistent effort that they are devoting to Turkey’s accession."
"Then we might make some headway on this issue of absorbency."
"We must not lose sight of the fact – which the groups’ resolution makes clear – that it is for us in this European Parliament to state that the conditions are formally met – in contrast to their form of words, which refers to ‘sufficiently fulfilled’ – and that issues of minority rights, issues relating to the processes of reform within Turkey, and the freedom of religion issue have a major part to play in this."
"This summer, the Commissioner exchanged letters with the Turkish foreign minister on the subject of the Law on Foundations, in the course of which the foreign minister rejected the improvements that the Commissioner had suggested, and stated that such things were a matter for the parliament, and then only after 3 October."
"Issues of pluralism, tolerance and freedom of religion, not to mention the right of the Orthodox Church to train its own priests, which it has been unable to do since 1971, are, after all, issues of substance touching on the European Union’s understanding of its own values and should be given prominence in the early months of the negotiating process."
"As I see it – and this is true of Turkey and of many other countries – the prospect of membership of the European Union has an important part to play in these areas."
"It exerts crucial leverage in getting internal reform processes going in such countries as those in the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Turkey, and it is for that reason that we should never shut the door on them."
"We also, however, need to be realistic and open-minded, not only about the results we expect from negotiations, but also about the ends we have in view."
". Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, scarcely any political issue has such far-reaching implications for the existence of the European Union as the possibility of Turkey becoming a member of it."
"Being a major issue, opinions differ as to what is to be done about it."
"Speaking on behalf of my group, and having been one of the signatories to the joint motion for a resolution, let me say that, on so fundamental an issue as this, we do of course allow every one of our members to vote in whichever way they choose, because this is an issue on which every single member of our group has their own opinions, not only because we allow them to, but because it is our profound conviction that they should."
"That is why different members of our group can be found taking up different positions on this subject."
"We do, however, agree on one thing, and it is for that reason that we have been able to give the motion for a resolution our unanimous backing, that being that both parties to the negotiations on Turkey must see them as open-ended as regards their outcome."
"We want to stress that we all have an interest in democracy, the rule of law, and human rights in Turkey developing in such a way that they are brought closer to our values."
"Even if Turkish accession is not the ultimate objective, or even if, at the end of this process, Turkey does not become a Member State, we can, today, tell our Turkish friends and partners that it is still very much in our interests to seek a close alternative partnership that will put partnership, cooperation and friendship with Turkey on a sound footing."
"Having listened to all that has been said by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, let us not mince our words: we are dancing around as if on eggshells, with statements being issued by this party and that, by Turkey on the one hand and the Council on the other."
"As Mr Brok has reminded us, Commissioner, you gave the Committee on Foreign Affairs an undertaking that you would attempt to get the Turkish Government to make a statement to the effect that its non-recognition of Cyprus and its refusal to let Cypriot ships or aircraft dock or land on Turkish soil was not an issue in the process of ratification by Turkey."
"That declaration has not been forthcoming."
"If we do not get from you such a declaration, in which Turkey assures you that these matters will not feature in the ratification process by noon today, then our group will move that approval of the protocol be deferred, for it is logical – both politically and inherently – that there should be no vote on this until such time as such a declaration from the Turkish Government is in our hands."
"Let me ask a very serious question: how do things stand as regards human rights?"
"I suggest you go and ask the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew."
"Where the freedom of Christians to practise their religion in Turkey is concerned, nothing has changed."
"We, in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are all in favour of partnership, friendship and dialogue with the Islamic world, but that cannot be a one-way street."
"Islam, too – meaning, in this instance, the Turkish Government – must be willing to acknowledge the legitimate rights of Christians in Turkey and to give that practical expression."
"That is something that worries me."
"I am addressing the President-in-Office of the Council – who will, I hope, pay attention – when I say that I call on the British Government to apply the same standards across the board."
"We know what the human rights situation in Turkey is like, but what about Croatia?"
"We are refusing to begin negotiations with Croatia on the grounds that this general is not being handed over, even though it is patently obvious that the government is not in a position to do that."
"For Turkey, though, almost all of us close our eyes and apply different yardsticks."
"I urge you, for the sake of your own credibility, to apply uniform standards and treat Croatia, too, fairly and objectively."
"This is very important, and we urge the Commission to do it."
"Although it can always rely on our support, we will also take a highly critical line if there is no improvement in the human rights situation within a specified period of time after negotiations with Turkey begin."
"We know that torture is still going on."
"If a stop is not put to it, we must also be ready to defer negotiations."
"We must not pass over these violations of human rights in silence."
"That brings me to the last point I want to make: it is a very important one, and I shall quote from our joint resolution, which I signed along with Mr Eurlings and Mr Brok, whom I want to thank warmly for jointly leading the negotiations on behalf of our group."
"Paragraph 16 of it states that the Treaty of Nice is not an acceptable basis for further decisions on the accession of any further new Member States and that Parliament therefore insists that the necessary reforms be brought into force within the framework of the constitutional process."
"What that means is that it is not just Turkey that must meet the conditions for accession."
"That is a hard and tricky road to go down, and we hope that Turkey will go down the road that leads to democracy, to the rule of law and to human rights."
"We too, the European Union, must be certain that we can cope with an accession."
"If that is not the case, then it is irresponsible to keep on enlarging this European Union of ours, for we will end up with something that is no longer the European Union."
"Here, at the heart of the European Union, let us do what has to be done to make this European Union strong and effective."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, listening attentively to Mr Poettering, there is only one conclusion to which one can come, and that is that it would be better if he were to say that he and his group do not want Turkey as a full member of the European Union."
"That is the message contained in his speech, so let him say so, rather than pussyfooting around the issue."
"If he does not want Turkey to be a full member of the European Union, then let him say so."
"His group’s website includes pages full of some of its members saying that very thing."
"That is the point at issue and that is what he is fighting shy of."
"Let me tell you what our group wants."
"It has been decided by the Heads of State or Government, 18 of whom are Mr Poettering’s political allies, that 3 October is to be the day on which the accession negotiations are to be kicked off; they will take between ten and fifteen years and are not a free ride, for their conditions have been proposed by the Commission and defined by the Council, and it is these that we are discussing today."
"Let me name a couple of conditions that are indispensable."
"If Turkey wants to join the European Union, there are fundamental conditions with which it must comply."
"One thing on which we do agree is that a country cannot seek membership of the European Union while not recognising one of its Member States; that is impossible."
"We therefore argue that the commencement of negotiations cannot be conditional upon recognition, but recognition must be forthcoming at some point during their course."
"We also want to make it clear that we cannot wait until the end of a fifteen-year process for it; it must happen at once, at some point in the first or second year, and if the protocol to which Mr Brok referred is not put into effect, which means that Cyprus is not recognised, then the accession negotiations will have to be suspended."
"Delighted though I am that Mr Poettering agrees with us about this, I ask the House to hold the applause a moment or two longer, for there is more to come."
"If you want to enlarge the European Union, you have to make it fit for enlargement."
"That is something else on which we agree, and this joint resolution says so."
"If Mr Poettering wants to be better understood, he will have to be very precise in the language he uses."
"If the European Union does not have the capacity to cope with Turkey’s accession, then it cannot cope with Croatia’s either."
"I can tell Mr Poettering what his group, by its policy, is saying: it is saying that it does not want Turkey because Turkey is distant and Muslim, but that Croatia is acceptable on the grounds of being Catholic, conservative and close at hand."
"That is what his group’s policy adds up to: hypocrisy and nothing more!"
"It is not acceptable to string a candidate country along for 40 years with promises of EU membership; it is not acceptable to demand of such a country that it put itself through processes of transformation that it has already undergone."
"Under no conservative government – whether that of Mrs Çiller or that of Mr Poettering’s great mate Mr Yilmaz – has Turkey made such progress towards democracy as it has done under Mr Erdoğan."
"So let me spell out the fact that the increase in security that could result from Turkey’s full membership is not to be underestimated."
"We cannot, however – and I include my own group in this – be naive and say that it can join tomorrow."
"Its accession is dependent on conditions, and those conditions apply to both parties."
"Turkey must comply with them, and so must the European Union. This debate could do with a bit more honesty."
"If you find Turkey unacceptable, then you should say so openly."
"We want to give it the chance, but we do not know whether its accession will, at the end of the day, be possible, for there are reforms to be implemented by both countries, by both parties."
"You in particular should be more reticent, Mr Langen."
"I have a clear recollection of December 1995, when this House’s most eloquent advocate of accession was none other than your good self, and that makes you one of our leading hypocrites."
"Let me tell you, I have a good memory, and shouting the odds does nothing to make your arguments less false."
"I ask Members to give some thought to the fact that the European Parliament ..."
"Wait a moment please, Mr Schulz."
"Mr Langen, you do not officially have the floor and I would therefore ask you not to speak."
"Please calm down and be quiet."
"Mr President, perhaps you would be so kind as to have Mr Langen’s comment of ‘What a liar!’ recorded in the Minutes."
"I would be grateful if that at least could be done."
"It is apparent from the uproar among the Christian Democrat Members how hard it is to bear when one is publicly caught out."
"Let me tell the House what our group regards as important."
"We have, of course, had the same debate that Mr Poettering describes as having gone on in his own outfit."
"In my outfit too, by which I mean our group, there is more than one opinion, but I do want to return to paragraph 16 of our joint resolution, because it was evident from Mr Poettering’s speech that we will soon have to debate Croatia."
"The same fundamental preconditions apply to Croatia too: cooperation with the International Court is a ."
"It is clear from paragraph 16, though, that another fundamental precondition for any enlargement is that the European Union should have a constitution."
"If that constitution is not the one that is proving unacceptable in its present form, then let me make it quite clear that enlargement needs more than just Nice and a few adjustments to it."
"If the European Union is to be made fit for enlargement, we must keep on demanding a constitution for it, we must maintain that as our goal."
"That applies in the case of Turkey, but let there be no misunderstanding: it also applies in the case of any other candidate for accession."
"I should also like to know whether Mr Poettering would insist just as enthusiastically on these two conditions being coupled together if this debate were about Croatia."
"I look forward to seeing whether he will, in that event, be just as passionate in demanding compliance with fundamental preconditions as he has been demanding it of Turkey."
"That is a day to which I look forward."
"I will sum up by saying that we, as a group, will be voting in favour of the resolution."
"As regards the adjournment that Mr Brok envisages in the event of the answer not reaching us by midday today, let me say that, if Turkey really does put that on the agenda for the ratification debate in its parliament, then the result will be precisely what we have specified in the joint resolution."
"The negotiations will then have to be suspended, perhaps even deferred, so an adjournment will not be necessary."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whenever we talk about Turkey the debate, of course, becomes political straight away, regardless of the more or less legal reason for the debate, as is happening now."
"All the groups have signed an important compromise document together, putting forward a united position, but we have also sacrificed a number of points of correctness for the sake of this unity."
"In my view, the document is extremely harsh in the demands it makes on Turkey, and such an approach does not even encourage the Greek Cypriots to be more flexible or for them too to seek a solution to this situation, for which they are largely responsible."
"We must not forget who rejected the referendum; we must not forget the reasons why we are in this situation."
"I am saying this just to show how things stand."
"A country that was about to join prevented a European Union Commissioner from speaking on state television, and that Commissioner has said that the Greek Cypriot authorities betrayed his trust and went back on their word."
"I am saying this because we are not doing even our Cypriot friends a favour if we do not demand that they too show a sense of responsibility regarding this situation."
"Lastly, for those who, like us, have belief and hope in a political Europe as a political, economic and moral force, it is clearly a surprise that we ourselves are not delighted at the success that our gentle European influence is having in Turkey. Perhaps we ourselves do not realise that a number of taboos have recently been broken."
"Armenia is being discussed in Turkey and it is being discussed with the support of the government: in spite of everything, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have supported opening this debate."
"The Kurdish taboo has also been broken: one need only recall the Prime Minister’s recent speech on the mistakes made in that area and the fact that they have accepted responsibility for the Diyarbakir intervention."
"These are successes achieved by political Europe, by our capacity for encouraging open, more respectful, democratic structures and systems."
"It is true that we are entitled to be critical, but we are not entitled to be cynical; the early death of the European Constitution on the electoral scaffolds of France and the Netherlands has left the continent without an ideal border for its maturity, leading to a build-up of resentments and cynicism, which do not constitute a policy."
"That is not the way to do politics; that is not the way to create a federalist, liberal policy for the Europe that we want: one that encourages freedom, the rule of law and democracy."
". Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whenever sensible people get so worked up, there has to be something behind it, or else they would not do it."
"There are a couple of things of which we can perhaps remind ourselves."
"Up to now, we have not enlarged the European Union; we have united it."
"The Turkey debate is the first real debate on enlargement, for nobody – irrespective of how they are voting – is describing the accession of Poland, the Czech Republic or Hungary as an enlargement of the European idea; they were a matter of obligation, for it was right and proper to welcome these countries after the collapse of Communism."
"What we are now dealing with really is a new dimension."
"This is about enlargement."
"No matter which way we decide, this is a new dimension."
"Just shut up, will you?"
"We do indeed have a new dimension to deal with, and the question with which it presents us is this: is it, post-9/11, important in terms of Europe’s interests to give Turkey the chance of accession?"
"That question can be answered in different ways, but it must be answered by reference to the interests of the European Union, the interests of the people of Europe, rather than on the basis of emotional, cultural, or racist resentments."
"That is not acceptable and we do not want it!"
"If you are not, if you do not think I mean you, then I do not. In that case, I mean Mr de Villiers."
"Stop thinking that everything refers to you!"
"You are not the centre of the universe!"
"At present, the arguments used in Europe against Turkey rely on feelings, on racist resentments directed against Islam."
"Not all those who are against Turkey use these arguments, but they ride the wave of these sentiments."
"It follows that all those in the ‘no’ camp must ask themselves what their arguments unleash, and it is for that reason that I think it right to argue that Europe needs to change first, that Europe has to do its homework, and that Europe needs a constitution; these are things with which nobody disagrees."
"Europe cannot enlarge itself the way it is now."
"As to whether Europe can, subject to the conditions in the Treaty of Nice, make itself more united by including Croatia, I too have my doubts."
"That is a legitimate debate."
"The other debate, though – the debate about whether Europe can absorb a country whose population is predominantly Muslim – is nonsensical."
"Today, in Europe, there are more Muslims than there are Belgians."
"They are already included among us."
"The question of how European Islam is will arise with Turkey or without it, so let us stop discussing it."
"Islam is the third-largest religion in Europe; whether I, as an atheist, find that to my liking is another matter."
"It is for that reason that the only question to be asked at the end of this debate is what Turkey will be like in ten years’ time. Will it be a democratic state, a secular state?"
"Is Islam European?"
"Will this same Turkey be prepared to join with us Europeans in contending for the values that we enshrine in a constitution?"
"If the answer to those questions is in the affirmative, then I will bid it welcome; if not, then we will have to think up something else."
". Mr President, I would be most obliged to you if you were to use whatever influence you have on Mr Cohn-Bendit to induce him to take some time out to think and thereafter to withdraw the sweeping accusations of racism that he has aimed at those who are opposed to Turkish membership."
"Mr President, I would like to say, for Mr Brok’s benefit, that not all the arguments against Turkey are racist, but that those who can ride the wave of racism in their campaign against Turkey must, for that reason, give some thought to what arguments they use."
"I stand by that."
"If that touches a sore point for you, then that is your problem, and if it does not, then good for you."
"Mr Brok and Mr Cohn-Bendit, we must work in accordance with our Rules of Procedure."
"I imagine that Mr Brok has spoken pursuant to Rule 145."
"He has not said as much, but my interpretation is that he has requested the floor on the basis of that Rule, which stipulates that personal statements take place at the end of the debate in question."
"You may speak, therefore, Mr Brok, if you wish, when we finish this debate."
"Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order."
"I should like to call on Mr Cohn-Bendit to withdraw his remark, which seems extremely serious to me and which is not …"
"Mr de Villiers, since you have not told me which Rule of the Rules of Procedure you are invoking, I have had to cut you off."
". Mr President, on the eve of the opening of these debates, which are scheduled to take place over a long period of time, the matter is one of reiterating very clearly their non-negotiable points, on which Europe’s negotiators therefore cannot compromise, whatever pressures they might be subjected to."
"While people may be familiar with these points, it is not a useless exercise, in my opinion, to reiterate them today."
"Our group has done so in its motion for a resolution."
"In the first instance, it is a question of actually enforcing standards of democracy, as well as actually complying with internationally recognised civil rights and human rights."
"That obviously includes the civil, political and cultural rights of the minorities and, above all, of the Kurds."
"This is an aspect that the draft compromise which has been submitted to us, and which is, moreover, satisfactory overall has surprisingly and regrettably overlooked."
"Well, in our opinion it is vital that Turkey abandon once and for all any notion it might have of solving the Kurdish issue through the use of military force, that it acknowledge the political dimension of the conflict and that it promote reconciliation, particularly with the Kurds who have relinquished the use of their weapons."
"In the same spirit, it is a question of getting Turkey to agree, contrary to any form of nationalism, to look its past in the face by recognising the Armenian genocide."
"It is significant, moreover, that the unacceptable court action brought against Orhan Pamuk should focus at the same time on the Kurdish issue and on the Armenian issue."
"Finally, it is a question of ensuring, within a short timescale that it would be useful to clarify from the first phase of the negotiation, that Turkey recognise the Republic of Cyprus, withdraw its occupying troops from the north of the island and, for the time being, fully implement the commitments contained in the protocol extending the EU-Turkey customs union to the new Member States, in particular the Republic of Cyprus."
"This of course means that Turkey must respect in full the unrestricted access of Cypriot boats and aircraft to its ports and airports."
"Within that list, there are no excessive or unwarranted conditions."
"On the whole, these measures live up to the expectations of Turkey’s democratic forces themselves."
"Like us, they want to create the conditions for their country to join the Union in the future."
"For them – for the Turkish and Kurdish democratic forces – these negotiations constitute an exceptional lever for accelerating the changes that they consider to be necessary."
"Therefore, our vigilance is to their advantage!"
". Mr President, for those of us who are opposed to the whole idea of political union, the matter is quite straightforward."
"We are opposed to political union with Turkey just as we are opposed to political union with Germany, France or Italy."
"However, what is one to make suddenly of all these euro-fanatics – especially down there – and the CDU in Germany, and even the great President Chirac himself, whose ardour for the European Union's endless development suddenly cools when they reach the Bosphorus?"
"Some this morning will detect the whiff of hypocrisy; but it is not actually hypocrisy, it is the smell of fear: fear that public support for the whole EU project will finally collapse if Turkish entry is pursued."
"After all, the latest Eurobarometer, as Mr Poettering will surely know, showed 70% opposition to Turkish membership in France and 74% in Germany."
"But, as usual, Brussels will plough on."
"Good!"
"Although we are against Turkish accession, we shall be quite happy to watch the EU destroy itself while trying to achieve it."
"They say turkeys do not vote for Christmas, but if the EU institutions vote for Turkey, it could be a serendipitous exception to the rule."
". Mr President, each successive enlargement of the European Union triggered a range of emotions, but to date no enlargement has caused as many misgivings amongst Europeans as the one involving Turkey."
"This could mean that Europeans will never consent to it."
"If Europeans oppose this enlargement both now and in the future, creating the mirage of full Turkish membership of the European Union will amount to creating a tremendous disappointment and upset for the government in Ankara."
"When the Turkish issue was first debated in the House in December 2004, I pointed out that it is abundantly obvious that all the advantages of closer economic, political and military ties with Turkey can be gained without full membership."
"Much has been written on this subject."
"I should today like to highlight a further problem linked to this enlargement, namely the loss of political and geographical balance it involves."
"Postponing Croatia’s membership and avoiding a statement on Ukraine’s rightful place in Europe whilst pressing forward with this process for Turkey is painful and unacceptable."
"It is exceedingly costly and damaging to the European Union in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in the other countries I mentioned."
"Mr Schulz and Mr Poettering maintain that our capacity for absorption is limited."
"If so, I would prefer to use this capacity differently."
"The document before us is actually an attempt at blackmail, as it conditions the enlargement process to the so-called constitutional process."
"The Law and Justice Members will therefore abstain in the vote on the aforementioned document."
"Mr President, there is every indication that Turkey will accede whatever the cost, but as the EU/Turkey Civic Commission demonstrated recently, Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria, yet the Commission and Council claim otherwise."
"They know very well what goes on."
"Commissioner Rehn referred a moment ago to the persecution of the author Orhan Pamuk, and they express their concern every time something happens, but when it comes down to it, they do nothing about it."
"When should Turkey recognise all Member States?"
"What is the timetable for opening the Turkish airports and seaports?"
"People suggest during the negotiation process, so in ten years time or so, possibly, for we will of course have made so much progress that we will be unable to back-pedal, even if Turkey does not meet the conditions."
"That is the salami solution: decisions are taken in small chunks and before we know it, we are facing a ."
"The only argument we keep hearing prior to Turkey’s accession is the promise that is being made to the Turks."
"What about the promise that Turkey must meet conditions?"
"In fact, when will we ask the public what they think about the accession of a non-European country that has no place in the European Union?"
"Mr President, just before the planned start to the negotiations, the relationship between Europe and Turkey is going through a very rocky patch, first of all as a result of a counter-declaration from Turkey that the Commission tried to prevent at all costs, but secondly because Turkey’s perception of what would be needed in order to join the European Union is incompatible with the rules of the club."
"They perceive things differently."
"That is why at the moment, what we need, above all else, is clarity – clarity about what the rules are and what should happen, and that is why I welcome our joint resolution, for it is bringing us exactly that."
"It stipulates that the recognition of Cyprus is not negotiable."
"That country must be recognised as soon as possible; if not, serious consequences may follow."
"That is what we in this House believe and that is what we should stick to."
"Mr Schulz mentioned a timeframe of one or two years; so it would be unacceptable even for the Socialists if Cyprus were not recognised in two years’ time, and that is something of which we have taken note."
"Secondly, clear language is also spoken with regard to the implementation of the Protocol."
"That should be set down right at the beginning of the negotiations in 2006; if not, this may have serious consequences."
"With this in mind, I would add that there is another side to this. Europe must take responsibility for encouraging the UN to reconcile the two parties in Cyprus."
"Last weekend, I spoke with the two leaders of both factions, but they had not seen each other in years."
"We should at the very least press the UN to send someone out there to talk to both parties."
"Anything else really would be an admission of weakness."
"Thirdly, as regards the legal position of the declaration, the Commissioner is right in saying that it has no legal meaning for us, but Mr Brok and Mr Poettering are also right to say that we have a problem if the Turkish Parliament uses it as part of the ratification."
"Mr Schulz argues that, if Turkey uses it for the ratification, we must cease negotiations forthwith."
"How can he claim such a thing if he wants the process with Turkey to go well?"
"I hope that the Commissioner will soon be able to confirm that Turkey is not making ratification dependent on it."
"Should Turkey do so anyway, it would be preferable for Parliament to keep in check, and suspend the whole process, so that we can exert maximum pressure to ensure that Turkey does not go down that undesirable route and avoids problems rather than, as Mr Schulz says, us maybe having to call the whole thing off in two months’ time."
"The resolution is also very clear about how we should deal with the negotiations in time."
"Whilst Turkey has, apparently, formally met the starting conditions, I would add that the new acts are problematic, because Articles 301 and 305 of the penal code ensure that Orhan Pamuk can be persecuted, a judge can call off an Armenian conference, and I am delighted that Prime Minister Erdogan has spoken out so clearly during the conference, also with regard to the Kurdish issue."
"That is courageous."
"In order to really solve problems, though, those laws need amending, including the law on religious minorities, which is not worthy of a country that wants to be part of Europe."
"It can never be right that priests cannot be trained there after years of promises, and that churches are still being taken from the people."
"That is why I welcome the use of the word ‘deadline’ in this resolution."
"If we take the priority as regards political criteria seriously, we must be so bold as to set clear deadlines and warn them that they have one or two years to put matters right; otherwise, we cannot move forward."
"Last, but not least, the resolution makes explicit reference to absorption capacity."
"Europe’s capacity to absorb a large country such as Turkey will need to go hand in hand with a constitution and financial arrangements, but above all, the man and woman in the street will need to be persuaded."
"That is for Turkey to do by means of good campaigns and real reforms, but there is also something for this House to do – not only speaking clear language in this resolution, but also by delivering on that language in the years to come."
"Mr President, listening to Mr Eurlings, we can in any case establish that we are agreed on many things in the resolution, but not, I think, everything."
"Where Turkey is concerned, there is a difference in attitude between some of the groups to the left, or to the left of centre, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats)."
"That is the first point I wanted to make. I am pleased, though, that we have a clear draft resolution and I hope that it will make it through the voting round unscathed."
"Needless to say, we mainly took this House’s position last year as our starting point for drafting the resolution."
"We have also deliberately repeated a number of points from it in order to explain the negotiation framework that this House would like to use in the coming years."
"We have asked for the first phase of the negotiations with Turkey to centre on the political criteria, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the position of minorities."
"In that way, the European Union will be able to bring pressure to bear on the Turkish Government not only to set down these rights and freedoms in law, but also to implement them effectively."
"We have insisted on this many times and will continue to do so; Turkey should therefore put this reform into practice and give it practical expression, so that we can evaluate progress in a good light."
"It is at least as important to confirm once again that the ultimate goal of the negotiations is full EU membership."
"At the same time – and that is also expressed in the resolution – the outcome will of course depend on the process itself."
"Success is our goal, but there are no guarantees."
"As the Commissioner said himself, the process is in itself very important and will also have enormous consequences for the future of Turkey itself."
"It has to be said, unfortunately, that the debate on the opening of the accession negotiations with Turkey and the text of the resolution are being overshadowed by two issues, firstly the recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, and, secondly, the extension and implementation of the customs protocol, also again in relation to Cyprus."
"These two problems, I am sad to say, have been brought on by Turkey itself."
"It is beyond us why a global decision such as opening ports or airports should be an immense problem of principle."
"We cannot understand why Turkey finds it so difficult to recognise all members of a club to which it would like to belong."
"That is why we insist on Turkey relinquishing its objections surrounding the extension of the customs agreement and on it implementing the Ankara Agreement in full and without discrimination."
"That is why we insist on Turkey formally recognising Cyprus as soon as possible after the negotiations have started."
"That is why we press home our position that signing an agreement with 25 countries also implies the recognition of 25 countries."
"We are afraid, and that is also reflected in the resolution, that these issues could lead to hitches in the negotiation process, or even to its suspension."
"That is not in our interest or in that of the Turkish Government or of the Turkish people."
"We would therefore expressly call on the Turkish Government to set down to work on this straight away so that these problems can be eliminated."
"Finally, although this is not a debate about Cyprus, or the Cyprus issue, this issue has been tabled and I would like to raise two questions in its connection."
"First of all, like Mr Eurlings, I would like to ask all parties to return to the negotiating table in order to break the surrounding the future of Northern Cyprus."
"Secondly, I would like to ask the same parties, as well as the Council and Commission, not to hesitate any longer and take the necessary steps in order to give the economy, and with it the people of Northern Cyprus, a chance."
"Mr President, I am sorry to see, judging from what previous speakers have said, that talks between the SPD and the CDU on forming the Grand Coalition are not progressing so smoothly."
"I find it extraordinary that those who have profited so much from European integration in terms of prosperity, security and liberal democracy should now refuse to extend those prizes towards Turkey."
"However, I agree with Mr Poettering that it is important for us to accentuate the Union's capacity to absorb that country."
"I wonder whether the President-in-Office could indicate whether he agrees with us that we need European settlement of the Constitution before Turkey and Croatia are able to accede."
"Would he also agree that the Cyprus problem will remain intractable and the Balkans fractious and unstable should the Union refuse membership to Turkey?"
"Would he say what steps the Presidency will take to promote efforts to open up financial and trade relations with Northern Cyprus once accession negotiations have been started successfully?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the run-up to important decisions in the European Union about Turkey, it is becoming increasingly evident that a battle – a tough one at that – is going on between reformers and conservatives about Turkey’s future, between a democratic Turkey anchored in Europe and an undemocratic Turkey in splendid isolation."
"Let me again make it abundantly clear that I would like the reformers to win."
"That means that the EU, in its relations with Turkey, must not mince its words, but must also be fair."
"Where Cyprus is concerned, the signing of the protocol by the Turkish Government means, to my mind, 100% implementation."
"Let there be no doubt about this."
"That also means, though, that the EU must deliver on its promise to bring the northern part of Cyprus out of its isolation, and that also means, while we are on the subject of Cyprus – and this I say for the benefit of the Socialist Members of this House – that things must be done in their proper order: we first need to ask Kofi Annan to examine whether a solution is possible, and then follow it up with recognition, because the other way round will not work."
"Being frank and fair also means that we need to praise Turkey for the new penal code, while pointing out to the reformers that this new penal code still contains far too many clauses and articles that can be misconstrued by the conservatives to frustrate the reformers, as we have seen in the case of the author Orhan Pamuk; that is why further changes are needed."
"As far as I am concerned, the negotiations can begin."
"I wish the Commission and Council much fairness and clarity and I wish the reformers in Turkey much strength and wisdom."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I had intended to start my brief, one and a half minute speech differently, but I must comment on the statement by my honourable friend Mrs Bonino, who spoke earlier and blamed the Greek Cypriots because they rejected the Annan plan."
"I think that it is accepted that decisions taken following referenda are respectable, as stated in the motion for a resolution, irrespective of whether she personally expresses her regret."
"However, I would expect Mrs Bonino to also explain the reasons why the Greek Cypriots rejected this plan and, also, to clarify that 35% of the Turkish Cypriots said 'no' and, also, that the settlers who are committing a war crime under international law also had the right to vote in the occupied territories in Cyprus."
"That by way of a brief comment."
"Turkey must honour its obligations under international law and the principles on which the European Union is based."
"Account must also be taken of the fact that the European Union consists of 25 Member States which include the Republic of Cyprus and that it would be a paradox if Turkey were to accede to the European Union and, at the same time, to have an occupying army on the territory of a Member State and to refuse to recognise it."
"Within this framework, Turkey has to apply fully and without discrimination the provisions of the protocol, including the chapter on transport."
"As such, it goes without saying that Turkey has to recognise the Republic of Cyprus."
"With a reunified Cyprus, Greece and Turkey as members of the European Union, peace and security in the area will, I believe, be strengthened."
"Mr President, sooner or later, ambiguous politics face punishment from the electorate, and the dubious course steered by the Council and the Commission in their dealings with Turkey is no exception."
"We have already had the first punishment: a Constitutional Treaty that has been torpedoed by two referendums."
"A second, late electoral punishment is in the offing in the form of new referendums if it turns out that the so-called ‘open-ended negotiations’ with Turkey are to culminate in membership."
"Why do the Member States not simply opt for a solid neighbourhood programme with Ankara?"
"In the final analysis, even a fully-fledged Customs Union between the EU of 25 and Turkey is already throwing up a nigh insurmountable political obstacle in the shape of the deep divisions about the divided Cyprus."
"Meanwhile, the prospect of negotiations with Turkey particularly saddens me on account of the position of the Christian church in that country, which is – and I emphasise this – without rights, and I am not even mentioning the serious cases of physical abuse of Turkish Protestants last month."
"I am looking forward to initiatives on the part of the Council and the Commission as regards compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria, and Commissioner Rehn might remember that I called him to account on the same subject one year ago."
"This morning, I heard a great deal about the so-called secular state in Turkey."
"Members who mention this issue do not know the facts, and it is with those that we should start."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in December we asked Turkey to give us a clear sign to show that it accepted the European Union’s rules on democracy by first of all recognising Cyprus."
"The Turkish Government’s refusal is, on the contrary, a sign of surprising intransigence."
"We are aware that it was a unilateral statement without legal effect, but for that very reason it was serious and unjustified."
"No less surprising is Europe’s attitude: with its eternal compromises it has once again shown its ambiguous role of putting off and exacerbating problems instead of solving them."
"We wish to emphasise that the outcome of Turkey’s accession procedure must not be a foregone conclusion."
"Turkey has to make tangible commitments, and we cannot make allowances on that account. I do not mean to say that there have been no improvements, but there is still too much to do on torture, respect for human and civil rights, and the protection of minorities."
"Above all, Turkey must not refuse to recognise an existing European Union Member State like Cyprus, let alone continue to occupy Cypriot soil with some 40 000 Turkish troops."
"What is needed is a serious, transparent accession procedure in line with the values of integration and mutual respect."
"We are also aware of the extent to which the Italian Government has committed itself to the success of the negotiations but, for the reasons that I have given, the delegation will mark its criticism by abstaining."
"That does not mean closing the door on Turkey; we just want the rules to be obeyed, because they must always be the same for everyone."
"Mr President, once negotiations with Turkey are opened, sooner or later they will regrettably result in accession, even if Turkey fails to meet the conditions set."
"After all, why should it strive to meet any conditions, when the fact that it is not doing so today is not deemed an impediment to opening negotiations?"
"Turkey will not respect our culture, and will try to impose its own on us."
"A country that was not previously Christian can never become European."
"All current and prospective Members of the Union became Christian over a thousand years ago, and no humanist philosophy can replace this common denominator binding all us together."
"Let us welcome Turkey as a partner but not as a Member."
"Two days ago President Borrell reminded the House, admittedly in a different context, that of the Constitution, that ‘Europe is for the Europeans’; otherwise, the Europeans will leave the Union."
"Mr President, I was one of those who, last December, did not oppose the opening of negotiations with Turkey, in the hope that it would promote the issues of democratisation and human rights in that country and foster peace between Turkey, Greece, Cyprus and Armenia in the region."
"Unfortunately, last year saw retrogression and no progress."
"One thing essential thing, apart from legislation on sex discrimination, was requested from Turkey."
"That was that it extend implementation of the Ankara Protocol to include Cyprus."
"However, only a week ago Foreign Minister Gül said that ports and airports have nothing to do with the Customs Union."
"The Council and the Commission want to brush this under the carpet, just as they have brushed under the carpet the treatment of religious minorities, Article 305 of the Penal Code, the question of the Armenian genocide, the repression of demonstrations by women and so many other issues, including that of Orhan Pamuk and freedom of expression within Turkey."
"Turkey's treatment as a candidate country has to be fair, but strict."
"Who among the previous ten candidate countries would have dared, when embarking on their negotiations, not to recognise a Member State?"
"And yet that is the case with Cyprus."
"We may lament the result of the referendum in Cyprus but must respect the outcome of that referendum, the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands."
"The complacency shown by the Council and the Commission weakens the message coming from those referenda."
"I am afraid that the problem here is not Turkey."
"It is the Council and the Commission."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdoğan, has done a great deal for his country, not least in changing it in ways that bring it closer to the European Union."
"He did it a disservice, though, in delivering this unacceptable unilateral declaration at the same time as he signed the Ankara Agreement."
"It goes without saying, though, that this agreement has legal consequences that Turkey must not merely accept but also put into effect."
"I do nevertheless believe that we, in the European Union, need to show Turkey what it means to think and act in a European way, and to go forward in confidence and with consistency."
"That is also why I believe that the European Union must open negotiations on 3 October."
"Why is this so?"
"Firstly, although the reform process that is going on in Turkey is facing obstacles and problems, to which Mr Kasoulides is right to draw attention, it would be irresponsible of us to curtail it, and it would be damaging to Europe."
"Rather than do that, we must help it along."
"Secondly, we must give all groups in Turkey, and such minority groups as the Kurds in particular, the chance and the opportunity to use this reform process as a means of finding new ways of expressing their culture and participating in political life."
"Thirdly, we have to ensure that Turkey, having been recognised as a candidate for accession to the European Union, should also, and in a similar way, improve its relations with all its neighbours, particularly, of course, with Armenia, and this will involve, among other things, acknowledging its own history and the atrocities to which that testifies."
"Fourthly, it is absolutely vital that we also give support to the Turkish-speaking population of Cyprus."
"We have a lot to say – and rightly too – about the island’s Greek-speaking majority, but let us not forget that it was the Turkish minority that said a resounding ‘yes’ to reunification and a resounding ‘yes’ to Europe."
"Let us not forget either that Europe has so far failed to discharge its obligation and responsibility to this minority in such matters as trade and financial support."
"For all these reasons, we should adopt a consistent attitude and say an unambiguous ‘yes’ to getting negotiations underway."
"It will be a difficult process, with many, many problems to resolve, but we must make sure that Turkey presses on with the reform process."
"If Turkey succeeds in doing that, then it can and should become a Member State of the European Union."
"It is only if it fails in this that we will need to seek out other forms of relationship with it."
"Let me say, for Mr Poettering’s information, for the sake of absolute clarity and the avoidance of doubt, that we, in this group, hope that 3 October will see the opening of negotiations not only with Turkey but also with Croatia."
"That would be a great signal to move forward."
"We have no desire to play Turkey and Croatia off against each other."
"Both countries are worthy of negotiations being opened with them."
"If we can start them now, the negotiations with Croatia will certainly be completed before those with Turkey, but let us go forward into the future of our continent with both these countries together."
"Mr President, with the date scheduled for the opening of the negotiations only a few days and hours away, Turkey has still not recognised the Republic of Cyprus, and the Turkish justice system has banned, once again, a conference from being held on the Armenian genocide, a genocide that Turkey has still not recognised."
"In spite of these serious violations of the duty to remember and of the principles of democracy, Europe’s institutions are acting as though there were nothing wrong and are confirming that the die is cast: on 3 October 2005, the European Union will begin accession negotiations with Ankara."
"I would like, in a word, to respond to all those who explain to us that starting these negotiations in no way makes their results a foregone conclusion."
"That is untrue, and for at least two reasons."
"The first is that these negotiations are opening explicitly with the subject of accession in mind, and not with a privileged partnership in mind."
"To say otherwise would be to lie."
"The second reason is that, obviously, the opening of the negotiations will lead to the subject of accession."
"Over several years, we will open, examine and then close again, one after another, the various chapters relating to accession."
"Yet we already know how the situation will end: no country, at the close of a long process, will take the responsibility solely upon itself of saying ‘no’."
"To say otherwise would again be to lie."
"Today, Europe is undergoing the most serious crisis in its history, and there is no project or prospect on the table, either from the Council or from the Commission, apart from the prospect, if the recent declarations are anything to go by, of turning our back on political Europe."
"The only item on the agenda is the enlargement to include Turkey, just as though, in this bewildered Europe, perpetual forging ahead were from now on taking the place of vision."
"In the future, Europe will require a real overhaul."
"We will support all those who wish radically to reform the European project in order finally to give substance to a political and democratic Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has already been said in this House about last weekend’s conference of historians in Istanbul, in which I was a participant."
"Contrary to what Mrs De Sarnez has just said, it did actually take place, and it did so because the Turkish prime minister and foreign minister stated plainly that it had to go ahead and expressed their solidarity with the academics and critical minds in Turkey."
"It would do credit to the European Parliament if all groups in it were to take this opportunity to thank the prime minister of Turkey for this demonstration of his courage in allowing this critical meeting to be held."
"That testified to his awareness of what it means to be European."
"I have returned, though, from Turkey, with a twofold mission."
"The first thing I have been asked to do is to thank all those in this House who, over a period of many years, have campaigned for human rights and democracy in Turkey, and that at a time when Turkey, like the rest of the world, was waging the Cold War, and when some of those talking about human rights today saw everything in Turkey except the problems with human rights."
"Secondly, I bring with me a plea for us to press on with the process of bringing the country closer to the European Union, for that is the only way in which democracy and reforms will be put on any kind of sustainable footing in Turkey."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the negotiations with Turkey start on 3 October, but Turkey must not be allowed to make a fool of the European Union: human rights must be at the heart of any talks."
"In contrast, constitutional reform has remained a mere aspiration and there is still the 10% barrier in electoral law that prevents the Kurds from having their own representatives in parliament."
"A new law restricts lawyers’ ability to carry out their professional duties; journalists can be arrested and their articles considered an attack on territorial integrity; teachers’ unions have been condemned for defending everybody’s right to speak their own language as well in school; and Mehmet Tarhan, a young Turkish gay, has been sentenced to several years in prison for claiming to be a conscientious objector."
"The situation is even worse in the Kurdistan region."
"Only a few weeks ago, Prime Minister Erdogan raised hopes that a peace process might begin, but nothing of the sort has happened."
"Although the Congra-Gel have declared the suspension of all military action, there are still reports of violent military action against the Kurdish population, together with torture and rape."
"The European Union must call on Turkey to politically acknowledge the existence of the Kurdish issue and to start public negotiations."
"The road to the European Union passes through Diyarbakir, the capital of Turkish Kurdistan."
"Human rights and respect for democratic rules are non-negotiable, yet the Turkish Government does not seem to have any intention of agreeing to the call from the European Court of Human Rights to grant Abdullah Ocalan a retrial."
"The European Union must not ignore that situation, unless it wants to undermine the credibility of that institution."
"The idea that Turkey can join the European Union without recognising Cyprus is utterly unacceptable: the ball is now in Turkey’s court."
"We can negotiate on economic and customs agreements for years, but never on human rights."
"– Mr President, we are talking about Turkey joining Europe."
"An example yesterday: it prevented the Pope from going to celebrate mass in Istanbul."
"Tell me, which other country in the world prohibits the Pontiff from visiting it?"
"Even communist Castro received the Pope with the honours befitting a head of state."
"Turkey bans him."
"That is racism."
"This ban is racism."
"It is not just against the Ecumenical Patriarch; it is not that they have converted the biggest church in Christendom, Saint Sophia, for oriental dances and swimsuit fashion shows."
"It is an insult."
"What is happening is an insult to Europe."
"It does not recognise Cyprus and some people are talking about the Annan plan."
"If the Annan plan was so attractive to Turkey, let it apply it to the 20 million Kurds."
"If the occupying army leaves, the 1960 constitution will be restored, with a Greek Cypriot President and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president and there is an end to it."
"Automatically, northern Cyprus will enjoy the benefits that southern Cyprus enjoys."
"It is a straightforward matter; it just needs logic, not the intervention of the Americans which, unfortunately, also directs the steps of Europe here in this Chamber."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have always looked with great interest on Turkey’s bold decision to align itself with the West, at least at the level of military and strategic choices."
"In particular, those like me who live on the most southerly patch of European soil, in the heart of the Euro-Afro-Asian basin, are aware more than anyone else of the need to establish borders and boundaries in a spirit of peaceful coexistence."
"The democratisation process that the Turkish Government has launched with a view to possibly joining the European Union still seems slow, uncertain and contradictory."
"Some obstacles have undoubtedly been overcome, but others have yet to be removed."
"It is not a case of the West subjecting Turkey to a long, never-ending examination, but it is essential to base enlargement on foundations of democracy and respect for civil and international rights."
"The European Union therefore has a duty to support Turkey on its westward journey of preparation, but it also has a duty to be inflexible and intransigent in this field."
"It would be totally unjustifiable to make any other decision for the sake of opportunism, so for now that justifies our considered abstention today."
"Mr President, those who are listening to this debate are already asking themselves how it is possible for people to act in such an irresponsible way."
"What was it, they ask themselves, that the decision-makers in the place promised over and over again?"
"No enlargement beyond the Ten without Nice and no further enlargement without a constitution for the EU, and what are we doing now?"
"We are making the way straight for Turkey!"
"If that is what actually happens, then I am convinced that history will bury the EU."
"We will have no chance to carry on with what was originally thought of as the European Union in any meaningful form."
"If we go on with this process, then that is something I regard as a great failure, and, indeed, particularly in view of its responsibility towards young people – as an act of betrayal by the political elite."
"So let us have some symbolism today as well, with another coffin in the plenary."
"You are ruining the European project!"
"I have time for a last appeal, made in my new capacity as a member of the delegation to the EU/Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee, and so I say: pull the ripcord and stop the negotiations!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the past weeks and months, I have lost count of the debates I have heard in Turkey on the need to keep to agreements – , but that seems to apply only to the European side, and, in this House, not even to all, but only to those who take a critical view of Turkey and its accession."
"The principle appears to apply only to us, with no demands being made of Turkey, which is evidently – to judge by the events of the past few months – not even prepared to abide by our rules. ; but not even the Council or the Commission put that into practice, for they constantly break the rules, and infringe the treaties that we have in common."
"They really ought to be taken to court for it."
"The Copenhagen political criteria are non-negotiable, and the other candidate countries had to fulfil them before negotiations could begin."
"Suddenly, none of that applies to Turkey any more, even though – despite all the reforms – everything there is wrong."
"What has happened?"
"Commissioner Rehn said earlier that the Commission finds Turkey’s misdemeanours regrettable, yet it is still arguing forcefully in favour of negotiations and full membership."
"The Commission tells us that Turkey now attaches great importance to economic and social development in its south-eastern regions; well, it does not."
"What is going on there at the moment is a great show staged by Mr Erdoğan."
"The truth is that the Kurds are shut out not only from the EU process, but also from their own national parliament."
"Let us not forget that it was a member of the Turkish Government who originally blocked the conference on the Armenians."
"Orhan Pamuk is being put on trial."
"The day before yesterday, Turkey’s gay and lesbian organisation was outlawed."
"Peaceful demonstrators were beaten to the ground and then hauled before the courts."
"Torture is still widely practised."
"The position of women is shameful; that alone is a reason to say no to negotiations being started, for there is no prospect of any change in that area."
"Freedom of religion does not exist in practice, but Turkey quotes it as justification for the country’s Islamicisation."
"By abandoning – whether out of naivety or in the service of massive national interests – any and every means of exerting pressure, the European Union is allowing all these things."
"In Turkey, though, things change only if ..."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has always supported opening negotiations with Turkey, with the clear prospect of its accession to the European Union."
"At this point, however, I should like to say to Mr Erdogan: frankly, you did not help us with your unilateral declarations when the Ankara protocol was signed."
"As you know, there are three groups in this Parliament, as has been seen clearly today."
"There are those who let it be clearly known that they do not want anything to do with Turkey and who have even been gleefully making funeral preparations."
"There is a second group: those who resign themselves to a marriage of convenience by telling themselves that, after all, Turkey is a great country, it is a crossroads for energy resources, it has water, it is a friend of the United States and it behaved correctly during the Iraq war by not interfering in events and that, when all is said and done, there still remain 71 opportunities for each country to use its veto during the negotiations."
"Finally, there is a third group, and this third group, to which I myself belong, believes in this project but believes in it as a real political project, opening the way to a tolerant, pluralist Europe that is accepting of diversity."
"This is not a funeral. Instead, this huge project, which is a tremendous gamble about which the voters will require some convincing, involves two aspects."
"The first is that we will not compromise, not on Cyprus, not on the Armenian issue, not on the rights of the Kurdish people and not on women’s rights."
"What we want is a proper marriage in which the parties concerned can speak their minds."
"We are adamant in wanting democracy of this kind."
"Yet, there is a second aspect, which is even more difficult to get right."
"Will we – by whom I mean Europe – be able to change without betraying our social model?"
"In welcoming Turkey, will we be able at the present time not only to enhance our institutions and to vote in favour of the Constitutional Treaty but also to show solidarity with this country which, large though it is, is nonetheless poor?"
"That is a question that remains open."
"However, if we open the negotiations, we must not forget that, in a marriage, there are two partners and that each of them bears a responsibility."
"Thank you, Mrs De Keyser, for that account of marriage."
"It was a fine way of presenting matters."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is in a crisis; we have no constitution, and how the EU is to fund itself in future is anyone’s guess."
"The institutions of the Community have too much to cope with even with 25 Member States, and the democratic deficit is becoming plain to see."
"If the EU itself were to seek accession to the European Union, its application would be rejected on the grounds that it was not a democracy."
"It is under these circumstances that negotiations with Turkey are now to be embarked upon, and, as there is no likelihood of the two sides achieving union in the foreseeable future, they must be judged by the same standards, as of course required by the Copenhagen criteria."
"The possibility of the negotiations being open-ended as regards outcome and duration must, in the interests of both sides, be guaranteed."
"Reform is needed on both sides, and the negotiations will present both Turkey and the European Union with a great opportunity to implement it."
"Thank you, and the Minister for Europe in particular, for your attention."
"Mr President, my country will always be grateful to Turkey for the solidarity it showed to Poland when the latter lost its independence in the 17th and 19th centuries and was partitioned between Austria, Prussia and Russia."
"On the basis of that same principle of solidarity, it is incumbent on us today to express strong opposition to Turkey’s entry into the European Union, because one of the Union’s Members, namely the Republic of Cyprus, is currently occupied by Turkey and its statehood is not recognised."
"Consent to this state of affairs would set a very dangerous precedent for all Member States of the Union."
"It would mean condoning a situation where the rights of smaller or weaker nations are sacrificed in the name of the political or economic interests of stronger ones."
"The history of Poland shows how dangerous this can be, and the recent agreement between Russia and Germany demonstrates that such a situation might recur."
"If we have Europe’s interests at heart, it would be irresponsible to discuss accession with Turkey at all until the latter recognises the Republic of Cyprus, which is a sovereign nation and a Member of the European Union."
"Mr President, the citizens of Europe do not welcome Turkey to the EU."
"If this Parliament votes for the opening of the negotiations, it will be acting against the wishes of the citizens who voted us into this House."
"The citizens of the EU do not want to see a non-European country and a non-European culture in the EU."
"Our citizens do not want the Koran to have any influence on European democracy."
"They do not want to pay for the development of Turkey."
"The politicians who would like Turkey to enter say that Turkey must take on all of our values."
"They do not know what they are asking for."
"You cannot take the culture out of a people."
"We believe our culture is unique."
"We are building the EU upon it."
"But the Turks think their culture is the best and they demand space for it in Europe."
"They tried that for a thousand years."
"We rejected it, but now some politicians will open the door that can destroy the EU."
"They underestimate Islam; they underestimate the demographic and economic effect of a country in which the religion is not only a religion, but also decides the politics."
"Mr President, 70% of Europeans and 80% of my fellow Austrians are opposed to Turkish accession, and that is quite understandable in view of the way things are going."
"If someone in this House – by which I mean Mr Cohn-Bendit – can get away with describing such people as racists, then I regard that as an unparalleled disgrace to a democratic political institution."
"Signing the protocol on customs union was meant to be a quasi-recognition of Cyprus, which would have enabled Ankara to save face while also meeting one of the essential conditions for the opening of negotiations."
"The disregard of every agreement by inserting the additional statement, whereby recognition is rigorously, but surreptitiously refused, and the toothless new compromise, amount, in many respects, to brinkmanship."
"Not only are we no nearer to resolving the issue of Turkey and Cyprus, but giving in would mean that Turkey would be dictating terms to us, which is absolutely unacceptable."
"Further evidence of this is provided by Turkey’s frequently arrogant attitude in demanding from the EU strict adherence to undertakings already given and backing these demands up with threats, while not regarding itself as bound by any treaties or agreements whatever."
"That is not the right way for Turkey to become a part of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the UK Presidency opened with a speech made by Mr Blair that was full of allure and ambition."
"From now on, we know that the only significant decision to be taken in this second – and yet altogether crucial – half-year of 2005 will be the opening of the negotiations with Turkey."
"Such a decision is the height of pretence and of diplomatic correctness, shows indifference to the opinion of our populations and is inconsistent with the European integration project."
"It is, above all, this project that we are talking about."
"The European Union that we desire is not the one that Turkey’s presence would force us to create."
"There is an incompatibility between our political Union and the destiny that this great Nation State, which we respect, wishes to pursue on a sovereign and nationalist basis."
"Since 15 December 2004, the situation has become even more perilous than what we have known in the past."
"We can clearly see that, when it comes to freedoms, rights, the non-recognition of the Armenian genocide, the situation in the region populated by the Kurds and, finally, the refusal to recognise Cyprus, the negotiations will be conducted under Turkey’s, rather than Europe’s, terms, which is a state of affairs that we have always criticised."
"How can it be said that, after the decision taken by the Council at the end of last year, we have now more adequately met the conditions for opening the negotiations?"
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative for this Parliament, which represents the people, to give a strong signal by postponing the decision on the Ankara protocol and by saying that the negotiations cannot be opened under the conditions that there is a desire to open them under today."
"Mr President, Commissioner, unlike the previous speaker, I, like many of us, remain convinced that Turkey’s accession to the Union is essential for guaranteeing reconciliation, peace and security in the entire region, for contributing to the effort to make it a democratic and developed country and above all, perhaps, for demonstrating to a Muslim country that, if it respects human rights, there is a place for it in a Union of democratic countries."
"The task, however, is a very difficult one, as this debate shows, since hostile forces exist that are gaining ground and striving to see this process end in failure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what we have here is a textbook case illustrating the political difficulty involved in taking decisions that are burdened with complications in the short term and whose positive results it will only be possible to appreciate in full 10 or 15 years later."
"That is why I urge you to grant a great deal of importance and to devote a lot of time to the task of explaining."
"You have to publicise the difficulties, of course, such as this unilateral Turkish declaration on Cyprus that has just been mentioned, as well as the recent cases of people being sentenced for their opinions."
"Yet, we must also emphasise the progress made and the reason for the delays."
"With this in mind, I cannot but believe that the declaration on Cyprus, which we regret, is a response from Turkey, long-awaited by its people, to the refusal of the UN draft by the Greek Cypriots."
"That does not excuse anything but does help us to gain a better insight into events and, above all, urgently to inform the UN of the need to step up its work and to resume its mediation."
"Furthermore, we must, above all, lay a great deal more stress than at present on the meaning of the academic conference held in Istanbul only recently on the Armenian issue."
"It is a taboo that has finally been broken, and it has taken a very firm commitment from the Prime Minister to make this happen."
"This does not mean that, from now on, Turkish public opinion is prepared to recognise what took place, but at least it is the start of a crucial stage towards such recognition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the process will fail if the negotiations that you are conducting and the progress that they give rise to are not mentioned."
"Give descriptions, explain yourselves – you need to fight on two fronts: that of your Turkish partners and that of European public opinion."
"Fight on both of them and never fail to do so!"
"Mr President, the fact that the EU begins accession negotiations with Turkey on 3 October 2005 shows that we in the EU keep our promises."
"Moreover, that is the way it should be in the EU, which is, and needs to be, a community founded on the rule of law."
"Turkey is developing rapidly, as I have seen with my own eyes."
"Turkey really is changing day by day."
"This process of transformation is something that we must support and encourage."
"Not everything is, however, as it should be in Turkey – far from it."
"The customs agreement between the EU and Turkey has been signed, but Turkey will still not allow Cypriot ships to call at Turkish ports."
"That is completely unacceptable."
"What I am demanding of Mr Erdogan is crystal clear."
"Turkey must treat the Cypriot ships as if they were Danish or French ships. They must have access now."
"The EU’s foreign ministers must make this indispensable demand of Turkey on Monday, 3 October 2005."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in relation to Turkey we have heard talk of human rights, religious freedom, the Kurds, Cyprus, the Pope’s masses, the Armenians and so forth. They may all be highly interesting and important, but in my view only one thing should guide us in our decisions: the will of the people."
"The citizens of Europe, the electors whom we represent, do not want Turkey in Europe."
"I therefore call on my fellow Members to respect the will of the people and not to consider ourselves superior to those who elected us, because if we are here it is because someone voted for us, and that someone does not want Turkey in Europe."
"Let us be consistent."
"Mr President, there are powerful arguments both for and against Turkey's proposed membership of the European Union."
"However, I do not have time to rehearse them now."
"For me the key argument is one of democratic accountability."
"The accession of a new Member State as large as Turkey would dilute the influence of all other Member States and would, therefore, further compromise the self-determination of the people I represent in the UK's East Midlands."
"For this key reason I oppose Turkish accession."
"I urge our Turkish friends to consider the proposal of Germany's Angela Merkel for a privileged partnership."
"This is not a second-best option; on the contrary, it would give Turkey most of the benefits of full membership with few of the costs."
"It is, therefore, a better deal than full membership."
"Indeed, privileged partnership is such an excellent deal that I wish it were available to my country, the United Kingdom."
"It would be a much better option than full membership on current terms."
"Mrs Merkel is not proposing that the United Kingdom should benefit from it."
"Mr President, last Christmas the Council voted for Turkey when it agreed that accession negotiations could begin on 3 October 2005, provided certain conditions were met."
"Those conditions have been met."
"The process of modernisation that has been taking place in Turkey over the past 70 years has been massively accelerated and additional attention is now being given to human rights issues and to overcoming historic grievances."
"Of course, there are still dissident elements within Turkey that pursue separatist ambitions or wish to reorient Turkey away from westernisation."
"Care must therefore be taken to ensure that any weakening of protective state structures does not become an opportunity for radical elements to change the nature of Turkey's unified and secular democracy."
"We have heard that the negotiations will be the most rigorous yet."
"Natural justice and fair play should demand that Turkey be treated in the same way as other candidate countries to the European Union."
"The Cyprus issue should be a matter quite separate from the candidacy of Turkey, but it has become inextricably linked."
"The history of that island has been distorted these past 30 or so years."
"There have been wrongs on both sides and no justice is served by the pretence that the Turks alone carry the blame."
"We should ask no more of Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots in relation to the Republic of Cyprus than we ask of Greece and the Greek Cypriots in relation to Northern Cyprus."
"It was the people of Northern Cyprus who voted in favour of the Annan Plan; it is the Government of Northern Cyprus that has expressed its readiness to reopen negotiations on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's plan."
"The rejectionists are in the south."
"Why should Turkey open its ports to ships flying the flag of the Republic of Cyprus when the ports of Northern Cyprus are closed to international trade and direct international flights cannot land at Ercan airport?"
"In May 2004 the EU Council promised to end the isolation of Northern Cyprus, but has done little about it."
"That is not justice."
"The Cyprus issue must be resolved."
"The unification that so many of us want to see must be brought about in a manner which meets the concerns and interests of both communities on the island, not just one."
"I welcome the opening of negotiations with Turkey."
"Those negotiations will last for many years."
"Commissioner Rehn has correctly observed that for Turkey the journey is as important as the destination."
"What is clear is that the prospect of Turkey's accession will have a catalytic effect on the nature of the European Union; the EU will have to drop its integrationist ambitions and become a looser community of sovereign nations."
"This will be of enormous benefit to us all."
"Mr President, in December last year, this House came to a decision, voting by 402 votes to 216, in favour of a start being made on accession talks with Turkey."
"I have to say that I fail to see either why it is that some apparently find that impossible to swallow, or why this whole scheme of things is again being called into question."
"If a decision we have taken is then openly questioned, what is left of this House’s credibility?"
"That is one issue, and Cyprus is another."
"I would be very glad if people were to devote some of the vehemence with which they campaign for Turkish recognition of Cyprus to the cause of the Turkish members of the Cypriot nation, with whom we should also concern ourselves, by urging us to exert pressure on the government of Cyprus to work for lasting reunification, as provided for in another plan."
"One-sided pressure I regard as unfair, for, at the end of the day, this is about a part of a nation – the Turkish Cypriots – who really have lost out, who have not managed to obtain what is rightfully theirs."
"This House must take account of these people’s rights too."
"As a republic, Cyprus consists not only of the Greek Cypriots; there are Turkish Cypriots there as well, and who, in this Parliament, is standing up for the rights of these people?"
"Mr President, there is no Turkish part of Cyprus, just as there is no Greek part of Cyprus."
"There is only one Cyprus: the Republic of Cyprus, which is internationally recognised."
"Some of us consider that starting accession negotiations with a country that does not recognise one of our Member States, continues to occupy part of EU territory and has an abysmal human rights record is totally nonsensical."
"Equally, the idea that Turkey must join the EU in order to be transformed is incomprehensible."
"By the same argument, we should get Iraq, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Nepal and many other not-so-democratic countries to join the EU."
"A woman does not get married to her rapist in order to reform him."
"She stays well away from him and hopes he is put in prison for a long time."
"Let us stop behaving like a subordinate of the United States."
"If Mr Bush, in his plentiful wisdom, thinks that Turkey is so great, let him have it join his own country!"
"Trying to get Turkey to become an EU Member is turning from a bad joke into a nightmare, and our citizens, who will pay dearly for our mistakes, realise this much better than we think they do."
"Let us stop insulting their intelligence."
"Turkey is an undemocratic, highly aggressive and super-problematic country and is light years away from European standards and values."
"Let us not turn 3 October into a black Monday for Europe, and let us vote against accession."
"Mr President, I call for the negotiations that are due to begin on 3 October purely and simply to be cancelled."
"I call on the French Government to brandish France’s veto on the morning of 3 October and to leave the negotiating table."
"If the negotiations begin on 3 October, the process will be difficult to reverse and Europe will be taking two risks: first, of disgracing itself by negotiating with a country that refuses to recognise one of the Member States of the European Union; second, that of disintegrating."
"The European Union is unable today, I am afraid, to resolve its problems, in particular those related to delocalisation and immigration."
"It would thus take on the burden of additional problems connected to delocalisation and immigration."
"That is why I invite everyone to adopt a clear position, and I address Mr Cohn-Bendit, who has questioned the sceptics over the issue of Turkey."
"I put to him the following question: Mr Cohn-Bendit, do you support the Turks who continue to deny the Armenian genocide?"
"Your questions will be passed on to, respectively, Mr Cohn-Bendit and the French Government."
"Mr President, we are now about to take a great historic step as far as the EU is concerned."
"For the first time, we are expanding beyond the borders of Europe."
"We are no longer talking of a European Union, but rather a superstate."
"There are nevertheless huge risks attached to opening negotiations with Turkey."
"Firstly, the interests of Cyprus must not be violated simply because of the presence of Turkey, a large country."
"The fact that Turkey does not recognise one of the Member States is an indication of her attitude as she enters the negotiation process."
"If the intention is now to commence talks without Turkey having recognised Cyprus, the whole process will be very humiliating for the entire European Union."
"Turkey will be dictating to us how to proceed, rather than the other way round."
"Earlier on, the leaders of a large number of countries emphatically demanded that Cyprus should be recognised."
"Hopefully they will not now be withdrawing their demands."
"I myself, as someone who represents a small country, am very worried that we will be allowing Turkey to walk over Cyprus."
"Evidently, nothing has been learnt from the French and Dutch referendums."
"I was especially worried by what Mr Schulz and Mr Cohn-Bendit said."
"They were so keen on the idea of an EU superpower that they paid no heed to the position of Cyprus, a small country."
"They did not talk about the status of the minorities in Turkey: the position of Christians, the Kurds, or even the status of women there."
"If they just want to make the EU into a superstate and do not at the same time strongly insist that Turkey should make headway in human rights matters, we can only ask: where does the racism really lie?"
"Mr President, last week, I was in Turkey for talks with NGOs and the government about my report on women’s rights in Turkey that this House adopted before the summer."
"The government is taking the report very seriously and has started to get new projects moving and to enact new legislation."
"In fact, the Minister told me that the number of relief centres has increased from 15 to 26."
"While I was in Turkey, many things have happened that have given people in both Turkey and the European Union much to think about."
"The problems concerned were a conference about the Armenian issue, the persecution of Orhan Pamuk, the recognition – or not, as the case may be – of Cyprus, and the closure of an organisation that stands up for the rights of homosexuals, Kaos-GL."
"I can tell you from first-hand experience that the conference on the Armenian issue, despite claims in various media to the contrary, did take place."
"In the end, the conference took place at the Bilgi University where I was, as it happens, giving a speech on women’s rights at the same time."
"I have also spoken, in Turkey, with Orhan Pamuk, the author, who is hopeful that the whole thing will fizzle out."
"He was also somewhat taken aback at the commotion in Europe."
"The Pamuk case indicates how important freedom of expression is."
"Whilst a government may not be able to interfere in the independent administration of justice, it can change laws that cause confusion in its interpretation."
"As far as Cyprus is concerned, I was given the assurance that the Turkish Government would certainly recognise Cyprus once a sustainable solution has been found for the whole of the island."
"The good news about the homosexual rights organisation Kaos-GL is that it is still active, but I would urge the Turkish Government to leave NGOs such as this one alone."
"They too must be able to take part in public debate openly."
"I would call on both Turkey and the EU to remind themselves of what is at stake when the membership negotiations open on 3 October."
"I wish Turkey and the EU much wisdom and patience on that day and in the days to come."
"Mr President, why is there such great indignation about the Turkish stance on Cyprus?"
"It is because we are diverting attention from ourselves; it is because the way the Turks are putting us on the spot hurts."
"The European Union was meant to take over peacekeeping operations on the island on 1 May 2004 – but we did not."
"We kept none of our promises."
"We have neither put an end to Northern Cyprus’ isolation, nor have we injected the EUR 259 million we promised for the reconstruction of the economy."
"It is not just the case that Turkey has to recognise the Republic of Cyprus; we must, once and for all, acknowledge that the Turkish Cypriots who live on the island are people with equal rights."
"Young North Cypriots are not even allowed to participate in international sporting events – still less are North Cypriots welcome as Members of the European Parliament, or as observers in it."
"When we say, in the Ankara Agreement, that we want to open up all the ports and airports, then the port at Famagusta and Ercan airport must be among them, in accordance with the principle of equal rights for all – unless, that is, Turks are second-class human beings."
"Mr President, it is unthinkable that one should wish to make Europe with and for the people of Europe and not listen to their opinion on Turkey’s application for membership."
"The people have requested some respite."
"Well, this unfathomable Europe, that of our Heads of State or Government, is demonstrating, once again, that it is not interested."
"This is a two-fingered gesture to democracy."
"Thus, nothing will be able to halt Turkey’s accession process, the accession of this country that lacks the courage to apologise for the Armenian genocide; of this country that does not recognise the existence of our friends from Cyprus."
"Well, the Council told us that such recognition was a fundamental factor."
"As far as I am concerned, it is an essential factor."
"Torture and discrimination against women still go on in this country, which does not respect minorities and the freedom of worship; it has no place in the European Union."
"Who are we trying to kid?"
"In order to reassure public opinion, the Council today maintains that Turkey will be very different as a result of its joining the European Union."
"Then, we are told that the negotiating conditions will be so difficult as to ruin these negotiations."
"What hypocrisy!"
"What do the people of Turkey think about this?"
"And Europe for that matter?"
"Europe is in crisis, and this crisis is serious."
"Its institutions are not allowing it to operate properly with 25 Member States."
"It still has no budget for the future."
"Thank you to the UK Presidency, whose only track record will be that of having bowed to US pressure calling for Turkey’s accession."
"This Europe refuses to come to a decision about its borders."
"What has become of our European integration project?"
"We are told that this accession is necessary for our economy and our security."
"Well, in that case, we should propose to Turkey a strategic partnership with a view to a strong cooperation project with that pinnacle of Europe comprising Russia, our new neighbours from the East, Turkey and the Maghreb."
"Turkey has no business in joining the European Union."
"Truth requires the courage and the determination to demand that the opening of the negotiations may result in this partnership."
"Unfortunately, Europe is continuing to forge ahead regardless, and with a cowardliness that our fellow citizens no longer accept."
"– Mr President, the PASOK delegation supports the joint motion for a resolution on Turkey, even if it is not perfect."
"It also supports, as it has from the beginning of this long procedure, the prospects of the real accession of Turkey, with real rights and real obligations."
"This means that the start of negotiations with Turkey does not imply that everything is negotiable."
"On the one hand, the honest will of the Union to see a European Turkey as an equal member one day is non-negotiable."
"On the other hand, Turkey's obligation to apply the protocol in full is non-negotiable and Turkey's obligation to recognise Cyprus is non-negotiable."
"If these obligations change into a simple wish list, it will be catastrophic."
"Consequently, clear objectives are needed, together with timetables, cut-off dates and sanctions if they are not achieved."
"We owe it to the people of Turkey, to its millions of citizens who honestly wish for a European, democratic, prosperous and peaceful country."
"We owe it equally to the European citizens, in order to combat easy and dangerous Turko-scepticism."
"We must give them the certainty that the accession of Turkey will come from honourable European negotiations and not from an eastern bazaar."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, having clarified that the New Democracy delegation supports both Turkey's European prospects and the start of accession negotiations, I wish to point out certain obligations which Turkey has, precisely because of its European prospects and the negotiations."
"Firstly, the immediate recognition of Republic of Cyprus which is, as you all know, a Member State of the European Union and on which the European Council recently took the right stand."
"Secondly, compliance without retractions with all the obligations which derive from the Ankara protocol, which Turkey has signed."
"Thirdly, respect for minority rights, especially of Greeks in Istanbul, Imvro and Tenedos."
"Fourthly, respect for religious rights, especially respect for the role of the Ecumenical Patriarch."
"Fifthly, I do not wish to start a legal discussion at the moment, but I do wish to draw the Commissioner's attention to the talks being held with the Turkish Government and to ask him to make sure that the Turkish Government does – I repeat – also send the unilateral declaration of the non-recognition of the Republic of Cyprus to the Turkish National Assembly."
"Finally, a candidate country must clearly improve its bilateral relations with all the Member States of the European Union as quickly as possible."
"– Mr President, all of us who consistently and decisively defend Turkey's path towards Europe welcome the positive fact of the start of accession negotiations, which may contribute towards the in-depth democratic transformation of Turkish society, to peace, to prosperity and to the development of the area as a whole."
"Only an honest strategy of clear objectives and clear messages on the part of the European Union can be effective towards Turkey."
"The consistent defence of Turkey's path towards Europe does not give it ."
"It must not see it as an opportunity to water down the preconditions and obligations which it has undertaken."
"Turkey has to respect the European legal order and European democratic principles on human rights, minority rights, the role of the Ecumenical Patriarch, the issues of the Greek minority, the Armenian issue, the diplomatic recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and the application of the Customs Union protocol within a clear timeframe."
"All these issues, Mr President, are issues relating to respect for the European legal order and the very credibility of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Turks are not making things easy for the Members of this House."
"We have to ask ourselves what is actually going on. Where Cyprus is concerned, what is the truth of the matter?"
"While the extension of the customs agreement amounts to its indirect recognition, a unilateral statement is made at the same time to the effect that it is not recognised at all."
"Never before, in the whole history of the opening of accession negotiations, has anything like this happened."
"The Turkish attitude may well be understandable, but we, in this House, must not stand for this sort of coercion."
"I would like to say, secondly, that nobody has so far been able to convince me that Turkey meets the political criteria; it may do so on paper, but it does not in reality."
"Authors who make explicit reference to the Kurdish and Armenian problems are hauled off and find themselves in front of a judge."
"Lawyers who seek to defend the Kurds’ human rights are obstructed when they try to represent their clients."
"I do not want to go into the issues surrounding women’s rights, but they fall a long way short of European standards."
"It was in the hope of progress in relation to human rights that the EU undertook to open negotiations with Turkey, but the crucial thing is that we are applying dual standards here."
"We are, for example, taking a far more tolerant line towards Turkey than towards Croatia, which has produced far more evidence of progress in this area and is meeting the targets of the Council Task Force’s Action Plan."
"The Eurlings report represents an attempt at squaring the circle."
"If it is not somehow laid down in black and white that these negotiations are open-ended, and if this House’s minimum requirements, as set out in these two additional amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are not complied with, then I am in favour of rejecting the whole report in order, before 3 October, to send a message, not least to the Council."
"In December last year I told this House that the European Union should honour its undertakings and acknowledge the progress that Turkey has made."
"Today I would like to repeat this appeal."
"As stated in the resolution we are about to vote on, Turkey has formally met all the conditions for accession talks to begin on 3 October."
"These accession talks will mark the beginning of a long and open-ended process."
"In the first instance it will be up to our Turkish friends to demonstrate that they are capable of meeting all the requirements and criteria that the countries that became members of the European Union last year also had to meet."
"These include political requirements, human and civil rights issues, economic preparations and many more conditions, but I believe and am of the view that the European Union should give our Turkish friends a chance, and try to overcome this obstacle, which many people regard as very serious."
"Mr President, all the problems can be found in the content."
"I would rather have anticipated difficulties relating perhaps to religion or ideology, and now it appears that Turkey is creating difficulties at political or diplomatic level."
"The fundamental question arises as to whether Turkey wishes to join Europe in a responsible manner, or whether Europe wishes to admit Turkey irresponsibly, at any price, in the spirit of international socialism or as a previous speaker put it in such fine romantic language, in the spirit of love."
"But fine is only what is true."
"Mr President, is this not a case of our being hoist by our own petard, or in other words of our being caught out by the rule sometimes known as too much invested to quit?"
"With all this in mind, is it not the case that Europe has moved too far in Turkey’s direction, despite the latter behaving like a spoilt child blackmailing its parents?"
"Is it not perhaps also the case that Europe cannot now afford to lose face by withdrawing, or does not know what other solutions it could conjure up to ensure coexistence and a common future?"
"It certainly appears as if institutional Europe as opposed to the citizens’ Europe has rather lost its way."
"I very much hope it will soon be back on track and time frames cannot be restrictive in this regard."
"Please note that I was brief, Mr President."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is a country on the move; it is no longer what it was yesterday."
"Its relationship with Europe has itself pushed the country towards major reforms."
"The Turkey of today certainly could not join the European Union, but we are not debating that, and the resolution that we are going to adopt includes a raft of conditions."
"We are debating the possibility of revitalising Europe as a leading figure that can promote a project of democracy and stability at a time when the world has seen a prevalence of insane political decisions based on hatred, fear and the presumption of exporting democracy with bombs."
"Such decisions have led to death, insecurity and greater instability."
"We have had enough of giving in to fear."
"We need a change, a sign, I would say a different policy, like the Zapatero-Erdogan proposal taken up by Kofi Annan regarding an alliance of civilisations."
"I am therefore in favour of opening negotiations for the sake of the security of Europe’s citizens; for the sake of peace; for the sake of the fight against terrorism, which, to be effective, must also include political decisions to isolate terrorists; and for the sake of the strength of Europe as a model of democracy that exports democratic values."
"Mr President, two principles appear to be clashing where Turkey is concerned."
"Which is more important: democracy and the Copenhagen criteria or Turkey's significance as a geo-strategic partner?"
"There is a serious danger that those who favour the geo-strategic argument are underestimating the gaps in Turkey's democratic attainments to date."
"Views are deeply divided as to whether matters are improving or deteriorating in terms of meeting Copenhagen criteria."
"The decision to press charges against Orhan Pamuk on grounds of having libelled the Turkish Republic because he had spoken critically of the Armenian genocide and the treatment of the Kurdish minority is deeply worrying."
"In a fully democratic state these cannot be grounds for criminal proceedings."
"There are those who would overlook these and many other shortcomings on Turkey's part, not least by saying that they are 'road accidents'."
"The trouble with that approach is that it gives too much leeway to those who are not really interested in the democratic transformation of Turkey."
"Equally, it disheartens the country's committed democrats."
"What is the point of being committed to democracy if others can get away with non-democratic behaviour?"
"All this raises a difficult question: does the Turkish Government have control over all the institutions of the Turkish state?"
"If it does not, then there is no way that Turkey can comply with Copenhagen criteria."
"That in turn raises the even more difficult problem of the Turkish armed forces, which still have the right to intervene in the political process as guardians of secularism and the country's territorial integrity."
"Is that compatible with Copenhagen criteria?"
". Mr President, I thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament in response to what has been both a timely and an emotive debate."
"I would like to shall begin, however, by echoing the earlier remarks made by Commissioner Rehn in welcoming to Parliament the Bulgarian and Romanian observers."
"I welcome also the timeliness of this debate and the genuine efforts of Mr Brok and other Members of this Parliament to ensure a broad base of support, so that the voice of the European Parliament is genuinely heard before 3 October."
"I should also like to thank Commissioner Rehn for his contribution to the earlier discussions."
"The terms and substance of his contributions evidence the extent to which a common approach is being taken by the Presidency and by the Commission on the important issues facing us."
"I pay tribute to Mr Brok and his predecessor as rapporteur, and indeed to the leaders of all the political groupings we have heard from today, in setting out their views so clearly."
"I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the work of other Members of the European Parliament, for example Mrs Pack's work in relation to women's rights in Turkey, which I think has been evidenced by both the experience and the expertise brought to our discussions and deliberations this morning."
"I ask Parliament's forgiveness for not seeking to respond to every specific point that has been raised during the course of what has been a long but nonetheless illuminating debate."
"Instead, let me try to address the main themes that were picked up on by a number of different speakers."
"I shall start with the general point alluded to by Mr Wurtz, which was that the Presidency is steering the Council to fulfil the mandate of the December European Council's conclusions, which were then indeed reaffirmed by the June Council."
"The decision essentially to open negotiations with Turkey on 3 October has therefore already been taken."
"Our job as the Presidency is to ensure that the conditions are met and that the framework for doing so is agreed."
"In this context let me touch on the issue of Croatia, which was alluded to by Mr Brok, Mr Poettering and indeed by Mr Schulz."
"Turkey and Croatia are of course separate issues."
"Conditions have been set out for both and the Council will make decisions independently on the basis of an assessment of those objective criteria."
"I am pleased, however, that in the case of both countries it is clear already that the anticipation of making further progress in relation to both countries' desire to be part of the European family has brought significant progress, as was recognised explicitly by Mr Duff in his contribution this morning."
"I shall also address some of the specific questions that were raised."
"Concerns were raised about Turkey's statement prior to 3 October."
"It is important to recognise specifically that concerns were raised in relation to the recognition of Cyprus and the implementation of the AAP."
"The Council's position on both of these matters is clear, and indeed was set out in the declaration which I quoted in my introductory remarks."
"I will let Commissioner Rehn reply to the specific points relating to your letter to him, but the Council's position on the need for full implementation, including the statement, has already been made clear."
"Indeed, the need for monitoring is also set out."
"Specifically in relation to the reforms that have already been undertaken, but also, more significantly, continue to need to be taken, I have noted very carefully the concerns expressed here this morning, whether in relation to the position of minorities, to the freedom of religion and expression or, indeed, more broadly on the issue of human rights."
"Commissioner Rehn has already commented on the specific issue of the case of Orhan Pamuk, the distinguished Turkish writer."
"I would, however, respectfully remind Parliament that the draft negotiating framework, and the overall reform process set out by the Commission, are designed to address exactly those concerns."
"Indeed, that is one of the reasons why both the Commission and the Council has been so keen to take forward the process of negotiation to ensure further progress in relation to the reforms."
"It is also worth reflecting at this point in our debate on the words of Mrs Bonino, who made clear that the European Union process has already achieved a huge amount within Turkey, notwithstanding the fact that there is much further progress to be made."
"One question left hanging in the air somewhat in some of the contributions has been to ask what the ultimate goal of the discussions and the process being taken forward is."
"Again, the starting point in responding to that question is to recall the conclusions of the December Council of 17 December 2004."
"Let me quote directly from the conclusions: 'the shared goal of the negotiations is accession'."
"However, the statement also went on to say that 'these negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand'."
"So let us be very clear that the shared goal of negotiations was full accession, but, equally, the conditionality inherent in that statement was very clear."
"I have also taken note today of the concerns that have been expressed over the absorption capacity of the Union."
"Indeed, this is reflected in the Commission's draft negotiating framework."
"Some speakers referred to the need for a settlement in Cyprus and this is, of course, an important and sensitive issue."
"However, I welcome the Parliament's recognition of the importance of widespread support being garnered for the UN process, and again that is reflected in the Council's earlier declaration."
"The final point I want to touch on is the issue of the Constitution."
"Many have talked about it in relation to Turkish accession."
"I would, however, respectfully remind Parliament that there will be further opportunities for discussion on the European draft Constitutional Treaty."
"Indeed, the June decision of the European Council was to have a further rendezvous and revisit this issue in spring 2006."
"That does not remove the obligation on the Council or the Commission to continue to make progress on a range of areas concerning Europe's future in the meantime."
"That is what we intend to do."
"I value the contributions made in relation to our thinking about Turkish accession and particularly value the opportunity to have heard the views of MEPs at this particular stage, given the imminence of the decision and the process now being taken forward."
". Mr President, I compliment Mr Alexander, especially as regards the questions about the legal nature of the declaration."
"Like him, I will skip the small talk and get straight down to business."
"Honourable Members have asked whether the Commissioner can provide a written statement from the Turkish Government concerning the ratification process and the nature of the declaration."
"I take this question very seriously and I am willing to ask for details of the ratification process from my counterparts in the Turkish Government."
"We need to take into account that Turkey has a parliamentary system – thank God, it is a parliamentary democracy."
"It is the Turkish Grand National Assembly that will have to ratify the Ankara Protocol, not the Government of Turkey."
"I am sure that as parliamentarians you well understand the order of business and will agree that it would be a very delicate matter and indeed questionable for a Commissioner to give guarantees on behalf of the European Parliament."
"The key point that needs to be underlined again is that the declaration made by the Turkish Government can in no way call into question Turkey's obligations."
"The protocol has to be fully and properly implemented and the declaration does not in any way reduce the legal relevance of the Turkish signature of the protocol."
"There is also a very strong revision clause in the EU declaration that the Member States adopted last week, which refers to 2006."
"Moreover, we have all the necessary means to make sure that full implementation takes place, for otherwise there will be direct consequences for the progress of negotiations."
"There is a very clear and strong conditionality – and please let us not underestimate the intelligence of Turks."
"They know that in order to make progress in the negotiations they must fully implement the protocol, as they have signed it and will soon ratify it."
"Concerning the prospect of new peace processes in Cyprus, which was referred to in many speeches, the European Union remains fully committed to our overall objective, which is the reunification of Cyprus."
"In that context, I would like to recall the declaration by the EU and Member States, which agreed last week, and I quote, 'on the importance of supporting the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to bring about a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem'."
"The Commission remains ready to assist the United Nations wherever possible, as proactively as we have done, and we will continue this work with determination in the future."
"However, let us be frank and open here: the keys to the solution are in the hands of the two communities and it is high time that both communities engaged in a serious dialogue with each other, so that Cyprus can become a Member State like all others, united and in peace."
"Both communities are keenly interested in a solution and they are best placed to address the critical issues."
"Certainly, we also expect Turkey to continue to work constructively towards a settlement and support the resumption of the UN efforts."
"Let us also recall what today's vote is all about."
"It is about concluding a procedure on the EU side, relating to a commitment that we have ourselves demanded, even insisted on, from Turkey."
"Now that we have achieved this, there are some on our side who say 'no thanks'."
"Seriously, I cannot help comparing this to a rather strange situation on a football field."
"Imagine that your team has worked very hard for 89 minutes to score a winning goal."
"Finally the striker is alone in the box, he passes the goalkeeper and he is just about to put the ball into the empty goal when suddenly the coach shouts 'stop, turn round and bring the ball back'!"
"Maybe this makes sense to some but certainly not to me."
"To my mind it is rather like an own goal."
"Moreover, it is difficult to understand why this House would want the Customs Union to apply only to Germany but not to Poland, to Greece but not to Cyprus."
"Again, this may make sense to some but not to me."
"By voting for assent now, you will help to extend the Customs Union to all new Member States of the European Union."
"Finally, and this is extremely important, I want cordially to ask honourable Members, for the sake of Europe, not to weaken our negotiating position by postponing assent to the protocol."
"Instead, by voting for assent now, we will be giving the European Union far greater credibility in its demand for rapid ratification by the Turkish Grand National Assembly."
"That should be our objective."
"Please let us keep this main target in mind and, for the sake of our credibility and for the sake of Europe, let us vote in favour of assent."
"Mr President, it was said earlier that personal statements must be made at the end of debates."
"We have now reached the end of one, and I would like to make a personal statement."
"If you wish to take the floor under Rule 145, you have a maximum of three minutes in which to speak."
"Mr President, Mr Cohn-Bendit accused those who are opposed to Turkey’s accession to the EU of riding a wave of racism and hostility to Islam."
"I would like to make it abundantly clear that I believe that the Bosnian Muslims are Europeans, that the Muslim Albanians are Europeans, and that our Muslim fellow-citizens of the EU are Europeans, but that, to take one example, the Christian Ethiopians are not."
"My misgivings are founded on the simple fact that Turkey is not a European state."
"To maintain that that statement is an indication of racism and of hostility to Islam is a distortion of the facts and a deliberate slander that I wish to repudiate."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit himself drew a subtle distinction between those who are self-evidently European and a shift towards Eurasia."
"That was actually a very astute line for him to take, although he then threw his chance away by starting to deliberately and slanderously accuse those who take a critical view of the situation as racists, and that is something I repudiate!"
"Mr Posselt, I am going to interrupt you."
"This is not a personal statement but a continuation of the debate, which we cannot resume."
"Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement."
"The Chairman of the Socialist Group in this House asserted during the debate that I had formerly advocated Turkey’s full membership of the European Union."
"I would like to make it clear that I do not do so and never have."
"I have obtained the minutes of the debate on 13 December 1995."
"It is quite clear that the only subject of this debate was whether to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to customs union."
"At that time, Mr Schulz and I were on opposing sides;"
"I was campaigning for a ‘yes’ to the customs union, while he was against it."
"What has been said today is a manifest distortion of the truth."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received six motions for resolutions(1) pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"We shall suspend the sitting until voting time."
"I fully support the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey this autumn."
"They will no doubt be long and difficult, but if agreement can be reached and if Turkey meets all the necessary conditions regarding the functioning of democracy and respect for human rights including the rights of minorities then there is no reason of principle why it should not be entitled to join the European Union."
"I reject the arguments of those who object to Turkey’s membership on the ground that Turkey is not ‘European’."
"That argument was settled years ago when we accepted Turkey’s membership of the Council of Europe."
"Opponents of Turkey’s membership try to equate ‘European’ with ‘Christian’."
"Yet Islam has played a part in Europe’s history and culture for centuries."
"In any case, the motto of the European Union is “unity with diversity”."
"We are not trying to harmonise cultures but to find ways of working together whilst keeping our various identities."
"By reaching out to Turkey we underline that the EU is not based on an exclusive European identity, but of an inclusive one."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen,"
"Parliament is preparing today to give its assent to extending the Ankara Agreement to the ten new Member States of the European Union."
"Members of the refuse to associate themselves with this."
"In actual fact, the Turkish Government was keen to emphasise that, in signing this protocol, it was under no circumstances recognising the Republic of Cyprus."
"In other words, the Turkish Government is denying any legal existence of a country that is a full member of this Europe in which Turkey wants to assert its presence."
"In view of Turkey’s exclusion of the Republic of Cyprus, the Council Declaration of 21 September is utterly scandalous."
"In actual fact, the Council is not drawing any conclusions from the position adopted by the Turkish Government."
"It is merely asking that, in 2006, Ankara respect these commitments towards all the countries of the European Union."
"In the meantime, however, the reservation clause desired by Turkey will take full effect."
"The only response possible would be not only to question the signing of the protocol, but also to abandon once and for all the opening of the accession negotiations with Turkey, which clearly are not the right path to take for ensuring calm and mutually beneficial relations."
"Either the Parliament continues to engage with such forces of progress as exist in Turkey, or we can throw away all leverage we have."
"It grieves me that the Parliament has today thrown a series of unnecessary inconsistencies into our Report."
"Turkish recognition of Cyprus, respect for human rights, better treatment of the Kurds, recognition of the Armenian genocide and many other issues must all be dealt with, as Turkey is currently far from any acceptable standards."
"The only way to raise such standards is to continue dialogue."
"Mr President, during the debate on our policy towards Turkey, I asked for permission to make a personal statement in response to a less than friendly comment directed at me by Mr Langen."
"During our time in this House, though, Mr Langen and I have had so many rows, after which we have always buried the hatchet, that I can dispense with the personal statement."
"I am delighted."
"Reconciliation is the very basis of the European project."
"Mr Brok, do you wish to reconcile yourself with anyone?"
"Mr President, there are many things we can achieve, but the greatest of them all is love."
"That is what I like to see; you coming to plenary with such a positive attitude."
"Before the vote, I would like, on my own behalf and on behalf of all of you, to welcome the members of the Delegation from the Mexican Congress to the official gallery."
"This delegation is taking part in the work of the first meeting of the European Union-Mexico Joint Parliamentary Committee, which is being held in Strasbourg."
"I would like to wish the best to the whole of the delegation and in particular its leader, Mr Fernando Margaín, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Mexican Senate."
"I am convinced that the work of the first meeting of this Joint Parliamentary Committee will represent a milestone in the strengthening of cooperation between the two parties, because we both advocate the same democratic values and the same commitment to the Rule of Law."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot offer you any declarations of love;"
"I think it is enough for us to be able to have mutual respect for each other."
"Pursuant to Rule 170(4) of the Rules of Procedure, I would like, on behalf of my group, to move that we defer our agreement to the additional protocol on customs union. The reasoning behind this motion is that the Turkish Government, although it has accepted the additional protocol, has, at the same time, whilst wishing to negotiate with the Republic of Cyprus, refused to recognise it, declaring furthermore that the ships and aircraft of a Member State of the European Union, that being Cyprus, are barred from using Turkish harbours and airspace."
"We take the view – logically enough – that this is inherently contradictory and politically utterly unacceptable."
"If we were now to give our approval to the additional protocol, then it would no longer be open to us – the statement by the chairman of the Socialist Group this morning notwithstanding – to exert influence on the Turkish Government."
"I therefore, and on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, move that the vote on the additional protocol be deferred."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I disagree with Mr Poettering."
"Contrary to what he says, the resolution, which we are tabling jointly, makes clear that we are demanding the full implementation of all the agreements entered into, and, as the Commissioner reiterated in his speech this morning, it also states that, if they are not, the negotiations will be suspended or even broken off."
"We should, I think, for our part, stand by the contractual agreements into which we have entered, for that will make it easier for us to retain a high degree of credibility if, in the event of the other side reneging on its undertaking, we have to declare that the negotiations are closed and are not being taken any further."
"We are therefore in favour of putting this to the vote today."
"– Mr President, I should like to request an addendum to Amendment 5, the correct amendment tabled by Mr Lambrinidis."
"As I have the English text in front of me, I shall read the addendum in English."
"At the end, after the phrase 'under the protocol', I should like the phrase 'and should not be sent to the Grand National Assembly for ratification' to be added."
"Mr President, I have a simple amendment to replace the words 'as soon as possible', in paragraph 6, with the words 'at an early stage in the negotiating process'."
"We shall continue with the votes, but first of all I must inform you that the Member of the Peruvian Congress, Mr Gustavo Pacheco, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee and of the European Union-Peru Friendship Group, is present in the official gallery."
"I would also like to point out that the last meeting of the European Union-Latin America-Caribbean Interparliamentary Conference, which was the seventeenth such meeting, took place in that country during June of this year."
"On behalf of all the Members of the European Parliament in the delegation, which was chaired by our fellow Member António dos Santos, I would like to express our thanks to the Peruvian Congress for its support for that conference."
"We shall continue with the votes."
". Mr President, this amendment has been agreed, not only with the other groups, but also with the Council and the Commission, as a compromise, and it recurs in Amendment 785."
"I shall read it out:"
"... 'without prejudice to the implementing measures already adopted, on expiry of a two-year period following the adoption of the directive and on 1 April 2008 at the latest, the application of its provisions requiring the adoption of technical rules, amendments and decisions in accordance with paragraph 2 shall be suspended."
"Acting on a proposal from the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council may renew the provisions concerned in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty and, to that end, they shall review them prior to the expiry of the period or date referred to above.'"
"Mr President, this too is a compromise between the various groups, the Council and the Commission, and it too will recur in Amendment 782."
"It begins like this:"
"... 'in the view of the European Parliament'; to which should be added the words: 'the European Parliament and the Council should have the opportunity to evaluate the conferral of implementing powers on the Commission within a determined...'."
"Mr President, this is the same amendment that we voted on before under Amendment 781, which I have already read out."
"The next one corresponds to Amendment 778, the second oral amendment."
". Mr President, today marks the beginning, in Milan, of the trial resulting from the Parmalat scandal."
"At the time the scandal broke, this House adopted a resolution requesting that accountancy rules within companies in Europe be made more rigorous, and I am, today, as rapporteur, able to present to you a package of measures that should tighten up the supervision of accountants generally, and, more specifically, of those working within companies."
"We managed to reach agreement on this with the Council and Commission in just one reading, an agreement that, moreover, involves a considerable restriction of the comitology."
"I would ask you to endorse this proposal and report in order that this House may send a clear message to the effect that we believe that accounting scandals within companies in Europe must stop."
"Mr President, there is a connection between the rapporteur’s Amendment 14 and my group’s Amendment 50. In Amendment 14, Category C has been deleted."
"In our Amendment 50, that is about three years’ national professional experience of locomotive drivers in cross-border traffic, we were working on the premise that this Category C was still in force. In agreement with the rapporteur, we will delete the reference to Category C, so that it can no longer give rise to anyone voting against Amendment 50."
"Mr President, although I would certainly like Amendments 32 and 138 both to be put to the vote, I would welcome it if the vote on Amendment 138 were to take precedence over that on Amendment 32, so that the amendment is amended to read as follows:"
"... 'they shall transport the bicycle of the passenger in all trains, including cross-border and high-speed trains, possibly on payment of a charge'."
"The proposal for a regulation has been rejected."
"The Commission has the floor."
". Mr President, the Commission takes note of the position taken by Parliament today on this issue."
"Having regard to its commitments vis-à-vis the European Parliament, the Commission will not hesitate to draw all the conclusions from a rejection by your Assembly, taking into account the Council's position as well."
"As my colleague Commissioner Barrot told you yesterday, the Commission will have to reflect on the best way to achieve the objective shared by all three institutions on improving international rail freight services."
"Mr President, we are about to vote on Amendment 5."
"I am an advocate of long-term thinking, but the Swedish version is surely wrong in referring to the ‘financial framework 2007–2123’."
"I suspect that it should be 2013."
"That concludes the vote."
".The Commission has not answered my question as to whether, at the end of the Helsinki Summit in 1999, Mr Verheugen and Mr Solana had to convince Prime Minister Ecevit to give his assent to naming Turkey as a candidate country."
"It is not clear whether the text submitted to the Turks at the time was the same as the one that had been accepted by the European Council in 1999."
"I should like to know the truth."
"I voted in favour of Turkey’s accession during the vote in December 2004, out of respect for those who campaign for human rights."
"Since that vote, there has been no end to the provocations on the part of the Turks."
"The brutal repression by the police during the demonstration of women on 8 March 2005, the denial of the Armenian genocide, the attitude towards the Kurdish people and the non-recognition of Cyprus lead me to vote against the start of the negotiations."
"I question whether Turkey’s membership will not be the outcome of US pressure and of the economic motives of certain European governments."
"We need to see acts on the part of the Turkish Government, proving its willingness to comply with the rules of the European Union."
".Only a few days away from the opening of the negotiations on Turkey’s accession to the European Union, MEPs from six political groups believe that it has fulfilled the final conditions enabling these negotiations to get under way."
"It is altogether alarming to witness these ‘European’ elected representatives compromise themselves by telling lies, acting disgracefully and giving in."
"Is it a matter of pleasing a certain internationalist pseudo-elite, of protecting a few obscure economic interests or, indeed, of giving in to the political will of the United States?"
"From a Machiavellian viewpoint, can this kind of attitude guarantee effectively that such and such an ‘enlightened conservative’ or such and such a ‘progressive’ will reap the lucrative benefits of re-election?"
"The reality stems more from the fact that these ‘representatives’ do not listen to their voters but scorn them instead."
"European public opinion clearly says ‘NO’ to Turkey’s membership."
"It would, in actual fact, be totally irresponsible for an Asian country which is, moreover, poor and with a Muslim culture, to join an unstable Union that has an uncertain institutional and economic future."
"It is not enough for Turkey to recognise Cyprus, an occupied European territory, in order to be able to join the Union."
"Turkey must not join the European Union quite simply because it is not a European country."
"The obligatory good neighbourliness does not involve us all living under one roof."
".Our Parliament is thus preparing to vote in favour of the legislative resolution relating to the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement."
"Although Turkey still refuses to acknowledge its responsibility in the Armenian genocide and still refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus through its continued occupation of the north of the island, the Heads of State or Government, the Commission and Parliament are preparing to bypass the opinion of the people in defiance of their sovereignty."
"The internationalist machine calmly pursues its course, concocting a policy that will prove to be disastrous for the economic and social balance, as well as for peace in Europe."
"In a period marked by Islamic terrorism, where fundamentalist networks are being broken up in certain suburbs, and at a time when our republican laws and our principle of secularism are coming into conflict with the development of a radical kind of Islam on our soil, how can Europe take the responsibility of forcing upon Europeans a country with an Islamic government?"
"In this matter, should we not, on the contrary, implement the precautionary principle by proposing another partnership?"
"This accession will do nothing other than reinforce a logic of promoting minorities in society, and one that paves the way for the fragmentation of Europe."
".By supporting the principle of Turkey’s entry into the European Union, the European Parliament remains deaf to the voice of the people, who are expressing growing reservations as regards this new enlargement."
"The time has come to set clear and coherent borders for the Union instead of endlessly forging ahead regardless."
"No serious political construction – apart from the creation of a single market – can dispense with defining the EU’s territorial outline."
"In fact, nothing has been undertaken to that end."
"I have been arguing for years for several circles in the integration of Europe to be created: the first would be a federal circle, which would be very integrated and in which there would be agreement as regards social and fiscal convergence; the second circle would integrate the countries of Eastern Europe and enable our policies to be strengthened at a more progressive rate; and, finally, there would be a circle of cooperation and of close and strengthened partnership in which Turkey would play a full part."
"Beyond that, I see no reason why we should not treat with the same consideration regions such as the Maghreb, to which a large number of the Member States are united by close links."
"What is being put to us has nothing to do with this project but confirms the fact that the European project is on its way to being diluted in a vast free trade area."
". I regret that shortsighted and narrow views won the day over the Turkish Protocol."
"The delay in voting on this is setback but should not fundamentally alter Turkey's progress towards membership of the European Union."
"The motion for resolution which was adopted shows acceptance that the question is not if Turkey will join but when and under what conditions."
"Mr President, since Turkey first applied to join the Union, our Group has supported this process."
"Our Group held a meeting in Istanbul where we endorsed this process directly."
"We think that Turkey has undergone a transformation in order to embrace modernity, democracy and the correct process for gaining accession to the European Union."
"Turkey has made efforts to adapt its legal system to comply with the Copenhagen criteria."
"It has also made advances towards democracy, human rights and the protection of minorities."
"I wonder why those who now claim to defend Kurdish rights have been silent for nearly a century and why they do not work for minority rights in other countries in the European Union."
"Turkey has a functioning market economy capable of being competitive within the Union."
"It also has an administrative and institutional capacity to implement EU rules and regulations."
"I think that we have to work so that Turkey recognises Cyprus and that we should consider what would happen if Turkey did not join the EU."
"There are difficulties at present, but I think we should facilitate changes in Turkey so that it can make progress towards joining the European Union."
"We decided to abstain, because the amendments adopted during the vote altered the meaning of the text in many cases."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I was leaving Genoa airport to come to Strasbourg, a Genoese pensioner, Giacomo Bertone, came up to me and asked, ‘But is Turkey geographically part of Europe?’"
"I answered, ‘A small part of Turkey is in Europe, and a large part of Turkey is in Asia.’"
"‘Then you must say no to Turkey joining the European Union,’ he remarked, and then continued, ‘but if Turkey does join the European Union, will it at last put an end to Islamic terrorism?’"
"‘No,’ I answered, ‘I really do not think so. Quite the opposite, Islamic terrorists will attack not just Europe but Turkey too.’"
"Then he added, ‘Mr Fatuzzo, as the representative of the Pensioners’ Party you must vote against Turkey joining the European Union for those reasons, while remaining a good friend to the people of Turkey.’"
"That is what I have done, Mr President."
"Mr President, Turkey is an extremely important country from a European perspective, too."
"Nevertheless, we should be aware that even countries as large as Turkey, which on top of this is a candidate country, must comply with certain criteria."
"We should be aware that the fundamental values of the Union are at stake here."
"I believe that last week’s judgment by the Supreme Court, which ruled against the conference in Istanbul on the reappraisal of the past relating to the genocide of Armenians, gives ample food for thought and shows us that fundamental rights are probably not being respected in Turkey."
"For this reason, I rejected this resolution, and I believe that we would all be well advised to insist on respect for the fundamental values of the Union and to apply the same conditions to Turkey."
"– Mr President, today’s vote was a colossal shot across the bows of the Council on the issue of Turkey."
"Opening negotiations with Turkey but not Croatia next Monday would give the EU public the impression that all 25 Members of the Council had collectively taken leave of their senses."
"This not being a desirable scenario, there are certain things I would urge tomorrow’s meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives to do."
"Firstly, to give the green light to Croatia, a European country that meets all the conditions."
"Secondly, if you negotiate with Turkey, to do so only if the negotiating framework makes clear that the objective is a privileged partnership."
"If this proves unattainable, I must appeal to the Member States to make use of unanimity and postpone negotiations with Turkey, as was done – unjustly – in the case of Croatia on 16 March – one day before negotiations were due to begin."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we voted ‘no’ to the resolution on Turkey because we believe that Turkey will be Islam’s Trojan horse in Europe."
"We voted ‘no’ and we hope that at least one of the Member States will oppose the 3 October decision, because it would be an ill omen for the future of Europe."
"I personally hope and wish that it will be my government that does so, the Government of Italy, a country that has historical roots that go all the way back to that great tradition of European and Christian opposition and resistance to the Islamic invasion, which is summed up in a single word: Lepanto."
"Those who must decide on 3 October should remember Lepanto: no Islam in Europe; no Islam in Europe ever!"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Turkey is not Europe."
"Its sensibilities, uses, customs and dominant religions are too different; its forms of interpersonal and gender relations are too different; its geopolitical interests conflict, as they are too closely linked to those of the United States, which – I must point out – conflict with ours."
"Cyprus, first of all: we should be ashamed even to begin such talks when a Member State and an old ally is still not recognised and is partly under military occupation by Turkey."
"Then there is the Armenian genocide, the Kurdish issue, civil liberties, social tensions – I could go on with a long list of undeniable contrasts that count against Turkey joining the European Union."
"The system by which political weight in the European Parliament and the Commission is proportional to population will give Turkey a dominant role in European Union decision-making."
"We resisted Turkey’s annexation of Europe – for that is what we are dealing with – at Lepanto and then at Vienna."
"The vast majority of Europeans do not want Turkey in Europe: that is the people’s mandate, and we have a duty to respect it by voting ‘no’."
"Mr President, a few days ago, the Flemish newspaper wrote that Turkey’s future EU Member State status was decided on a long time ago and that an anonymous EU top official had told the paper that the so-called open-ended nature of the negotiations was no more than window dressing and that, I quote, ‘the phrase “open-ended” is included only in order to fool critics into thinking that no definite decisions have been taken’."
"That says it all, really."
"I think that the Turkey issue is becoming the most striking and most politically frightening illustration of the way in which the European Union is suspending the normal democratic decision-making processes and is ramming decisions down the public’s throat, if need be with all the dirty tricks of the trade, and, in the case of Turkey, with lies and deceit."
"You need have no illusions about that, though, as the last word has not yet been spoken, and our opposition to the accession of Islamic Turkey to the European Union will only become stronger and more determined, and the European public will back us even more than they do already."
"Mr President, I voted against the motion for a resolution on the opening of negotiations with Turkey, because I consider it irresponsible to start negotiations on its accession."
"Turkey in no way meets the preconditions for the opening of accession negotiations."
"It is rumoured that torture is still practised there, violations of human rights persist and Christians continue to be substantially hindered in the practice of their religion, to name but a few reasons."
"It is incomprehensible how the Commission is going against its better judgment on this."
"The Commissioner responsible for enlargement, Mr Rehn, should step down before he does any more damage."
"He is offending against the concept of European integration on a massive scale."
"We should not be surprised when increasing numbers of citizens lose confidence in European institutions such as Parliament, the Commission and the Council and the majority therefore votes against the Constitution, as it did in the referenda in France and the Netherlands."
"In rejecting the resolution on Turkey, I, like my friend Mr Posselt, have most certainly acted in the interests of the great majority of the Bavarian electorate, which wants a privileged partnership with Turkey, not full membership."
"Incidentally, many of my Turkish friends share this opinion."
". As an opponent of non-European Turkey joining the EU, I have today voted against the resolution endorsing the opening of negotiations with this Asian state."
"I believe it is a shameless agenda of expansionism which drives the EU in wanting to encompass Turkey."
"Moreover, Turkey's duplicity over Cyprus makes it unworthy of membership."
"On one hand it disingenuously accepts a Protocol apparently accepting Cyprus, but at the same time issues a declaration disavowing any such recognition."
"When added to its cruel history and continuing persecution of Christians, it is clear that Turkey is one country and culture that we can well do without."
".I am convinced that joining the EU is synonymous with subscribing to certain values, in particular in the area of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"That is why Turkey must become a full-scale democratic country."
"The prospect of its joining the EU can bring about positive developments leading to a real, and not only virtual, kind of democracy, which recognises and respects its minorities, in particular the Kurdish population, and to greater respect for human rights, by putting an end to the violations of the freedom of expression such as the recent conviction of the author, Orhan Pamuk, as well as to a fresh perspective on the dark pages of its past, through recognition of the Armenian genocide."
"Nevertheless, on the eve of the 3 October deadline – the date on which the Council must reach a decision about the opening of the accession negotiations – we are far short of the target."
"On the contrary, Turkey is digging in its heels and even becoming more radical as regards at least two points: the recognition of Cyprus, which can under no circumstances form the subject of negotiations, and the stubborn refusal to tackle the issue of the Armenian genocide, a willingness to tackle which I consider to be a preliminary condition for membership."
"That is why I, together with others, tabled two amendments to supplement a resolution that is particularly reticent on the subject of the Armenian genocide."
"It is the responsibility of the European Parliament to point out to a modern Turkish State that professes to be on the road to democracy that it has a duty to remember."
".By formally opening accession negotiations with Turkey, the European Heads of State or Government will be taking a decision for which they will have to be answerable to the people and to history."
"The authorities of my country are, however, in possession of a clear mandate from the people they are supposed to represent: on 29 May 2005, the people of France rejected the European Constitution and the project of enlargement to include Turkey."
"Today, the representatives of the UMP party in this Parliament are worried about the dangers of an ‘autistic’ Europe and of the danger of a divorce between the people and the European project."
"What a revelation!"
"Do they recall that they regularly voted in favour of the pre-accession credits for Turkey?"
"Do they recall that, within the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, they sit alongside the AKP, the Islamic party led by Mr Erdogan?"
"Are they only aware that the person who holds the key to this affair is the most senior among them, Mr Chirac?"
"This collective lie, which says that Turkey must enter the Union, is disgraceful, since each of them, in silence, is hoping that the other one will say ‘no’ and take responsibility for the breakdown."
"That is why, on behalf of the people of France, we solemnly address the President of the Republic and call on him to veto the opening of these negotiations."
". Although the Commission and the Council consider that Turkey has formally met the final conditions for accession talks to open on 3 October 2005, the truth is that there are key questions that were not taken into account, as Parliament’s resolution mentions."
"One of the most important issues centres on the protocol extending the Ankara agreement to the ten new Member States. Turkey signed the protocol but at the same time issued a statement saying that the signature, ratification and implementation of the protocol does not represent recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, referred to in the protocol, in any way, shape or form."
"We object to this unacceptable position."
"We also object to Turkey’s continued ban on vessels flying the Cypriot flag and vessels from ports in the Republic of Cyprus from entering Turkish ports, and to the ban on Cypriot aircraft from flying over Turkish airspace and landing in Turkish airports."
"We abstained from the vote on the resolution, due to our objections to some of the points therein."
"For example, it advocates constitutional reform as a condition for the accession of other new Member States; we believe that this is not an obstacle to enlargement."
"If a country in the immediate vicinity of Europe complies with the EU’s political and economic requirements, there should in principle be no obstacles to membership."
"The EU is not a cultural or religious block, but a form of cooperation in which the Member States have to guarantee democracy, human rights and a functioning market economy."
"Turkish membership cannot therefore be dismissed on religious or geographical grounds."
"The June List therefore believes that Turkey should in the long run be able to become a member of the EU."
"However, the EU has not been reformed sufficiently to enable it to receive Turkey as a member."
"That especially applies in the cases of agricultural policy and the Structural Funds."
"Nor has Turkey done enough to comply with the EU’s political requirements."
"Quite a few requirements concerning respect for human rights have not been implemented."
"The Armenian genocide of 1915 has not been recognised, and nor has Cyprus’s sovereignty."
"Moreover, the financial consequences for the EU of Turkish accession are still uncertain."
"Finally, the draft Constitutional Treaty has now been rejected, so no one knows how the EU is to be governed in the future."
"That is another important reason for delaying membership negotiations."
"In view of these factors, we believe that membership negotiations should not be embarked on as matters stand."
"We are therefore voting against the resolution as a whole."
". Many now see the Cyprus issue as the most controversial."
"Indeed, by signing the protocol on customs union on 29 July 2005, Turkey has needlessly put everyone on edge."
"This was, to some degree, to be expected."
"That its signing would be tantamount to the recognition of Cyprus is mainly, and only, based on declarations made by European Heads of Government and has never been corroborated by Turkey."
"What is more, on returning to Ankara – following the negotiations in December 2004 under the Dutch Presidency – Mr Erdogan made it known at once that the signing would certainly not amount to recognition of Cyprus, whether explicit or implicit."
"With regard to the Cyprus issue, I take the view that the Council should make every effort to bring about the unification of Cyprus."
"For this, we need to take the Turkish Cypriot community out of its economic isolation as soon as possible."
"As expressed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution, Turkey must, of course, embark on full implementation of the customs union without delay, thereby, among other things, opening up its ports to Cypriot ships."
"Parallel to this, though (and hence with the same timescale), the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community must end, and so paragraph 7, appealing though it is, is too non-committal."
".On many occasions, we have stressed the fact that Turkey is not a European country, whether by virtue of its geography, its history, its culture, its language or its religion."
"Faced with such evidence that is borne out by the Treaties, one cannot but conclude that the leaders of Europe are blind."
"Only the people of Europe, instilled with the common sense absent in their leaders, have understood for a long time that Turkey’s joining Europe would mean an end to the European adventure and, above all, would entail the rapid spread of Islam in European society."
"The Turkish people, who are themselves being provocative, refuse to recognise the Republic of Cyprus on the grounds that they occupy part of it. They do so in defiance of international law."
"This is without mentioning the Armenian genocide of 1915."
"The duty to remember, which our great Western consciences hold so dear, has not reached as far as them."
"In their new penal code, making reference to this very Armenian genocide or to the occupation of the northern part of Cyprus is punishable by imprisonment."
"In these conditions, and without even mentioning the tragic fate of the Christian minorities, it is obscene to open accession negotiations on 3 October with a large country in Asia Minor."
".On Wednesday 28 September, in the debate on Turkey, the speeches and the clapometer were unequivocal."
"It was a ‘no’ from all sides."
"The speakers spoke of ‘Armenia’, ‘the violation of human rights’, ‘the light years separating two civilisations’, ‘the occupation in Cyprus of part of European territory by a foreign army …’ Even Mr Toubon, the French MEP and great devotee of President Chirac, had his say in opposing matters."
"We heard a British MEP propose to the people of Turkey that they accept the status of a privileged partner, which is such an attractive prospect that he is demanding it for the United Kingdom."
"However much Mr Cohn-Bendit shouted ‘racism’, Mr Rocard pleaded for Turkey’s accession amid disapproving silence."
"In this House, the representatives of the people of Europe’s nations are repeating the ‘no’ uttered by Cervantes at Lepanto, by Lord Byron at Missolonghi, by the Greek children of the Catacombs who used to practice their religion in fear, by the paintings and poems of, respectively, Delacroix and Victor Hugo on the empire of massacres and kidnappings, and by the martyrs of ‘Midnight Express’."
". A week before the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey on EU membership, there is little cause for optimism."
"Its development towards being a normal country in which all ethnic groups, all political opinions and all religious faiths are considered equal is stagnating."
"Last week, a court banned a conference on the mass murder of the Armenian people in 1915, which had been denied for many years."
"The large Kurdish community in the South-East still has no prospects of education, administration and media in their own language, of normal representation in the national parliament or of regional self-government."
"Prominent forces in Turkey reject further concessions to European wishes and even hold out the threat of Turkey’s membership application being withdrawn."
"Over the last few weeks, interest in the situation in Turkey seems to have shifted to the country’s relationship with Cyprus."
"It is unacceptable that ships from southern Cyprus should still be barred from Turkish ports, while Turkey claims that it has observed all agreements since as long ago as 2004."
"This does not augur well for other areas of discussion."
"As an EU Member State, Cyprus has the right to veto negotiations and membership."
"The disadvantaged groups within Turkey do not have such influence."
"That is why this House should especially take their problems and interests to heart."
". – Τhe joint motion for a resolution on the start of negotiations with Turkey demonstrates that this procedure relates to the more general interests of and in-fighting and competition between the imperialist powers in the area."
"From this point of view, the pressures and coercion on the peoples in the area will intensify for them to accept solutions which are at their own expense."
"This motion for a resolution comes within the more general philosophy of the European Council's so-called counter-declaration."
"Despite the fact that it contains some positive points, it does not clearly state the obvious, by which I mean a clear declaration that, unless there is immediate recognition of the Republic of Cyprus, negotiations for Turkey's accession to the EU will not start."
"The Communist Party of Greece is against the accession for the same reasons as it was against the accession of Greece."
"We consider that the very policy and the character of the EU do not offer any guarantee, however many resolutions are passed on a fair solution to the Cyprus question."
"This is also being proven now."
"The supposed principles of the EU and the famous are being used in keeping with the interests of the imperialist countries."
". This compromise resolution deals with the Turkey–Cyprus issue satisfactorily and reasonably clearly."
"I should have liked to see clearer statements regarding democracy und human rights in Turkey."
"According to Amnesty International, torture in Turkey continues to assume proportions similarly serious to before; it just takes a different form."
"The case of Mehmet Tarhan was a recent example of how conscientious objectors are punished with years of imprisonment."
"There are renewed conflicts in the Kurdish regions, police and military forces are omnipresent, and state and non-state actors commit human-rights violations."
"Freedom of the press is continually violated: for example, anyone publishing material that takes a critical line on the genocide of Armenians or the continuing Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus still faces imprisonment."
"As far as the EU Heads of State or Government are concerned, a key motivation for this accession is geopolitics."
"A Commission working document drawn up to render Turkey’s accession to the EU plausible states: ‘Turkey is a strategically important country (...)"
"Turkey’s accession would help to secure better energy supply routes for the EU.’"
"It continues: ‘With its large military expenditure and manpower, Turkey has the capacity to contribute significantly to EU security and defence’."
"I, too, wish to see Turkey’s accession to the EU; just not like this."
"The EU Heads of State or Government and the European Commission evidently care little about the real-life situation of the people."
". The key precondition for giving my consent to the joint draft resolution of the European Parliament on the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey, drawn up further to the resolution of 15 December 2004 and the conclusions of the European Council of 17 December 2004, would be approval of the motions in favour of amending and supplementing, Nos 2 and 3."
"Should these amendment motions not be approved, I will vote against the resolution."
"I have the following reasons for this decision."
"I believe that Turkey has failed to meet the Copenhagen criteria for opening accession negotiations with the EU in view of its persistent problems with human rights, its failure to tackle the problems of the Kurdish minority and, most importantly, its refusal to grant legal and political recognition to an EU Member State – Cyprus."
"Without the unanimous consent of all Member States, it is not possible to grant the mandate for launching accession negotiations with Turkey."
". The negotiating process towards Turkey’s accession to the EU should proceed in the usual way and should observe clear and objective rules."
"To my mind, there is no possible justification for treating this application for membership any differently."
"On that basis, I had no option but to vote against the joint motion for a resolution before us, on account of two points that I believe are of crucial importance."
"Firstly, by rejecting the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats clearly stating that ‘…most importantly…, from the outset, the negotiations must be conducted with an open mind, and ways forward other than full accession should be considered’, Parliament clearly refuses to incorporate a Plan B into its resolution, which I feel is essential if we are to avoid the possibility, at some point in the future, of the opening of the negotiation process being taken as full commitment to accession."
"It is, moreover, abundantly clear that the Cyprus issue has not been properly resolved."
"Turkey is seeking to join the EU but does not accept the Union in its current form."
"Let us face facts: you cannot join an organisation that you do not recognise, just as you cannot negotiate with a party that does not recognise your organisation."
"These negotiations are starting off on the wrong foot and consequently do not have my backing."
". On 23 September 2005, the Turkish Court of Justice banned a conference on the Armenian genocide from being held."
"This ban unfortunately makes it clear that the Turkish Government authorities continue to keep this debate shrouded in complete obscurity and entirely outside the law."
"The power of the present and, more specifically, that of the past thus force us to reaffirm the fact that the people of Europe will not overlook this issue."
"Therefore, I must, I am afraid, reiterate the speech I made on 6 October 1999, since there has been no change whatsoever in the situation."
"The resolution of the European Parliament of 18 June 1987 emphasised four points comprising major obstacles to the accession negotiations with Turkey."
"They related to:"
"1/ the refusal of the Turkish Government to recognise the Armenian genocide"
"2/ its reluctance to comply with international law in its differences of opinion with Greece"
"3/ the ongoing presence of Turkish occupying troops in Cyprus"
"4/ the denial of the Kurdish issue."
"The Armenian issue cannot be sunk into oblivion as these negotiations become part of history."
"I stand firm in refusing to accept that."
"The European Union is strong enough to impose upon Turkey a significant change of attitude, if the latter wants to join our Union and respect our rules and values."
". Even as we speak, a battle is being fought out in Turkey between reformists and traditionalists."
"The current Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister belong to the former group and deserve all our support."
"The debate about the opening of the negotiations has recently been fed by political opportunism, many, as my group chairman, Mr Cohn-Bendit, has said, riding on a wave of latent racism."
"It would be unfair to be stricter at present than the Heads of Government had agreed in December and it would also send the Turkish people the discouraging message that Europe does not actually want Turkey. Those who make negotiations conditional upon the recognition of Cyprus overlook the fact that a swift recognition of Cyprus by Turkey would spell the end of Kofi Annan’s attempts to set up a fresh round of negotiations about the island’s division."
"The EU must support the reformers, demand the correct implementation of the customs union and insist on the penal code being honed down further."
"The opening of the negotiations will send Turkey further into the direction of a secular state where people, along with international law, are respected in full and in practice."
"Religious minorities, Kurds and Alavites will be better off in a Turkey that forms part of the EU than in a Turkey that turns its back on our continent."
". The motion on the opening of negotiations with Turkey is to be welcomed."
"However, I hope that in these negotiations religious freedom will be highlighted."
"The right for someone to freely express their religious belief is essential in any democratic society."
"The First Step Forum, an NGO committed to religious freedom, will be visiting Turkey in the next few weeks."
"I hope that the Commission will listen to the outcomes of the delegation's visit."
".On the subject of the assessment made of Turkey’s transition to a democratic country, the country still has some way to go, in spite of the efforts made."
"The Turkish Government’s recognition of Cyprus and the Armenian genocide remain preliminary conditions for the negotiations to continue after 3 October."
"The EU will also have to remain particularly vigilant as regards the human rights situation."
"The condition of women in the country remains of concern, and the Turkish Government must make a greater commitment to reducing the inequalities between men and women."
"Freedom of expression has still not been acquired."
"The EU must endeavour to put pressure on Ankara so as to ensure that the conditions are met for a viable public and democratic debate."
"Since this is an open process, whose results cannot be guaranteed in advance, and given that each and every one of the 25 Member States will benefit from the right of veto at any time during the negotiations, it would consequently be advisable to make provision for an alternative to membership, by defining, as from now, the conditions of a privileged partnership."
"That is why I voted against this resolution, refusing to accept this fast track to Turkey’s accession."
".I voted in favour of this report and would like to join with those who have complimented my colleague, Mr Radwan, on the excellent work he has done with members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on this important subject of banks’ regulatory own funds requirements, with the aim of taking account of recent developments on the financial markets."
"It had become necessary to ascertain the coherence between economic capital and regulatory capital within a framework of international convergence of the measurement of these financial data (Basel II)."
"Nevertheless, I pose the question as to whether the time has not come for the financial community of the credit institutions, under the auspices of the ECB and in collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States responsible for banking supervision, to examine which resources should be implemented in order to accelerate the creation of the money supply that is necessary for Europe’s economic development, especially within the euro zone."
"It is a matter of going beyond the practical, monetary and financial success the euro has enjoyed and transforming it from a technical currency into a political currency that serves Europe’s economic development."
". The banking system is one of the key pillars of our market economy, and it is the duty of the public authorities to ensure that its functioning observes clear rules, is transparent and safeguards the customers’ interests."
"In a market that, naturally, cannot be completely assessed by the consumers, it is therefore the public authorities’ responsibility to provide these much-needed guarantees."
"In this context, the capital requirements laid down in the proposal for a directive before us, and the version adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, are entirely in keeping with what I feel are the duties and the appropriate concerns of the public authorities."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"Where this report was concerned, I voted against, or abstained from voting on, quite a few parts to do with Parliament’s competence."
"The report contained quite unnecessary references to the Constitution, which is now defunct."
"I believe that a certain freedom to pursue one’s own financial policy is important, especially so as to be able, in sparsely populated districts, to contribute to credit guarantee associations capable of bringing about cooperation at local level."
"I abstained in those cases where perfectly sensible demands were being made in terms of Parliament’s working conditions but where unnecessary references to the Constitution had been slipped in."
". This report is an essential element of the financial services industry, bringing together internationally agreed banking rules."
"The Labour Group has supported the work undertaken by the rapporteur and services of Parliament to ensure that the European Parliament maintains its legal/political powers."
"To this effect, the EPLP can support the measures introduced to enable the right of call-back and sunset clauses contained within this directive, which is not an imposition on national powers."
".After having voted in favour of this text, I would like to join with those who have congratulated my colleague, Mr Doorn, on the excellent work he has carried out with the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"In order to supplement the confidence required in businesses and in their systems of governance, it was very important to provide the European Union with rules on the subject, drawing inspiration from the international standards derived from global best practice."
"The aspects connected to the independence of auditors have a crucial bearing on the quality of the controls."
"In particular, it was becoming a matter of urgency to define the concept of ‘network’."
"Finally, I will be very attentive and request that the issue of the liability of auditors be looked at, as it is unthinkable that they might have unlimited liability and, therefore, be uninsurable as regards the work they carry out."
". I welcome this report which if passed into legislation and properly enforced should prevent an Enron type scandal taking place in Europe and reduce the likelihood in Europe of future Parlamat type situations."
". Annual accounts and consolidated accounts must be subject to efficient and thorough auditing."
"This objective was expressed clearly by the Commission in the proposal it submitted to Parliament, which has been improved substantially by some of the amendments introduced by this report."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"It has come to light that the rules currently in force in this area do not guarantee the key factors in this extremely important task, namely, market transparency and freedom and independence for those carrying out audits, by which I mean properly carrying out audits."
"This is hardly healthy for the economy."
"In the absence of such factors, action must be taken to rectify the legal framework relating to the proposals concerned."
"As I said, I believe that the Commission’s proposal, along with the amendments tabled by this Chamber, will enable this objective to be met."
"Europe needs its railways, mainly for environmental reasons but also for the transport of freight and passengers."
"That requires railway markets to be opened up between countries so that trains can travel quickly and smoothly across borders."
"The markets for the transport of freight by rail are now being opened up in accordance with the second railway package, and that is something of which we approve."
"Mr Jarzembowski’s report now proposes that passenger services too, both international and national, be opened up, with a particular timetable being followed."
"We believe that it will be possible for international passenger services to be opened up within a few years’ time."
"When, however, it comes to national passenger services, we believe that the process needs to take place over a longer period than that proposed."
"We are not, therefore, at present prepared to vote in favour of Mr Jarzembowski’s proposal regarding the deregulation of national passenger services because we cannot foresee the consequences of his proposal where, for example, local and regional public transport is concerned."
". Along with the other Portuguese Socialists, I welcome the general thrust of the Jarzembowski report, as we are in favour of the principle of opening up the international passenger services market."
"In the debate, however, we have expressed some reservations and objections to the plan to bring forward the liberalisation of international transport, including cabotage, to 2008, and the plan to liberalise national transport services from 1 January 2012."
"It is true that the liberalisation of international transport has the potential to help revitalise rail transport, by fostering its growth and putting it on a more equal footing with air and road transport."
"It is also true, however, that if services are liberalised in unchecked, haphazard fashion at European level, this could lead to serious problems for some Member States such as Portugal, where specialised infrastructure, such as high-speed rail links and the management models thereof, has yet to be put in place. Furthermore, the provision of public service in the area of transport, which is a key factor in employment and economic growth, remains to be guaranteed."
"We therefore voted against all of the provisions on the above-mentioned forms of liberalisation, and this was reflected in our final vote."
". A glance through the demands set by the European Employers’ Confederation (UNICE) on the liberalisation of passenger rail transport (press release, 21 January 2005) reveals the reason behind the position that has been taken by the majority in this Chamber."
"Despite welcoming the Commission’s proposals on the new wave of rail transport liberalisation, UNICE is calling for more, and faster."
"It is calling for the ‘opening up of the markets’ throughout the passenger rail transport sector, and not only international transport, as the Commission’s proposal had envisaged for this stage."
"UNICE also highlighted the position previously adopted by the majority in Parliament to open up passenger rail transport as early as 2008."
"Yet again, the majority in Parliament (and that includes the votes of MEPs from Portugal’s Social Democrats, People’s Party and Socialist Party) is pandering to the demands of Europe’s captains of industry, by approving the liberalisation of international passenger transport in 2008, and national passenger transport in 2012. What is more, Member States can even bring these dates forward."
"Accordingly, we are extremely disappointed that our proposal to block this fresh step in the liberalisation of rail transport was rejected, and will continue to strive to defend public rail transport services and the working conditions of employees in the sector."
".I shall be voting against the report by Mr Jarzembowski, which establishes a new stage of deregulation for rail transport."
"The ‘opening up’ of the freight market was already a threat for the public rail services but the shift to opening up passenger services is unacceptable and fraught with consequences for the users and for planning and development in Europe."
"On the grounds of ensuring an improvement in the organisation of international traffic, the Commission and the report are opening up to competition the most profitable railway lines in each country, thus depriving the public services within the Member States of resources that are essential for tariff averaging and for regional development in relation, for example, to less profitable routes."
"While in a large number of countries in the European Union, the passenger routes are operated well, this decision will make their future less certain and reduce the governments’ investment capacities."
". Whilst savings continue to be made and both regional railway services and international railway connections continue to be cut, politicians of every hue insist that more passengers and more freight should be transported by rail."
"The recipe for that is freight traffic on the roads and competing low-cost airlines in aviation."
"They separate the management from the rails and the implementation from the provision of services, and hope that private companies will bring lower prices, provide a customer-friendly service and attract more customers."
"I think that that approach will ultimately fall short of expectations."
"Their only interest will be in reducing costs by closing down lines, thinning services, increasing charges and discouraging the many loss-making customers."
"The Savary and Sterckx reports offer insufficient compensation for Mr Jarzembowski’s liberalisation plans."
"The Savary report is desperately needed to drive back the technical problems involving cross-border trains, such problems having occurred since electrification."
"The Sterckx report thrusts aside the possibility of forcing railway companies into making cross-border services more accessible and maintaining them."
"The only people who are left better off are those with disabilities."
". I voted in favour of the outstanding Jarzembowsi report, because I feel that, by promoting competition and the creation of a genuine internal market for rail transport, it constitutes a positive step towards revitalising rail transport."
"It is essential that the downward trend in rail transport’s market share be reversed, and we must be resolute in our efforts to achieve this, by building an open, competition-based market."
"As regards the Commission’s proposal to allow rail companies access to the infrastructure of all Member States for the purpose of operating international passenger transport services by 2010 at the latest, the rapporteur includes national services in the opening up of the market, so as to offset the inevitable reduction in the cost-effectiveness of international services and the enormous barrier that this presents to entering the market."
"Moreover, within the context of opening up the networks to passenger rail transport, our proposal is to give the Member States the right to restrict the opening up of the market in certain cases in order to maintain the economic viability of a rail service of public interest."
"I feel that the main gaps in the Commission’s proposal have been plugged and wish to restate my positive opinion and vote on this report."
". I voted against this proposal that European Member States should be obliged to open up all railway networks to private companies by 2012."
"First of all, what we need is an extensive evaluation of the different Member States’ past experiences of railway liberalisation."
"Both the Commission proposal and the Jarzembowski report are premature and lack a solid basis."
"The proposed directive fails to provide binding agreements in relation to the quality of services, security or environmental requirements."
"In addition, the same form of liberalisation of the rail network is imposed on all EU countries, which differ widely in terms of the position from which they would start and of the way in which their railways are used."
"This makes it necessary to list the forms of rail liberalisation that have worked in the past and those that have not."
"There is also the issue of whether Europe can indeed add value to the way in which Member States can, in future, make their national railways more efficient, more customer-friendly and more environmentally-friendly."
"It may be the case that, once the situation in the different Member States has been assessed, we will have no choice but to admit that this subject should ideally be tackled at national level after all, because each situation is unique."
"For the time being, I refuse to endorse the wild liberalisation plans that are now before us."
". – An attempt is being made with the 'third railway package' to deal a final blow to rail transport in order to increase the profits of big business."
"Speeding up the liberalisation of the market in both international and national railway services and the full liberalisation of all passenger services will, on the one hand, increase the profits of the monopolies and, on the other hand, will deal a heavy blow to workers' rights, will increase ticket prices and freight costs and will lower safety standards, as has been the case wherever privatisation has been applied."
"In order to secure the workers' consent and make it easier to sell off the wealth of the grass roots to the monopolies, the proposal is embellished with provisions about possible compensation for passengers in the event of poor services."
"The question is how, starting from the 'fillet', private companies will exploit the workers, the travelling public and the areas in question by bringing a basic lever of transport under their absolute control."
"In the name of competitiveness, more public investment is being called for in infrastructure which will be operated by big business."
"The workers will fight to overturn the anti-grass roots policy of the ΕU, for radical change and for a policy under which rail transport will be social property and will add to grass-roots prosperity."
"The June List is opposed to the Commission’s proposal to create common rules for train drivers and crews."
"Cooperation must be based on trust and intergovernmental agreements."
"We are therefore abstaining from voting on all the amendments and should ideally have liked there to have been the opportunity also to vote against the Commission’s original document."
".This September 2005 we are voting on a ‘railway package’."
"However, for rail workers, passengers, public service and the train stations in our small rural towns, this is not a ‘gift package’."
"It is all very well to worry about an international certificate for train drivers, to talk about competition between road and rail and to want European passengers’ rights."
"In France, however, the TGV will reach Nice only in 2020, two years after a permanent space station has been built on the moon."
"Train stations are closing or are falling into disrepair like in Sainte-Gabelle, not far from Toulouse, while the Paris-Bordeaux-Pau-Madrid line, together with the Paris-Montpellier-Perpignan-Barcelona line, still do not exist."
"Thousands of kilometres of rail tracks are no longer maintained, forcing the TERs to travel at 80 km/h instead of at 120 km/h. In Tarascon sur Ariège, the train station only opens at 3.00 p.m. for one train – the Tour de Carol-Toulouse – that departs at 2.50 p.m. …"
"Thus, when Europe’s rail system is deteriorating to the standard of UK railways, what is urgently needed is a massive rail plan in order to link up finally, in the next decade, the 25 European capitals with high-speed rail lines."
"I voted for the Savary Report as a London MEP having had discussion with rail Trade Unionists as the report creates a system of certificates for train crews to show they meet professional, medial and linguistic standards for those train drivers working across borders."
"With sufficient training such an advance would protect passengers in health and safety terms on rail journeys across EU countries."
". The purpose of the Savary report is to clarify and simplify the Commission’s proposal establishing harmonised European conditions for the certification of train drivers with a view to the opening-up of the rail transport of goods and passengers."
"This proposal for a directive provides for a two-tier certification system for all train drivers and staff involved in driving trains throughout the European rail network."
"The mutual recognition of train drivers’ training is essential if we are to promote the free movement of workers, given that by establishing common standards we will facilitate the situation and help towards making these workers more employable."
"Accordingly, I voted in favour of the Savary report."
"There exists an intergovernmental organisation for international rail traffic (OTIF) that has already agreed on travellers’ rights."
"There is a charter, signed by the European railway undertakings, involving quality standards for passenger transport by rail."
"We do not believe that the EU should go in and regulate this area."
"If regulation is needed in this area, it needs to be brought about through the national authorities in the countries concerned."
"To vote, as matters stand, in favour of a regulation on minimum compensation for delays to passengers would be a big step to take."
"It might mean increased costs, which the service providers would have to pass on to their passengers, a factor that might further hit this industry hard at a time when it is under pressure from low-cost flights and coach travel."
"We therefore believe that, in this situation, the European Parliament’s report does not propose anything of benefit to passengers in the longer term."
"We are therefore voting against Parliament’s suggested changes to the Commission’s proposal."
"We also wish to reject the proposal itself."
". This report is part of a broader package of measures which seek to improve rail and freight transport across Europe."
"International rail travel within Europe is growing in importance as an environmentally-sound alternative to air travel."
"I therefore welcome this report as a means to provide clarity and workability for business whilst protecting the interests of the millions of people across Europe who depend on rail travel both for work and leisure."
"This report needs to be seen in the context of the wider package however: Over the coming months we must work to ensure that these new laws strike an overall balance between the needs of rail users and the interests of the service providers."
". I am voting for the Sterckx Report because I believe that, as a London MEP and representing one of the biggest transport hubs anywhere in the world, that passengers' rights and obligations have not been clearly set out."
"I believe that passengers' rights should not only apply to international rail passengers, but also to national ones."
"I believe that the minimum compensation guidelines set out by the Committee for unacceptable delays are broadly correct."
"I believe strongly that passengers who hold season tickets and encounter repeated delays or cancellations should receive compensation in the form of free journeys, price reductions or an extension of the period of validity of a season ticket."
". I voted in favour of the Sterckx report."
"The proposal for a regulation on international rail passengers’ rights and obligations proposes minimum standards for providing information to passengers before and during the journey, and rules to be followed in the event of delays, for dealing with complaints and on how to deal with people with reduced mobility."
"I feel that the establishment of these rules clearly stems from the need to establish rules without jeopardising the quality of transport for passengers."
"The text on which we are voting today seeks to improve the coherence and the readability of the text and to simplify some of the wording and definitions."
"In our view, the crux of the proposal lies in the implementation of this framework of passengers’ rights and obligations at both national and international level."
"A further reason why I voted for this report was that it does not propose excessively detailed regulation. Instead, it leaves room for businesses to make commercial decisions and encourages them to come up with new ways of making rail transport more attractive to passengers."
". Passenger rights are essential no matter which mode of transport is used."
"The rights of rail passengers to compensation is a step forward and I welcome the Sterckx report."
"However, in light of recent air passenger rights legislation and its application, there is a need to be clear what rights passengers have and the compensation which they are entitled to."
"It is no use introducing legislation which is then not properly implemented."
"If we are going to be true to our constituents we require well implemented rules."
"Mr President, I believe that it was right for us to liberalise freight transport by means of the second railway package."
"Yet it would now be an additional burden on, and indeed an intervention in, free-market regulatory mechanisms if we were to introduce provisions such as those the Commission has just proposed."
"Either we release the railway undertakings onto the free market or we regulate them: we have to decide."
"For this reason, it would also be sensible to refer the whole report back to the Committee."
"We believe that no EU framework is needed for compensation in the event of delays to freight transported by rail."
"We thus support the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s position and are voting against the Commission’s proposal."
"The intention behind the Commission’s proposal is to encourage the railway undertakings to achieve an improved quality of freight transport and thus to strengthen customer demand."
"We question whether the proposed regulations are desirable and whether they will have the intended effect."
".The 25th anniversary of Solidarity must be, as far as we are concerned, the opportunity to remember that half of Europe, surrendered to Stalin’s USSR, endured the terror of Communism for nearly 50 years."
"We must not only celebrate the courage and the memory of the workers of Gdansk and the role played by their strike in the fall of the Iron Curtain."
"We must also celebrate the courage of the rebels of Berlin, Prague and Budapest, who were crushed by the Soviet tanks, as well as the courage of all those who fought for their freedom and the independence of their countries, despite the persecutions, arbitrary arrests, confinements in psychiatric hospitals and deportations to the Gulag."
"We must remember that Communism is the bloodiest ideology in history and that it was responsible for 100 million deaths."
"Nor must we forget that, when they were not actually a party to events, too many leaders and political officials in the West during those ‘iron’ years closed their eyes to what was going on or kept quiet."
"Their successors are today acting in the same manner in relation to the last great Marxist dictatorship on the planet, by forgetting the deaths on Tiananmen Square and the rehabilitation camps."
". The compromise resolution does not express our political view on the 25th anniversary of Solidarnosc, so this is our declaration of vote."
"We condemn the oppressive so-called communist system that was ruling Poland after the Second World War."
"We supported the workers' movement and Solidarnosc in their struggle in the 1980s for better working conditions, social justice and true democracy."
"Poland is today a political democracy mainly thanks to the struggle of Solidarnosc."
"There is still a need for a strong trade union movement in today's Poland, since the workers' rights and social justice are far from being guaranteed in Poland's neo-liberal economic system."
". I have voted in support of the joint draft resolution marking the 25th anniversary of the Solidarity movement and its legacy for Europe."
"The 25th anniversary of the Polish trade union movement Solidarity is an important date to remember, and not only for Poland."
"Its basic message – solidarity in a pan-European context – also deserves the attention of the European Parliament."
"On the one hand, it represents an important signal, since this movement led by Lech Walesa epitomises the courage of the Polish nation in opposing a totalitarian regime under the shadow of the Soviet empire."
"On the other hand, it provides a shining example of values such as solidarity, freedom, peace and human rights – a legacy for Europe as a whole."
"If we are to pay due attention to the historical events that led to the demise of the Berlin Wall, to the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia and to the independence of the Baltic countries, we must not forget the victims of totalitarian regimes and, at the same time, we must truthfully present this history to a younger generation that has never experienced totalitarianism."
"This MEMENTO of totalitarianism provides a sombre warning to those who yearn for its return, as well as a source of strength for those nations that continue to endure it up to the present day."
"At the same time, it serves to remind us of a great man, John Paul II."
"His words – Do not fear! – resounded in Gdansk and, during his pontificate, left an indelible imprint on the hearts and minds of people all over the world."
". Almost a year and a half after the accession of ten new Member States, eight of which were on the other side of the Iron Curtain, the 25th anniversary celebrations of the creation of the Solidarity union have a special significance."
"This was a feat achieved by brave men, by men of freedom. It was also a feat of a time that was marked by the politics of courage, by world leaders with vision and by a Pope – who should not be overlooked – with a genuine determination to free the human race."
"As Lech Walesa has said in recent interviews, heroic though that movement was – and indeed it was – we could not have imagined that 25 years later we would be sitting here alongside MEPs from eight – or rather ten since yesterday – of the countries that had been dominated by the Soviet Empire."
"Let us therefore remember this date to honour the heroes of Solidarity and Poland, and to commemorate the starting point of the process of freeing a large section of Europe that was ‘under occupation’."
"Mr President, I seem to have a monopoly today."
"I should like to emphasise with regard to this report, however, that the territorial component must increase the European added value, otherwise there is no justification for pumping so much money into the regions."
"At the same time, however, we must take care to retain and even promote the variety of regional development."
"In this regard, I should like to make a particular plea for support for the role of the regional authorities, so that they can respond to people’s needs on the spot."
". From a country’s perspective, territorial cohesion means combating inter-regional economic and social disparity and combating the cluster effect; in other words, promoting harmonious and homogenous development throughout a country’s territory."
"In this context, territorial cohesion encompasses economic geography and forms part of the objectives of any structural policy."
"Its inclusion at Community level alongside the objective of economic and social cohesion is only significant because for some people it underpins the federal notion of an EU ‘State’ as a territory."
"We therefore feel that the report ought to focus on regional disparities within each Member State, which are currently either showing no sign of improvement or worsening."
"The report should also be looking into the need for new policy to combat, rather than encourage, these disparities, which entails promoting public services, developing production apparatus, guaranteeing basic infrastructure (transport, communications and energy), ensuring that there is a large network of small and medium-sized holdings and establishing a support strategy for small and medium-sized urban centres in interior, rural and outlying regions."
"For this to happen, better resources must be made available and a genuine cohesion policy put in place."
"We therefore regret the fact that our proposals were rejected."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Guellec on his important and timely report on the role of territorial cohesion in regional development, which has my backing. I particularly welcome the paragraph on the need to apply this concept across the various Community policies, with the aim of improving the coordination of territorial planning in Europe."
"In order to set out appropriately the EU’s action in this area, and the level of intervention in each region, the report calls for the creation of new territorial criteria and indicators, alongside GDP, for measuring development in a particular region and for assessing the obstacles hindering that development, namely specific territorial constraints, a remoteness and accessibility index, infrastructure and transport provision, the amount of research, innovation, education and training and the level of diversification of productivity in the area."
"Not even rural areas are spared globalisation, enlargement and demographic development; on the contrary, they tend to be particularly susceptible to the challenges of the 21st century."
"Many issues cannot be resolved by local authorities alone, which is why cooperation with other municipalities and the participation and involvement of the public rank among the basic principles of rural development."
"Maintaining quality of life in rural areas and fostering people’s attachment to their homeland are essential to bringing migration from the land under control."
"Economic attractiveness and lasting economic opportunities are as important in this regard as economical land use, conservation, awareness-raising at local level and adequate infrastructure."
"Various village contests and town-twinning partnerships have proven their worth in giving impetus to this living space, which is home to two-thirds of all Austrians, for example."
"Rural areas cannot, therefore, be sustained by agricultural subsidies alone, especially as the EU policy under which they are granted has so far done little to foster employment, instead, to some extent, further accelerating this migration: despite large subsidies, many farms are closing and not all members of future generations can make a living on the farm."
"Ensuring vibrant rural areas requires, in particular, that we boost organic enterprises and give smaller businesses a better chance of survival."
"Under no circumstances must there be a cut in subsidies for less-favoured areas: areas which make up 71% of the agricultural land area in Austria, for example."
". To my mind, the importance of territorial cohesion in the EU, and the need for EU policy to promote it, goes without saying."
"At macro-level – that is, between the various countries – territorial cohesion is very much a reality in the Union and one of its raisons d’être."
"If this works at macro-level, it will also work at the most local level, given that as far as values are concerned, there is no difference whatsoever between the two levels."
"I therefore welcome Mr Guellec’s initiative, in that, as well as expressing valid principles, he also identifies sectors and puts forward practical policies that could provide real help towards achieving greater territorial cohesion in the EU."
"Mr President, the Member States must meet their financial commitments and adopt the Financial Perspective as soon as possible."
"Apart from that, the outermost regions can of course receive the funds to which they are entitled."
"At the same time, however, we should appeal to these regions to spend the funds wisely – on education and infrastructure, in particular – so that the taxes paid by our fellow European citizens are put to legitimate use."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to abstain on the issue of a stronger partnership for the outermost regions."
"Many European regions have special needs and difficulties because they are very distant from commercial centres, are sparsely populated or have difficult terrains and climates."
"The islands and groups of islands in the outermost regions face acknowledged difficulties, and we support EU policy in this area."
"Partnership with the EU also involves obligations to fish carefully, protect our common environment and use EU subsidies responsibly."
"We think that the Marques report goes too far in its demands for more subsidies for agriculture and fisheries."
"We have therefore chosen to abstain from voting."
"We are voting in favour of the overall report on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions."
"We are doing so because we recognise the special situation faced by the outermost regions, and we accept their need for Community support."
"We have, however, been obliged to vote against some parts of the report."
"We have done this mainly because we do not think that the outermost regions should have special status and, thus, receive support that runs fundamentally counter to the Community’s other policies and values."
"We voted against proposals that defend an outdated agricultural and fisheries policy which benefits neither the Community’s interests as a whole nor the long-term interests of the outermost regions."
"Protectionism, tariffs and trade barriers are not lasting solutions."
"Support for the outermost regions must be based on sustainable development."
". I voted in favour of it and called for it to be adopted."
"Albeit from differing perspectives and with varying approaches, we have joined forces to support the strategy proposed by the Commission for the sustainable development of the outermost regions. The proposal covers the priorities, the instruments and, most importantly, the creation of a ‘Specific Programme of compensation for additional costs’ and the establishment of a ‘wider neighbourhood action plan’."
"Although there is global agreement on the strategy, criticisms and reservations remain, due to the fact that it falls short of clearly addressing the needs of the outermost regions."
"Consequently, I agree with the rapporteur that the following priorities must be emphasised:"
"1 to accord preferential treatment to the outermost regions with regard to the conditions of access to the Structural Funds within the framework of the revamped cohesion policy; in light of their particular constraints, they should be granted priority financial aid, regardless of their income level;"
"2 to increase the budgetary allocation to the Specific Programme, to be distributed fairly, in view of the constraints that they face; and"
"3 to clarify the action plan in the context of the future ‘European territorial cohesion’ objective of the revamped cohesion policy, and in the context of the Union’s neighbourhood policy."
"We feel that the report does not go far enough on two points that we consider to be crucial: the creation of a Community programme for the outermost regions and the defence of the sovereignty of their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs)."
"We therefore proposed that the Commission be called upon to create a specific Community programme to support the outermost regions, with sufficient financial resources (the financial resources proposed by the Commission in its proposal on the outermost regions in its proposed financial framework for 2007-2013 fall short of what is needed and must be increased), to offset permanent structural disadvantages (and not constraints, as the rapporteur puts it), a programme that would act as a unifying instrument to bring together all of the currently dispersed measures."
"We also believe that in order to ensure the sustainability of fish stocks in the EEZs concerned and to preserve fishing activities in the outermost regions, it is essential that exclusive competence regarding access to the waters of the outermost regions be equivalent to access to its EEZ, in compliance with the national jurisdiction in question."
"Lastly, given that most of the territory in these regions is covered by nature reserves and other protected areas, we feel that there should be permanent measures for the outermost regions in this area."
"We regret that these proposals were rejected by the majority in Parliament."
". As Mr Marques correctly points out, the specific nature of the outermost regions – of which Portugal has two, making this issue particularly significant to such a small country – has led the Commission to take the initiative of proposing policies directly geared towards these regions, with the aim of improving living conditions and making the most of their economic potential."
"The special geographical circumstances of the outermost regions do not necessarily place them at a disadvantage; or to put it another way, they do not have to be a hindrance to development."
"It is simply a matter of pursuing the right policies, such as those advocated in the report before us."
"For these reasons, I voted in favour of this report."
"The June List chooses to vote against these reports because they are two new examples of the way in which, through its own-initiative reports, the European Parliament wishes to provide the EU with new areas of competence."
"Mr Guellec wishes to add a territorial dimension, the aim of which is to clarify how the Member States are to handle relations between the centre and the periphery."
"Mr Marques seeks more funding for fisheries, agriculture, banana production etc in order further to promote the EU’s outermost regions."
"The report discusses the importance of extra subsidy for the fishing industry, partly through investment in modernising the fishing fleet with a view to increasing its profitability."
"These two reports would also lead to new expenditure, and they sanction areas of subsidy that should be reduced rather than extended."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on oil price rises and dependence on oil."
". Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to address Parliament today on this important and timely issue."
"The developments we have seen in the oil market over the past few years raise both important issues and, at present, a number of key issues for the European Union."
"Sustained high oil prices represent a significant risk to global economic growth and are a particularly damaging aspect for poorer countries."
"Access to reliable and affordable supplies of oil is vital for the European Union and the wider global economy."
"In 2003, oil products comprised 43% of total energy consumption in the European Union."
"The importance of this issue was highlighted by the recent informal Ecofin meeting in Manchester, in the United Kingdom, which, when discussing the current economic situation, focused in particular on the impact of oil prices."
"However, as has been well documented elsewhere, the current situation is different from previous periods of high oil prices."
"In real terms, current price levels are lower than the peaks seen in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the pace of the rise in prices has been slower."
"This reflects the fact that very strong, and unexpected, global oil demand growth, rather than supply shock, has been the driving force behind higher prices."
"Because of this increased demand, global production and refining capacity has become very tight."
"So what can be done to help improve present market conditions?"
"Oil is a global issue and can only be solved by global action."
"Both oil producing and oil consuming nations have shared interests and responsibilities in delivering more stable oil prices that enable sustainable economic growth."
"Consumer and producer countries and international organisations need to work together to help make international oil markets function more effectively, both on the demand and on the supply side."
"Open, transparent and competitive oil prices and oil markets are the most effective mechanism for delivering reliable oil supplies at those more stable prices."
"The reserves are there to meet future demand."
"The world is not yet running out of oil or gas any time soon."
"However, action is needed to ensure that reserves are turned into actual supplies."
"Greater investment is needed in both production and refining capability."
"A climate more conducive to investment, with open markets, transparent business practices and stable regulatory frameworks, is required throughout the international oil sector."
"Energy conservation and efficiency, and technology and innovation are also important and have a role to play."
"At Gleneagles, G8 Heads of Government published a plan of action on these issues in addressing climate change, but progress in these areas can also do much to enhance energy security."
"Ultimately, market mechanisms will ration the remaining supplies of oil and provide an incentive for a shift to alternative sources of energy, but appropriate action can be taken in support of that and to promote energy efficiency."
"Energy efficiency is rightly at the top of the European Union energy policy agenda at present."
"Improving energy efficiency within the European Union is the most cost-effective means of simultaneously reducing energy demand – to promote security of supply and improve the competitiveness of European business – and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"Much has already been achieved by the European Union, it is right to acknowledge that in this sphere, with a range of regulatory and voluntary measures now in place, but it is clear that whilst significant potential for further improvements in energy efficiency remains, there are also barriers to now realising that potential."
"That is why Member States have welcomed the high priority that Commissioner Piebalgs has attached to making further progress and the recent publication of the Green Paper on energy efficiency, entitled 'Doing More with Less'."
"That Green Paper is currently stimulating considerable and – I would suggest – welcome discussion and debate as to how barriers can be overcome in order to deliver significant energy savings by 2020."
"It is also why the United Kingdom Presidency will strive to secure a second reading agreement between Council and Parliament on the Energy End-Use Efficiency Directive, which will set a framework and targets for energy efficiency savings in the European Union over the coming years."
"The European Union has introduced the Biofuels Directive to encourage the development of alternative renewable fuels for transport."
"Member States have agreed to set indicative targets for biofuels sales in 2005 and for 2010 to help reduce European Union dependence on fossil fuels."
"Member States across the Union have introduced policies such as reductions in fuel duty and these have stimulated rapidly growing biofuels sales."
"Fuel cells and hydrogen offer significant potential in the longer term, with many considering hydrogen fuel cells to be the ultimate replacement for oil and the internal combustion engine."
"The European Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Platform has carried out sterling and important work in preparing a strategic research agenda and a deployment strategy for fuel cells and hydrogen."
"This work will, in turn, influence the Commission in determining priorities for funding under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The Commission is currently soliciting industry support for a joint technology initiative in this area to allow major hydrogen demonstration projects to be undertaken here within the European Union."
"Greater market transparency is also needed."
"Improved data on global oil demand, supply and stocks is essential for better informed market decisions."
"To this end, European Union members are contributing data to the Joint Oil Data Initiative, due to be launched in Riyadh later this year."
"The European Commission is also currently working on the improvement of data, notably for oil stocks for Europe."
"Lack of transparency over the world’s oil reserves and plans for their development also undermine stability and cause uncertainty."
"Greater clarity and consistency is needed in worldwide reporting of reserves."
"Increased dialogue and understanding between consumers and producers is, frankly, also important."
"The European Union now has a formal dialogue with OPEC, enabling an exchange of views on energy issues of common interest."
"The first meeting in June agreed four themes for enhancing cooperation between the European Union and OPEC."
"These were: oil market developments, in both the short and medium-to-long terms; energy policies; energy technologies; and energy-related multilateral issues."
"Discussions on these themes will be developed through workshops and other meetings, helping to inform future dialogue meetings."
"In the first instance, a round table on oil market developments will take place on 21 November, concentrating on investment needs along the oil supply chain."
"The European Union is also currently engaged in dialogues with Norway, Russia, China and India."
"The energy dialogue with Russia is a good example of effective cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation on an issue of great importance to their overall relationship."
"The basic idea behind the dialogue is a simple balancing of interests: Russia requires European investment to develop its energy resources, whilst Europe needs secure, long-term access to Russian oil and gas."
"Whilst given their rapidly growing need for oil and gas supplies to fuel growth, it is crucial for the European Union, in achieving both its energy security and climate change objectives, that we engage in constructive dialogue and practical cooperation with the emerging economies of both China and India."
"Finally, I should also say something today about the response to the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the oil market, and the part played in this by the European Union."
"The International Energy Agency called on its member states to release 2 million barrels of oil a day over 30 days."
"Although it is many years since the International Energy Agency’s response measures have been tested, the organisation was able very quickly to reach a view that the disruption to the world markets was large enough to justify releasing stocks, and to reach agreement with its member states that stocks should be released."
"The IEA proceeds by unanimity."
"This agreement was a remarkable achievement and a tribute to all those concerned."
"It demonstrates the merits of the IEA’s multilateral approach and the need for such an approach when dealing with the global oil market of today."
"Not all European Union Member States are members of the IEA."
"However, the EU Oil Supply Group met to allow all Member States to review their intended response and give those who are not members of the IEA an opportunity to contribute to that broader discussion."
"The IEA Governing Board, at its meeting on 15 September, reviewed the contributions of its member states to the release of stocks."
"It also decided that no further action was immediately necessary and that the position could be reviewed again at the end of this month or in early October to see if any further action is needed."
"The release of stocks has improved the supply situation and had a calming effect on the market and on prices."
"It was clearly the right thing to do, and done to the right timetable."
"EU Member States, as well as taking part in the release of stocks, were able to increase gasoline exports to the United States, while ensuring that European Union markets remained supplied without any domestic shortages."
"Given the current climate, this debate is extremely timely."
"The European Union is already making an important contribution to improving conditions in the oil market, both in the short and medium-to-long terms, but there is a range of challenges ahead."
"I would now take the opportunity to invite others to contribute their thoughts to that future work."
". Mr President, the European Commission is highly concerned about the current situation in the oil market, characterised by a strong rise in prices."
"The underlying cause for these high prices is the increasingly tight balance between supply and demand, mainly due to a strong growth in the demand for oil over the last years, particularly in the United States and China, and, as a result, the current significant lack of spare crude production and refining capacities."
"In fact, in 2004, there was the largest worldwide increase in oil demand ever."
"In such circumstances – where there is limited spare capacity – specific events, such as the war in Iraq and Hurricane Katrina, fuel speculation, pushing prices ever higher."
"Because these high prices are beginning to have a significant negative impact on the wellbeing of our citizens, particularly the most vulnerable, and upon our economy, the Commission as well as the Member States must focus its efforts on this challenge."
"Whilst, of course, the Commission alone cannot solve this problem, I believe that it can make a significant contribution towards bringing prices to more reasonable levels."
"This is essential for EU citizens, but also for the vulnerable populations in developing countries for whom the impact is ever more devastating."
"Following in-depth debates within the College and with the full support of my colleagues, and in particular President Barroso, I have recently presented a five-point plan of measures that the Commission is already taking, and which will now be accelerated to deal with this challenge."
"Our first action must be to save energy and to reduce demand."
"Since I took office I have made this my first priority."
"The Commission has already adopted a Green Paper on Energy Efficiency in June 2005, which identifies the potential for Europe to save as much as 20% of its existing energy use in a cost-effective manner."
"Existing legislation, when fully implemented, could achieve some 10% energy savings."
"The Commission is therefore taking measures to accelerate a European Action Plan on energy efficiency which will follow up the Green Paper with a series of concrete measures to achieve the 20% potential; increasing pressure for the full and rapid implementation of the new Buildings Directive, and pushing strongly for an agreement on the proposal for an Energy Services Directive."
"However, for Europe alone to save energy will not provide an answer."
"The real challenge is to use the good example developed in Europe to push for energy policies abroad that also focus on constraining demand rather than simply increasing the supply of oil and gas."
"In this context, the European example can illustrate how increased energy efficiency can reduce production costs."
"I am making this my priority in my bilateral contacts with other major energy-consuming nations and through the International Energy Agency."
"At the same time, we are sensitive to the specific situation of the heavily oil-dependent and vulnerable developing countries."
"Our second action must be to increase Europe's use of alternative forms of energy."
"The most logical response to high oil prices is to switch to using alternative, competitive and, wherever possible, more environmentally friendly energy sources."
"For instance, the energy potential of biomass in the EU needs to be developed."
"A Biomass Action Plan will be tabled before the end of the year."
"We should also boost research on wind, wave and solar energy, hydrogen – in particular with respect to transport – and on clean coal and carbon sequestration, and I shall be arguing for proper funding of this in the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The proper implementation of the Biofuels Directive can also be fruitful in this sense."
"Finally, before the end of 2005, the Commission will present a communication on financial support schemes for renewable energy sources."
"Furthermore, we should work actively to build global alliances to explore more viable use of renewable energy sources, especially in the developing world."
"Thirdly, we must increase the transparency and predictability of the oil markets."
"The lack of transparency on world oil markets facilitates speculation and inhibits investment in the oil sector."
"The Commission will pursue several actions to address this situation, such as accelerating the creation of a European Energy Market Observation System within the Commission."
"The aim of this observation system would be to provide reliable information to facilitate investments of private operators in the energy sector, as well as to improve decision-taking by policy makers."
"The Commission will also speed up measures to make its services able to publish data on the level of European oil stocks on a more regular basis."
"Fourthly, we must increase the supply of oil and gas."
"Whilst priority must be given to reducing demand and switching from oil, it would be wrong not to recognise the fact that the world will need more oil and more refining capacity."
"To this end, the Commission will strengthen producer-consumer dialogue with oil-producing countries, including OPEC."
"This dialogue was already initiated this spring and on Sunday, 18 September, I met the President of the OPEC Conference, Mr Sheikh Fahad al Sabah, in Vienna."
"I conveyed to him our concerns about the current oil situation, as well as the expected cooperation from OPEC."
"In this respect, let me inform you that OPEC has committed to help to stabilise the international oil market and to contribute to bringing oil prices back to sustainable levels."
"In that meeting OPEC emphasised the need for investment along the entire oil-supply chain and, in particular, it pointed out the insufficient refining capacity in the oil market."
"OPEC also declared that it is looking forward to getting more opportunities to invest in the European oil downstream sector."
"On the Commission side, we conveyed to OPEC our concerns about the fact that current insufficient spare capacity contributes to facilitating speculative movements on the international level and creates additional pressure on the oil market."
"Other dialogues with important oil-producing countries – like Russia, Norway and the Persian Gulf countries – with the oil and gas industry and with the main oil-consuming countries in the world – like China, India and the United States – will also be continued."
"A 'China-EU Action Plan on energy efficiency and renewable energies' has recently been set up."
"Finally, I will be meeting shortly with executives from the major oil companies, as I consider it very important that oil companies behave in the most responsible manner given this situation."
"In particular, I will insist on the need for more investment by them, and to determine which additional measures can be taken to remove bottlenecks preventing further investment, particularly in refining capacity."
"Fifthly, we must react effectively to emergency situations with respect to oil stocks."
"In this context, the Commission has supported the proposal of the International Energy Agency on 2 September for increasing oil supply by 2 million barrels per day over a period of 30 days."
"While most of this international collective effort will initially consist of releasing security oil stocks in the international market, the Commission strongly advocates encouraging energy-saving behaviour, which may lead, if needed, to the use of demand restriction measures by Member States if further actions are required."
"This is particularly true if the loss in supply is finally expected to persist for several months."
"As you may know, under EU law, all Member States must keep emergency oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of normal consumption, to be used in the event of short-term physical supply disruptions."
"While the EU has security oil stocks, it has never used them since it has no legal means to do so."
"Europe needs to play its own role, as not all EU Member States are members of the International Energy Agency."
"In this respect, the Commission has already started convening the Community's Oil Supply Group on a regular basis in order to discuss oil prices, the emergency measures taken by Member States and more efficient ways of coordinating emergency measures at Community level."
"Recent events show the clear need for a mechanism that assists in coordinating the use of oil stocks in the European Union."
"The Commission is now considering how best this can be done, and will discuss this with all stakeholders at a new Fossil Fuel Forum I have established, that will meet for the first time in Berlin in October."
"I should note that in developing such a proposal I shall pay careful attention to the view taken by the European Parliament on the previous Commission proposal on this matter."
"As a final comment, I should note that the Commission does not believe that the best reaction to high oil prices is lowering taxes to compensate."
"This only encourages consumers to continue to consume."
"The Ministers at the last informal Ecofin meeting have clearly agreed that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions that prevent the necessary adjustment should be avoided."
"It is a fact that uncoordinated fiscal reductions can have a distorting effect on competition in the internal market."
"In conclusion, the Commission has been very active in proposing measures for remedying the situation."
"It will be a success only if all concerned – European institutions, industry, third countries and international organisations – work together."
"I am determined, therefore, to use the balanced energy policy model developed in Europe as a model for more international change, and to demonstrate our commitment to helping vulnerable populations both in the EU and in developing countries."
". Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I would like to start by commending the Commissioner for his measured approach to this situation and to express in general terms support for the approach he is taking."
"Let us not over-react in haste to a situation that is changing as we speak; prices are moderating to some extent and we should let the market work."
"If there are problems that should be specifically addressed, for example if there are concerns over the poor and vulnerable and disadvantaged, then we should use alternative social measures to assist them and not fall for the short-term fix of cutting tax."
"The fundamentals of our situation remain unchanged: the EU is heavily dependent on oil and heavily dependent on imports of oil."
"We should seek to reduce that dependency through measures of efficiency, conservation, substitution and new technologies."
"There is an important principle that taxes should remain set by Member States."
"This should not be surrendered in favour of the ephemera of an EU-wide tax system."
"It is also important to remember that in the road transport sector by far the largest element of the price of fuel is taxation."
"Therefore, to those who are concerned about the windfall profits of oil companies, I would say perhaps we should be more concerned about the windfall profits of finance ministers or the tax man."
"Finally, I wonder whether in addition to looking at the transport sector and roads, we should be thinking again about the aviation sector, to see whether we could find international agreement on achieving efficiencies and conservation of fuel in that sector."
"At the moment it is by its very nature untaxed."
". – Mr President, I should like to begin my short speech by emphasising that we hold Commissioner Piebalgs in very high regard on account of his efficiency and commitment in driving energy policy forward."
"I am very pleased that he has supported and emphasised that again in recent days, and also that the Presidency has made a number of commitments here on the issue of energy policy."
"Nevertheless, from the point of view of our Group, the words of the Commission or Commission President on this subject have been rather inadequate, for, as Mr Alexander explained, these markets – if one can even call them that – are very lacking in transparency."
"On the other hand, the EU must speak in a clear political language in all fields – from foreign policy to transport policy, from agricultural policy to trade policy."
"This is also – not exclusively, of course – particularly applicable to energy policy."
"I warmly welcome the Commissioner’s statement today, as it goes a little further than our previous discussions."
"He said the same thing this morning in committee."
"On the subject of the oil companies, however – I do not envy them or their shareholders their large profits – I do believe that greater socio-political responsibility for our common society and for the future of the companies themselves is needed."
"It must be recognised, however, that only a small proportion of these profits can be used for increasing investment for their own benefit, for example in the mixing of biofuels, as is now the case in some countries, and also, of course, in research and development in the field of alternative energies."
"The Commissioner said this morning that he is aware that what has been spent up to now is only peanuts."
"I hope that, following the dialogue that you announced here, this will be at least a few more peanuts."
"If you remain Commissioner even longer, there may even, over time, be enough for a cake, an energy cake, which we can offer the European public."
"I wish the Commissioner good luck and a great deal of strength, and I ask him to tell the executives of the major oil companies that Parliament is expecting them to do something for our common society."
". Mr President, I welcome the emphasis that has been given this afternoon to the demand aspects of the oil problem."
"It would be easier for us to focus on the supply side and the difficulties caused by Hurricane Katrina, but if we did that we would just be applying a sticking plaster, when what we really need is major surgery."
"At the bottom of the problem is Europe's over-dependence on oil."
"With a third of EU oil being imported from Russia and a quarter from the Middle East – and those proportions are rising – we face a structural problem which goes far beyond any short-term crisis."
"The simple fact is that we have to cut oil consumption: really cut it, not just talk about cutting it, and we have talked about it a great deal in the context of curbing CO2 emissions."
"But there is still a huge gap between the grand rhetoric about using less oil and the amount of real practical action taking place on the ground."
"I have two specific requests for the Council and Commission today."
"It is welcome news indeed that the UK Presidency is committed to getting an agreement before the end of December on the energy efficiency and energy services directive, but will the Minister assure us today that this will be a directive with big teeth; one which makes serious, binding commitments on energy reduction; one which sets a framework for energy efficiency and stimulates a rapid growth in energy efficiency services across Europe?"
"That is the sort of commitment we need if we are going to tackle the demand side of oil dependency, rather than just talk about it."
"Secondly to the Commission: will the Commission commit to engaging in joined-up thinking on the issues of alternatives to oil?"
"I welcome the forthcoming strategies which Mr Piebalgs mentioned."
"I hope that these will be coming not just from the Energy Commissioner, who we know is deeply committed to promoting energy saving and renewables."
"I hope that there will be wide and integrated Commission strategies to stimulate European action across the board, bringing together policy initiatives on transport, industry, taxation and agriculture."
"In many cases we have the technology, we even have a successful pilot project somewhere in the EU, but what we do not have is the means to roll out the technology and make it mainstream."
"In my own region we have the beginnings of a successful bio-diesel industry in the Tees Valley."
"Very high-yield oil seed rape grows right next to an existing petrochemical industry."
"We already have the start of a 'green route' of filling stations supplying 5% biodiesel, but there is not yet the infrastructure, the capacity, or the tax regime to roll out that biodiesel programme everywhere."
"Biodiesel is just one case where the talking has to stop."
"I am afraid oil demand will not go down unless there is more concrete structural action on both renewables and energy efficiency."
". Mr President, let me first thank the Commissioner for setting the right priorities."
"We live in a world where there will be 150 million cars in China in 2015, whereas today there are only 6 million."
"We have to stop allowing two-ton monsters to transport people who weigh 80 kilograms. So long as we are not serious about efficiency, especially in the transport sector, there will be no answer to oil or to climate change."
"In its resolution tomorrow, Parliament will call for Europe to become the most energy-efficient and least oil-dependent economy by 2020."
"This is a huge opportunity for environment policy and for employment policy."
"For every euro we spend to heat a house with oil, we send money outside Europe instead of investing in insulation and in jobs in Europe."
"As happy as I am with the Commissioner's proposals, as scandalised as I am about the Barroso Commission as a whole, it is ridiculous to come up with a communication on oil without a single sentence on transport, when we all know that transport accounts for 70% of oil consumption in Europe."
"Therefore my question to you, Commissioner, is: when will the Commission come up with a plan under which Mr Barrot, Mr Kovács and Mr Verheugen take on their responsibilities?"
"It is not you alone who have to do so."
"My final question is to the UK Presidency."
"You did not mention the directive on road tolls for lorries."
"That is on the table."
"So if the Council wants to produce not only words but also action, why does the UK Presidency not press for an agreement on road tolls based on the Swiss model?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the problem we have to face is guaranteeing energy supplies to meet the essential requirements of our modern society, while at the same time ensuring a really low environmental impact and reducing public health risks."
"The only answer is to initiate change in order to bring the oil age to an end."
"Even though there are no miracle cures, we have two options on which we must act: energy efficiency and renewables."
"That is the only way in which Europe will be able to guarantee immediate answers both to the supply crisis with its high prices and to the diversification of energy supplies, to reduce our dependency on foreign oil."
"For the planet, that might mean reducing the tensions that lie at the root of many conflicts."
"We have reached a point where our energy system has become too costly compared with its benefits: not only in financial terms – USD 100 a barrel now seems imminent – but also in terms of environmental damage, health risks and the burden of a military and logistical apparatus to guarantee control of production areas and the security of transport worldwide."
"In Europe we have to address the energy crisis through research programmes that can stimulate the technological development of energy systems that are sustainable and competitive – not least in economic terms, so as to create jobs."
"For that reason too, our journey towards an economy based on renewable energy and energy efficiency cannot do without the guiding hand of public investment."
".Mr President, the current high, unstable oil prices may influence global economic growth."
"This would be particularly painful for those European Union Member States that in recent years have not experienced a strong economic upswing, but are being forced to pay a higher price for oil which is dictated by strong economic growth worldwide."
"In several new European Union Member States, the elements of an increase in oil prices produced by the dominant role played by old and energy-wasteful technologies in their economies are also at the basis of growing inflationary pressure."
"At the moment there are no objective preconditions for an increase in the quantity of oil on the market."
"Even if in the next couple of years this were to happen, the geographical location of oil production would not change, in any case, and this means many risks will still remain, and this will not allow the oil price to fall substantially."
"In the same way, there is little hope that the oil-producing countries will have a genuine interest in making the oil market more stable or the ability to work together with oil consumers to achieve this."
"The recent nationalisation of oil companies in Russia and Venezuela, which was ideologically and not economically motivated, has made the oil-producing sector in these countries less transparent and less predictable."
"This is the reality with which we have to deal in forming European Union policy, and not only in the sphere of energy."
"As for the current short-term challenges — in a situation where there are no free oil reserves on the market — the only available tool for stabilising oil is the reduction of consumption."
"Here, we should suspend all forms of subsidy and tax incentives for the oil refining sector and consumers."
"Tax incentives give the wrong signal to the market on the direction of oil prices and encourage consumption, and in the end increase the profits of the oil companies."
"The European Commission, acting in coordination with the bodies that monitor the markets of the Member States, should create a mechanism for monitoring the oil market in order to reduce speculation on the oil market, which lacks transparency."
"Regarding all the action strategies presented that have been planned by the Commission to expand the energy portfolio and to reduce oil dependency in the European Union, I must say that it is vital to look at a substantial increase in funding in the Financial Perspective for the expansion of the energy portfolio."
"Just a few months ago, the institutions of the European Union addressed the issue of energy security in Europe."
"According to one admittedly platonic statement, the dependency of European countries on external energy sources will increase from 50 to 70% in the next twenty years."
"The countries of the European Union do not possess significant natural sources of energy."
"I therefore support measures in favour of increased energy efficiency, alternative and renewable sources of energy, and energy conservation."
"Similarly, I support planned measures aimed at increasing stocks of oil and oil products in the Member States, and a common position for the European Union in talks with OPEC and other countries, aimed at improving the stability of the market for crude oil and energy."
"On the other hand, however, EU institutions must adopt a more forward-looking approach to the closure of existing energy installations."
"In this context, I must criticise the decision, motivated largely by political considerations, to decommission prematurely the nuclear power plant at Jaslovské Bohunice, although the plant meets operational safety requirements."
"This will weaken the energy potential not only of Slovakia, but also of the entire European Union."
"Mr President, we are living in a world starved of energy, where some 1.5 million people have no access to electricity."
"Crises such as the one rocking the oil market demonstrate our over-dependence on fossil fuels."
"We will probably never run out of oil, but the extraction of the remaining oil will become so expensive that our economies will be forced to move away from it: all the more reason to prepare for the post-oil period."
"Energy savings and better energy efficiency are priorities."
"All forms of renewable energy must be encouraged."
"Nevertheless, major technical progress is still needed in order to increase the economic use of ‘clean’ energies."
"Europe must increase investment in all forms of energy research, and in technological developments related to hydrogen."
"The transformation of hydrogen requires a great deal of energy."
"We will not get away from nuclear power straight away."
"I hope that, via ITER, we will achieve fusion."
"In the meantime, coal will remain an important source of primary energy, even though it is necessary to develop cleaner technologies."
"Currently, the erratic movement of the crude market is causing problems."
"The intelligence of this market could be questioned in view of the sudden explosion in the prices caused by the announcement of a cyclone and the sudden collapse of those prices once Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had run out of steam."
"There is too much short-term speculation on this very special market, shaped by a cartel and oligopolies."
"The Commission must follow more closely the predatory activity of certain highly speculative funds and aim to provide greater transparency in the setting of oil prices."
"The citizens of Europe would be grateful for greater regulatory involvement."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank the Commissioner for being here today and for his commitment."
"We discussed the approaches to take this morning, and I agree with his views on the need for a systemic approach to this problem, precisely because we are faced with a huge challenge."
"Oil is running out and so is the ecosystem’s ability to absorb the flows of waste and combustion products."
"We have to bring the oil age to an end – we simply have to – but that means change, and therefore we also need leadership for change."
"We cannot accept the inaction shown by many national governments in this field: that is like taking everything for granted."
"What we can take for granted, in fact, is that oil prices will rise even higher because, given current demand, there is no reason for them to come down."
"We have to take action straight away and already introduce measures along the lines mentioned before: savings, efficiency and diversified sources of energy."
"We have to focus on renewable energies above all, as they are the ones that will enable us to fulfil the commitment we have made to the new generations."
"Besides, leadership implies an ability to steer the process at a cultural level as well, because we can prepare for the real change in demand precisely through a change in culture."
"It is not for the sake of austerity or sobriety, but we can raise our civilisation to new levels by taking the knowledge-based society seriously."
"We must do so systemically, and that is the leadership commitment that we must accept."
"Mr President, the rapid rise in the price of oil has made everyone realise that it will not last forever."
"This has been obvious to thinking people for a long time now, and most recently since the analyses which have been carried out by petroleum geologists with regard to the relationship between demand for oil and the growth in its annual production."
"Now we must focus on developing clean alternatives with a sustainable future, such as renewable energy and improvements in energy efficiency."
"It would be foolish now to squander resources on fossil fuel alternatives which are even dirtier than oil, such as liquid fuel manufactured from coal or oil shale."
"As my colleague, Mr Turmes, said, most oil is used for transport."
"For this reason, we need to rethink our transport system."
"As well as biofuels, we should aim to develop public transport."
"For example, in EU-funded communication investment projects there should be greater emphasis than ever on the railways."
"– Mr President, I am sorry but, despite the fact that the oil crisis has been with us for a year, the Commission's response is, at the very least, relaxed and the Council's is non-existent."
"We have heard today, yet again, excellent pronouncements which, however, are not accompanied by concomitant measures."
"This shows a lack of perspicacity."
"I ask you: have drastic measures been taken to mitigate the dependency on oil?"
"The conclusion is that the increase in oil prices, in conjunction with the natural disasters, due – in great part – to the careless consumption of mineral fuels, imposes the need to abandon an energy-intensive development model and quickly develop alternative forms of energy."
"However, in order to achieve this, we need money and, unfortunately, both the Council and the Commission refuse the idea of a special fuel tax to finance this investment in the future."
"Mr President, while I welcome what has been said by the Council and the Commission, the reality today is that there is an ever-growing demand for fossil fuels."
"In the coming years, Chinese requirements alone will increase to unheard-of levels."
"Eventually they will be competing directly with the US for ever-diminishing supplies, which is a forbidding thought and, as we know, fossil fuels are running out very quickly."
"Alternative energy sources are vital for our future."
"What will it take to make us serious about this?"
"Bioethanol is one of these sources."
"The EU Commission recognises the importance of this industry and the fact that certain agricultural products, including sugar, could be used for producing bioethanol."
"The Commission currently contributes financially to the creation of European biofuel projects."
"Regrettably the take-up and use of these funds by the Member States is still deplorably low."
"More land will become available for alternative use as a result of the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy."
"Our farmers, who are guardians of the rural environment, could and would seriously contribute to controlling climate change by alternative use of agricultural land for the production of alternative and renewable sources."
"Is it not time that we really got serious about this?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when talking about oil we should ask ourselves about the European Union’s foreign policy and its substantive endorsement of the policy of aggression and robbery of energy resources and principal raw materials that is practised by the multinationals and the United States."
"Everything that on the one hand produces wealth and on the other impoverishes the legitimate owners of the resources immediately becomes a target for attempted robbery by the financial and political administrations I have mentioned."
"Nobody here wants to talk about reducing VAT or duty; what, then, can be done to release our peoples from the yoke of dependence on interests outside Europe?"
"1."
"Nationalise resources; 2. strengthen political and economic ties with producer countries so as to become their privileged trading partners; 3. stop supporting or being complicit with US foreign policy; 4. release European research organisations working on alternative energy sources, especially biomass, geothermal and all other renewable energies, from constraints and conditions and instead give them substantial financial support; and 5. monitor the prices that oil companies charge in the various countries of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is important to emphasise that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, too, is in favour of alternative energy, and of such energy not only being promoted, but also made competitive."
"It is unacceptable that it should remain subsidised indefinitely."
"We must put alternative energy on the path towards competitiveness."
"Listening to the debate in this House, I note that here, too, many Members place great trust in the state."
"Members are urging state intervention, basically forgetting that, after all, the oil price in a competitive economy still follows the market."
"It is first and foremost a market price; we have to accept this."
"Yet we are all aware that, ultimately, part of the problem is refinery capacity."
"This is insufficient at the moment, but the situation will change again somewhat."
"When, though, over 70% of fuel prices at the pump in EU Member States such as Germany is accounted for by tax, we Members of the European Parliament must appeal to the national governments to take ad hoc action on this, in order to give the public in high-tax countries, in particular, something back and thus ensure continued mobility in these work-oriented societies."
"This is another demand that is primarily of a political nature."
"One cannot rail against the markets whilst being responsible for 70% of the price oneself; this would be attributing responsibility in the wrong quarters."
"We would therefore be well advised to make it clear that the state should support alternative energy – in moderation – but that we should also invest in new technologies."
"There is a wide range of such options to choose from, for example hybrid-drive systems, amongst others."
"The emphasis here should be on moderation and good sense, however, rather than ideology."
"Mr President, Russia is increasing its cooperation with OPEC."
"The oil producers’ cartel is becoming more powerful than ever."
"The hopes and actions relating to the development of renewable energy sources are not having an effect quickly enough."
"The price of oil remains high, while Europe grows increasingly dependent and crisis-prone."
"While the wind gathers force on one continent, Europe plunges headlong into crisis."
"In the United States of America, wind and water brought a tenth of oil refining activity to a halt, but the price rose by 40%."
"There will be more crises in the future, as the demand for oil and the oil supply are so closely related."
"Companies’ profits ought to be used to develop sustainable alternative forms of energy."
"Demand will go down, therefore, and in its place research, biomass and alternatives."
"We have not, however, tried to draft laws restricting the stock exchange game which raises prices, as my colleague, Mr Goebbels, has said, or lessening the social inequality that results from oil."
"Is the Presidency, which also heads the G8, prepared to hold a summit meeting between the major consumers and sellers as soon as possible, and before the conference of oil ministers next spring?"
"We ought to stabilise oil prices."
"Finally, Commissioner Piebalgs, what is the situation regarding the European Union-Russia Energy Dialogue?"
"Is progress being made?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate of ours today on the oil problem means talking of the difficulties of our current situation – from wars to the exhaustion of non-renewable resources and to environmental damage – and deciding whether we shall have a different future or whether we shall have any future at all."
"The oil crisis is not due to short-term economic factors, as is now obvious; it is linked to the fact that the current social and geopolitical set-up and development models are defunct."
"Finding a way out of it requires fairness, redistribution of wealth, new development paradigms, and new energy policies based on efficiency and on clean, safe, renewable alternatives, the opposite of coal and nuclear."
"Peace, fairness and the environment are the only options that can take us into the future."
"We must make them happen by means of practical policies that are not left to the market but are developed through new political choices and new action in the public sphere."
"Mr President, Energy Commissioner, thank you for being here. Your presence is very appropriate."
"There was undoubtedly a unanimous clamour within the Union with regard to the need to tackle the harsh reality of the rise in the oil price."
"The situation was predictable, but the reality has been much more brutal than was expected."
"The fact is that the forecasts have doubled and crude prices are impacting on economic growth and the well-being of the Union’s citizens."
"The diagnosis is shared and the formulae for alleviating the macroeconomic imbalance within a context of rising crude prices are very similar to each other."
"I am not saying that it is a bad thing that there is agreement in terms of the analysis, but I would say that they are medium and long-term measures and also require will, and that they are insufficient in the short term."
"If you will allow me, I shall not waste time – time which I do not have – saying the usual things."
"Instead, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I would like to draw attention to the extreme situation that the road transport sector has reached, not in a temporary sense, but in a structural sense that will be difficult to resolve."
"We will agree with actions by the States aimed at adopting measures to facilitate the modal change towards more efficient modes of transport."
"We will agree with adopting measures for more efficient use of the different modes of transport and, finally, we will agree with taking measures to increase the energy efficiency of vehicles."
"Having said that, however, you will have to agree with me that in the short term it is not possible to alter reality and that the main victim of the results of this situation is a sector such as transport, which is overly dependent on the evolution of demand and is at the mercy of fluctuations in oil prices."
"The constant rises in the price of crude have led to a sharp increase in companies’ operating costs, placing the sector in a completely impotent situation, given that it is impossible for them to pass the rises on to the prices of the service they provide."
"For all of these reasons, we believe it would be appropriate, without prejudice to the adoption of measures of a general nature with which we will agree, for the Commission, together with the Member States, also to study measures to harmonise downwards the tax on diesel oil for professional purposes and to modulate taxation in a manner that has a serious effect on employment."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as has been said in this Chamber, the transport sector accounts for by far the greater part of total oil consumption in the EU."
"We are all extremely dependent upon oil for transporting goods and for moving about because road transport is so dominant."
"That is something that industry and ourselves have known about for quite some time, but awareness has not led to action."
"We must now make the conversion and embark upon work designed to produce renewable energy sources and fuels."
"Encouraging tendencies can also be seen, however: awareness is increasing and, following Katrina, the US car industry has requested that the President call a summit on what can be done to develop alternative fuels."
"The big car manufacturers also say that the US must reduce its dependency upon petrol."
"We must make use of this awareness and create the relevant basic conditions in our societies and in the EU, and that is of course something that we as politicians can do."
"In the transport area, we must carry out research with a view to producing new renewable fuels, placing our hopes in, for example, synthetic diesel."
"We must favour alternative fuels such as ethanol."
"We must renew the stock of vehicles and, in this area, it is a question of doing quite a lot quite quickly."
"We must also pin our hopes on alternative forms of transport."
"We have talked about the railways today and decided to develop rail traffic."
"That is important but, in overhauling the White Paper, we must also write more, and take more decisions, about alternative fuels and the renewal of our stock of vehicles."
"Mr President, I have come here to talk about a sector that is being particularly affected by this situation: the fisheries sector."
"I agree with the Commission that it is necessary to draw up a medium- and long-term action plan, which enables the fleet to deal with a state of affairs which is evidently structural rather than temporary, although I must also make it clear that I do not deny that some of the solutions which the Directorate-General for fisheries is indicating, for energy saving, such as the scrapping of the Community fleet, are a cause of very great concern to many of us."
"I believe that, when preparing for the future, we must also take account of the present, since the fleet is already in a desperate situation and we are not convinced by the short-term measures indicated at the last Council of Fisheries Ministers."
"The temporary halts of the FIFG have not been designed to deal with this kind of crisis, because the governments, furthermore, have already allocated their funds and reprogramming is problematic."
"Commissioner Borg’s announcement on the increase in de minimis aid does not sort the problem out either, since we will have to wait for nine months and for new Community rules in order for this to be resolved."
"This is leading many Member States to help their sectors as best they can, which also causes significant distortions of competition."
"We would therefore once again call on the Commission, represented here by the Energy Commissioner, as we did a year ago, to enable the fisheries sector to escape from this crisis, which would involve introducing a mechanism that can be brought into play automatically when there are sudden or continuous rises in fuel prices, and that it should be mobilised before fishing companies begin to collapse en masse."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, there are a number of important responses to the current oil crisis."
"I am deeply convinced, however, that the only correct response in the long term is to overcome our dependence on oil, a source of energy that will last for perhaps a further 40 to 60 years, is prone to crises and is increasing in price the scarcer it becomes."
"We can see, therefore, that the alternatives are an obvious choice."
"Energy conservation must come first."
"Studies have shown that savings of 14% in the transport sector and 20% in the building sector are possible, and this without any sacrifices in terms of comfort."
"I am addressing the President-in-Office of the Council when I express my fervent hope that, particularly in this difficult situation, we shall succeed in arriving at a sensible, workable compromise regarding the Directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services."
"A great deal has been achieved in the European Union in the field of renewable energy, but shortcomings remain."
"Nearly half of all energy produced is used for generating heat, a large proportion of this from oil."
"Here, in particular, we see that penetration is not reaching its potential."
"I would urge the Commissioner, therefore, to really present an appropriate directive on this, which sets out clear objectives and produces the relevant measures in the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the present situation with regard to oil prices is highly unsatisfactory."
"On the one hand, consumers are paying very high prices; on the other, windfall profits are being generated, in not only the oil sector, but also other energy sectors."
"I believe that it is our responsibility to discuss the best use to which the companies could put these windfall profits and also, in particular, what the states that benefit the most from them could be doing with these taxes."
"The primary issue must be that this revenue is not being invested in other fields."
"Perhaps the Commission should draw up an action plan for a questionnaire enquiring as to the best use to which the companies and, in particular, the nation-states could put this additional revenue pouring into their coffers."
"One possibility would be to launch a kind of benchmarking and best-practice project to ensure that this revenue is spent on research and development, efficiency measures, tax relief – not on consumption, but in the investment field – on relocations and on the CIP Programme."
"A completely new possibility of embarking on a new path opens up in this regard."
"I believe that we could collect examples of the best way of managing this in the nation-states – and perhaps even at international level."
"The second major issue is as follows: at the present time, invoices are being issued in dollars."
"This may be to our advantage at the moment, but it is also possible for the tide to turn, that is to say, when prices rise further and the dollar changes direction."
"For this reason, we should perhaps consider whether it is possible to create a separate euro zone in the energy sector for non-OPEC countries, or even incentives for the creation of such a zone, because this, too, would bring a certain degree of stability and independence."
"My final point is that, for the hedge funds, we need capital requirements and conditions of liability that are complied with, and ultimately also transparency, in order to suitably prevent unnecessary market speculation in future."
"Mr President, I support those who have realised that dependence on oil must cease through a determined effort to invest in renewable energy sources and energy saving."
"The EU ought to support the breakthrough in new environmental technologies."
"These innovations can help us not only to increase our self-sufficiency in energy, but we can also improve air quality and reduce greenhouse emissions."
"Many of the renewable energy sources that help conserve the environment are already within our reach."
"Biomass can be used in diverse ways for heating, for producing electricity and as fuel."
"So far it is the only renewable energy source which may be used to replace liquid transport fuels."
"The EU should set ambitious targets to reduce dependence on oil and increase savings."
"Renewable energy sources should account for at least 25% of the EU’s entire energy consumption by the year 2020."
"The current energy situation, caused primarily by the oil crisis, compels us to seek a prompt solution."
"It is essential to make the most effective and efficient use of crude oil."
"There can be no doubt that the European Union’s efforts in this direction should include moves to abandon the use of crude oil for producing electricity as soon as possible."
"The time has come to discuss this issue openly."
"Nuclear power is a much more effective substitute for crude oil, in terms of both available production capacity and environmental protection."
"Nuclear power engineering employs the most up-to-date technologies with high safety standards."
"It is, moreover, a clean source of energy that does not produce any CO2 emissions."
"A safe solution has also been found to the problem that opponents of nuclear energy often stress – nuclear waste."
"Investment for research into safe nuclear waste recycling and the further development of new technologies, which the European Union can also provide by enabling access to the 7th Framework Programme, would soon eliminate any doubt concerning the safety of nuclear plants."
"On the other hand, I do not wish to downplay the importance of other alternative sources of electrical energy, particularly those sources that do not produce CO2 emissions."
"However, the seriousness of the current energy situation requires the adoption of the only rational and expedient solution: a return to nuclear power through the construction of new production capacity."
"Commissioner, if you want to cushion the direct impact of the increase in oil prices, it is not good enough to come up with long-term solutions alone."
"We expect the Commission to play a coordinating and supervisory role for short-term measures too."
"It is among the public, particularly the weak, and those on the lowest incomes, that expensive oil claims its victims."
"It is up to each country to take measures in order to alleviate those problems, but the European Commission could coordinate the measures, by for example allowing VAT at the reduced rate within its field of competence."
"The Commission is also sceptical about support to industries that are hit by high oil prices, especially the transport industry, but also the fisheries industry, and in these too, it could play an important role in coordinating the changeover to energy-friendly equipment."
"Many fishermen lack the financial resources to cover those costs, and that is why I should like to ask you to redouble your support in order to bring this changeover about."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like firstly to congratulate the Energy Commissioner on his speedy reaction to the extreme and recent volatility of oil prices represented by this plan, the main points of which he has explained to us today and the basic ideas and concrete measures of which I fully accept."
"The price of crude rose by 50% last year and this increase has led to a notable deterioration of the competitiveness of our economy."
"Many governments are therefore subject to strong pressure to reduce the tax on oil in certain transport sectors."
"As the Commissioner has said, however, that is not the solution."
"As well as creating distortions in the market and problems with the rules on State aid, it opens the way to possible increases in consumption and future rises in the barrel price."
"We must adopt the measures that the Commissioner indicated in the plan: decisive promotion of the use of renewable energies and improving efficiency, increasing refining capacity, combating speculative movements, considering nuclear energy as an essential element of the security of supply strategy and promotion of the use of biofuels."
"We are debating a crisis today, but we must draw sufficient strength from it to plan for our future in an intelligent manner."
"I do not wish to end without asking the Council, the representative of which is currently looking at a piece of paper with immense interest, to consider very seriously the effects of an intolerable reduction in the funds dedicated to technological research and innovation in the seventh framework Programme given the current circumstances."
"Mr President, the energy system is vital and is of a global dimension."
"The measures adopted within the European Union to alleviate the effects of rising prices should conform to a coordinated approach and be consistent with our multilateral commitments."
"We must achieve more transparency and balance in the setting of prices, eliminating speculative behaviour, preventing the abuses by large operators and preventing public actions that create distortion."
"We must introduce more rationality and efficiency into the global system, preventing energy wastage that we all pay for — the United States use 50% more energy per dollar of GDP than the European Union."
"We must reduce the disparity of environmental regulations, demonstrated in the United States by the recent hurricanes, urging companies to hold bigger stocks and promoting new investments."
"We must move towards a new energy model by means of innovation in transport, the development of technologies for decarbonisation and diversification and the development of renewable resources, and also by means of stable and lasting international cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I join with those who have thanked and praised Commissioner Piebalgs for his active and coherent strategy."
"I should now like to discuss the subject of renewable energy: not because I believe that it is the only solution to the problem but because, as shadow rapporteur on behalf of my group, I bear particular responsibility for this issue."
"It is true that renewable energy forms part of the response to the high oil prices; but, in my view, another important factor is that Europe and the Member States have not always set the right priorities with regard to renewable energy."
"We have a directive on electricity, and are active in that field, albeit rather less active in the field of biofuels."
"Yet we do not have a coherent European strategy for promoting renewable energy in the field of heating and cooling, even though dependence on oil and gas is strongest here."
"We also know the reason for this: namely because many advocates of renewable energy see it only as standing in opposition to nuclear power."
"I wonder, however, whether it is really a matter of supreme importance to withdraw from nuclear power."
"Is it not much more important to reduce dependence on oil and gas and bring the consequences of global climate change under control as far as possible?"
"Some might say that it is important to do one thing and imperative to do another; but that is not so easy with only limited means at our disposal."
"Germany, for example, has an Act on renewable energy, under which EUR 0.5 per kilowatt-hour is invested in photovoltaic technology."
"Cumulatively, EUR 3 billion will have been raised in this field in the coming years; of course, this money cannot be found elsewhere."
"We must remind ourselves that, for every euro invested in heating and cooling, for example in heating based on biomass, heat pumps or solar thermal energy, 45 times as much carbon dioxide and 45 times as much fossil fuel is saved."
"That is why it is time for some new priorities."
"Mr President, although the price of crude oil has tripled on the world market within the past three years, the insatiable hunger of mankind for energy does not seem to have abated."
"Moreover, the economic impact of natural disasters this year seems to sound warning bells for our petrol-based society."
"The majority of Member States rely on energy sources of remote areas and faraway countries, resulting in a dependency on less democratic states."
"If we do not act early enough, we will have to fall back on even more polluting fuel types when we run out of pure oil and gas, resulting in even more serious environmental damage."
"Therefore I strongly welcome the five-point plan of the Commission, especially its chapters on energy efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources."
"We must reduce oil consumption in energy production and especially in transport, by all means."
"The relevant directive must be followed more strictly in order to facilitate the promotion of biofuels."
"Service providers as well as consumers must be encouraged by preferential tax and administrative measures."
"It is extremely important to support non-oil based energy production research to a larger extent in Europe, both at community and Member State level."
"Nanotechnology in the solar energy sector, biotechnology in the biofuel sector, MUX in the nuclear energy sector or ITER in the area of thermonuclear energy production must all be supported, as they are crucial both for the environment and economy, and such support is indispensable if we want to stop the alarm bells ringing."
"It is good news that major oil consumer and environment polluting countries like the USA, China, India, Australia, Japan, and South-Korea signed an agreement in June this year in Laos as a ‘counter-Kyoto agreement’ to develop and promote cleaner energy types and technologies, since just like the problem itself, the solution must also be global."
"Mr President, Commissioner, expensive oil is, of course, the best incentive for both the authorities, industry and consumers to look for alternatives, and it goes without saying that we unreservedly endorse the initiatives you have developed in this area over the past few weeks."
"This is all good and well in the longer term, but in the short term, as has already been pointed out this afternoon, countless families, single people, both the old and young, are at risk of being left in the cold, quite literally, in the next few months, because they can simply no longer pay their heating bills."
"I fear that the Commission, with its consistent, yet somewhat harsh stance, has too little consideration for this."
"Meanwhile, various national governments have taken all kinds of new and diverse measures."
"The Belgian Government, for example, intends to reimburse some of the heating oil in order to relieve the pressure, but such measures do not, of course, solve the heating problems of the very many people here and now, and that is why I appeal to you to at last do something in the short term."
"A temporary reduction in VAT on fuel oil may not be such a bad idea."
"I know, Commissioner, that it is not one that you favour, but this is a social measure, after all."
"In the longer term, you may want to put a kind of bandwidth in place."
"With this, I mean not only a minimum, but also a maximum rate, in other words a lower limit and an upper limit within which the Member States should move."
"In that way, we can do something about the huge and ridiculous price differences between the Member States."
"Fuel oil, gas and electricity are all basic necessities for heating houses and are definitely not luxury goods."
"They are vital and, as you know better than I do, much of the price goes on VAT and excise to boost the national coffers."
"There is therefore definitely room to take structural measures, certainly in the short term."
"On a final note, Commissioner, whilst you must obviously protect the EU’s interests in the longer term, you could make a very kind gesture towards all those vulnerable families who are at risk of getting into difficulty in the coming weeks."
"Mr President, I wish to make a few remarks that some might find heretical."
"In my opinion, the European Union should encourage international political debate that would open the way for investment in developing countries."
"The benefits of this are obvious: major European companies would contribute financial resources to developing countries, while Europe would benefit from the cheaper oil from those countries and help to increase living standards there."
"From an economic point of view, we should let the market work without any regulation, any limitation or any further burdens."
"We should stop dreaming of cure-all renewable energy sources and remain realistic."
"We should not make any attempts to artificially influence oil prices."
"The only possible solution is to let the market work."
"The market forces stemming from a supply and demand approach will themselves re-establish the balance between high consumption devices and the natural and consumer-friendly development of brand new products."
"We must not step up our efforts to achieve tax harmonisation at a supranational level and we must not promote tax incentives that would result in lower rates of taxation for individual segments of the energy or oil industry."
". Mr President, I should like to thank the European Parliament for its strong interest in and activity on sustainable energy issues, where we should address all the questions – security of supply, competitiveness and environmental challenges – at the same time."
"I expect that in future we will have more debates on this subject."
"I should also like to thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and its chairman, Mr Chichester, for the possibility to discuss in detail today some of the issues raised in plenary with the committee members."
"That is why I shall not deal with each suggestion. I will concentrate my remarks on some particular points."
"With regard to legislative proposals, I assume that we have a good chance of finding an efficient compromise for energy end-use efficiency and an energy services directive."
"In the current situation the need for such a directive is even stronger."
"In November the Commission will approve a biomass action plan."
"The next step could be a legislative proposal for using biomass in heating and cooling."
"These are short-term measures that could be adopted."
"At the same time I can agree with the statement that there can be no miracle solution."
"It really means changing mindsets and asks for a systematic approach, not only from the Commission but also from the Council."
"I expect that during the Council meetings the energy situation will be discussed in more detail."
"The Council has already discussed fisheries."
"Other Councils also look at issues that relate to the new situation of supply and energy."
"In all the cases the answer from Europe depends very much on investment in research and development."
"That is the right way to proceed."
"The financial limits of the Seventh Framework Programme will, to a large extent, determine how fast our response will be."
"I hope that by the time of the adoption of the Seventh Framework Programme there will be the financial means for critical needs in some particular areas to address the issues we have debated today."
"I salute the motion for a resolution that you will adopt tomorrow."
"It is a very strong, ambitious and realistic resolution."
"The Commission will continue the activities on the five areas, but not only on these."
"A systematic approach, patience and consistency will be needed to achieve the results that European citizens expect of us."
"– I have received six motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure on oil(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 29 September 2005 at 12 noon."
"– The recent developments in oil prices has brought the problem of high oil prices to the top of the agenda, in light of the severe problems that this rise has caused in terms of economic growth and employment, and this at a time when the EU economy is virtually grinding to a halt."
"As Professor Michael T. Klare said recently, the era of easy oil is over."
"This twilight for the oil era is increasingly being seen in the politicisation of oil policy and by the repeated use of military power to gain control of available supplies."
"There is no shortage of examples and the war in Iraq is one of the most visible."
"We feel it is crucial that the issue of assessing resources and the drive towards prospecting for and developing hydrocarbons at both European and world level be the subject of far-reaching debate."
"One positive step would be to arrange a conference under the auspices of the UN, so as to ensure a worldwide approach to reducing oil consumption."
"We must prepare for the future by investing in research to find ways of reducing oil consumption in terms of GDP. Furthermore, we must invest in alternative energy sources and in using energy more efficiently, which is one of the most serious structural problems facing a number of countries, including Portugal."
"The next financial perspective must accord this issue the importance it deserves, and earmark funds for renewable energy."
"– The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the reform of the United Nations and the Millennium Development Goals."
". Mr President, two weeks ago at the 2005 World Summit, our Heads of State and Government met to decide how the international community, through the United Nations, should tackle the world's most pressing problems: the interrelated challenges of development, security and human rights."
"The decisions they took after two years of debate and consultation, now enshrined in the so-called outcome document, set the United Nations agenda for the years ahead."
"The challenges to the world's security and prosperity have been starkly and comprehensively set out by the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, head of the United Nations Millennium Project, and by Kofi Annan himself in his report."
"All concluded that until we took urgent action to address poverty, disease, environmental degradation and social injustice, we would not be able to prevent or resolve conflict."
"We would not be able to build peace, and without peace and security, development cannot take hold."
"Neither is possible without respect for human rights."
"These, as all the Members of this Parliament will know, are not new concepts."
"Indeed the United Nations was created 60 years ago to build peace and security throughout the world."
"But the world is very different 60 years on."
"Through technology and communication, countries are more closely bound together than ever before."
"That means too that the impact of conflicts and disasters is increasingly global in its reach."
"We all, therefore, have an overriding interest in working together to secure peace and build prosperity."
"Some, I know, were disappointed and frustrated by the results of the World Summit."
"Many felt that the commitments made did not go far enough."
"Reaching a consensus amongst 191 nations was never going to be easy."
"We know that only too well from our own experience with 25."
"So we should take heart from the fact that the far-reaching commitments made by G8 leaders in July to increase aid, to reduce debt and to expand trade have essentially been safeguarded at the United Nations summit."
"As Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General said, and I quote directly, 'taken as a whole, the [UN summit] document is still a remarkable expression of world unity on a wide range of issues'."
"Our task now is to ensure that the agreements are implemented."
"As my Prime Minister, Tony Blair, said in New York, if we start implementing with urgency the agreements on doubling aid, on opening up trade and establishing fair-trade rules, on debt relief, on HIV/Aids and malaria and on conflict prevention and stopping genocide, we would have more democracy, less oppression, more freedom, less terrorism, more growth, less poverty."
"I am proud that the European Union was at the forefront of efforts to reach consensus on all of the issues under debate."
"We had many priorities for the summit across the four so-called clusters of development, peace and collective security, human rights and the rule of law, and strengthening the United Nations."
"I believe that the conclusions reached at the summit set us out on the right path towards improvements in all of these areas, as long as the momentum is sustained and as long as we act now."
"The interest and commitment shown by Members of this Parliament towards improvements in these areas is truly admirable and was demonstrated in the expertise of the European Parliament delegation who attended the summit, led by co-Chairmen Nirj Deva and Michel Rocard."
"The summit secured firm and unambiguous commitments from both donor and developing countries on what is needed to reach the Millennium Development Goals."
"It strengthened the partnership between developed and developing countries set out at Monterey and consolidated all the achievements of this year so far."
"It broadened the consensus around the commitments established back in July at the Gleneagles summit to 191 countries, in particular the need to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Goals in Africa and to make international progress once again on climate change."
"It also agreed, as set out clearly in the outcome document, that development must be sustainable and take account of its impact on the global environment."
"Under the UK's Presidency, the European Council has continued to press for more international action to increase development aid in the fight against poverty and deprivation."
"We, the European Union, are already easily the world's largest aid donor: 80% of the extra USD 5 billion of aid pledged at the G8 summit in Gleneagles will come from Europe."
"We have also made a historic commitment to double aid to Africa by 2010."
"We have spearheaded the important agreements reached this year to reduce debt and launch global immunisation programmes against illnesses and diseases in the poorest countries."
"There has of course been criticism that not enough progress was made on trade, back at that summit in July."
"But it will ultimately be through the Doha Development Round that the international community can and must deliver real gains for poor countries by abolishing export subsidies and reducing all barriers to trade, including trade-distorting domestic support."
"We will work as hard as we can to ensure that political leaders focus on getting results at the WTO ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in December and indeed focus on these issues before the December Hong Kong ministerial meeting."
"As my Prime Minister has said, if we end up with a failure in December, that will echo right round the world."
"To make progress on development we need peace and security."
"As Kofi Annan set out in his document, : 'We will not enjoy development without security, we will not enjoy security without development, and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights.'"
"The summit agreed to establish a new peace-building commission, which will bring together United Nations member states, UN agencies and the international financial institutions to close a critical gap in the UN's ability to help countries emerging from conflict to make that vital transition to long-term stability and avoid relapsing into war."
"You know, as Members of this Parliament, that the European Union is committed to meeting the summit deadline of establishing the commission by the end of this year."
"More could have been said in the summit document regarding terrorism."
"The strong condemnation of terrorism 'in all its forms and manifestations' was certainly a welcome political statement."
"But we must now work on fulfilling our pledge to conclude the comprehensive convention on terrorism by September 2006."
"That will mean agreeing on a legal definition of terrorist acts, something that all of our governments have a real interest in securing."
"Despite the summit's failure to reach agreement on measures for non-proliferation and disarmament, I can assure Parliament that we will continue to work to move forward the agenda on these important issues."
"Ensuring respect for human rights lies at the very heart of the United Nations mission."
"We are fully supportive, therefore, of the creation of a new human rights council to replace the maligned Commission on Human Rights."
"We must urgently agree on its size, its mandate and composition so that it can begin its work and ensure that human rights are once again at the core of all UN activity."
"Perhaps the decision of greatest significance to emerge from that summit was the agreement on 'the responsibility to protect' – a political commitment that the international community has a duty to act when states cannot or will not protect their populations from the worst atrocities: genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"It is an important recognition that in today's world we cannot fail to act when vulnerable populations face these terrible atrocities."
"We must also work to strengthen the United Nations Secretariat, to make it a more effective and efficient body."
"We should begin by encouraging Kofi Annan to use the executive powers he already holds to effect change from within the organisation."
"But we, as member states, also have a key responsibility to ensure that the United Nations is structured and equipped to meet today's and tomorrow's challenges."
"The European Council welcomed the commitments to reform the main UN bodies, including the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Security Council."
"If the UN is to be effective it has to work collectively with all of its members."
"That means winning their support."
"UN organisations must therefore be representative, open and efficient."
"We will continue to work on improving the effectiveness of the General Assembly and Ecosoc in particular."
"We particularly welcome the mandate given to the Secretary-General to consider longer-term reform of the UN's development, humanitarian assistance and environment organisations so that their work is better managed and better coordinated."
"To be effective the United Nations must have the resources that it needs, but it cannot afford to waste funds on inefficiency and duplication of effort."
"The European Union fully supports the long-standing principle of budgetary discipline."
"We are therefore seeking to adopt a budget for the next financial year that will enable the Secretary-General and the United Nations to deliver what its members ask and expect, including under the new mandates agreed at the summit in New York."
"The key to the success of that 2005 Millennium Review Summit and the UN's reform programme in general is, of course, implementation."
"Some of the proposals will be explored in the Committee of the General Assembly, in session from now until the end of this year."
"Others will be taken forward independently."
"The European Union will again be at the forefront of this process."
"We, as United Nations member states, are responsible now for turning words into action."
", . Mr President, I was proud to be at the Millennium Summit and at the ministerial week that followed."
"It was the biggest gathering of world leaders ever seen and I hope it will usher in a new era of international cooperation."
"Despite all the criticism – which I myself also made – we must clearly state that the United Nations lies at the bedrock of modern world order."
"The outcome – as my colleague has mentioned already – has been mixed, but the glass is half full and not half empty."
"The European Union was very ambitious and took the lead, together with President Jean Ping of the United Nations General Assembly."
"In the end, we could not achieve everything we wanted."
"That is normal at multilateral gatherings."
"One has high ambitions but in the end one has to compromise."
"Having said that, there are a number of very important achievements and other matters on which we were disappointed."
"What were the achievements?"
"For the Commission it was remarkable to have the Millennium Development Goals enshrined in the Millennium Declaration."
"That was thanks to my colleague Mr Michel."
"I am happy to say that the European Union has set the example with 0.56% up to 2010 and 0.7% up to 2015."
"That showed that other colleagues, especially from the developing countries, were very happy about it."
"This reaffirmation of acknowledgement of the Millennium Development Goals as a galvanizing framework for development efforts has been achieved for the first time at an intergovernmental level."
"The second great achievement was the endorsement of the principle of responsibility to protect populations from atrocities."
"This was a major success because it redefines the concept of sovereignty as a positive concept, putting human beings at the core of security concerns."
"That should enhance the credibility of the international community, and the United Nations means to act in the face of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity."
"I come from a country close to the Balkans and remember the Kosovo intervention."
"That intervention has in a way triggered this new development of international law and, for the first time, this enshrining of the development goals."
"The third achievement was the Peace-building Commission, which is an important concrete result that should make the international community’s response to the needs of countries dealing with the aftermath of conflicts more effective and coordinated."
"The Commission has been working with all the same factors, from humanitarian efforts to reconstruction efforts and institution building, to trade and all questions surrounding democracy and human rights; from military peacekeeping missions to election observation missions."
"All that will now be coordinated in the Peace-building Commission and we therefore feel that the Commission there has to have its place at the table."
"There are other matters on which I personally was disappointed."
"The first of these relates to the Human Rights Council."
"It was more of a name change than a real achievement, but at least the principle has been accepted and we hope that together we can work to make the new human rights architecture a better, more crucial one, together with the new President of the General Assembly, Jan Eliasson."
"It is important to have a strong, credible, standing institution comprising Member States that have a human rights credit."
"On the other hand, there were some positive steps on human rights, such as the doubling of the budget for the Human Rights Special High Representative, which opens up the possibility of direct action in the field."
"I also note with encouragement that the summit outcome contains a resolution to 'strengthen the United Nations human rights machinery with the aim of ensuring effective enjoyment by all of human rights'."
"Another negative point was the whole question of disarmament."
"It was described by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan as nothing less than a disgrace."
"We clearly have to go on working on that very important item."
"There are two further questions, one of which is the environment."
"Environmental sustainability is instrumental in our fight against poverty, for stabilisation and for greater security."
"Especially now, with the tsunami, Katrina and Rita, and floods in the European Union, a real United Nations environmental organisation would have been the right response by the international community."
"Finally, a word on the United Nations management reforms."
"I think it is very important that the Secretary-General not only has accountability and responsibility, but also gets the authority to lead this management reform and be able to implement it."
". Mr President, I agree with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that the results of the New York Summit are diverse and heterogeneous, containing both positive and negative results."
"In any event, I feel somewhat relieved at the final document of the Summit because I well remember that, two years ago, the international community was very divided and the United Nations was in a situation of deadlock."
"Furthermore, just hours before the Summit opened, it seemed that it would be difficult to achieve a final document which contained anything more than mere general points."
"Fortunately, it has been possible to reach an agreement on a document that contains some substantial achievements, though it also unquestionably contains shortcomings and failures."
"I would like to stress — as the Commissioner has done — that, for example, the Summit has achieved a significant reaffirmation of the Millennium Development Objectives."
"With regard to security, my diagnosis is the same: the lack of any result with regard to non-proliferation and disarmament is regrettable."
"In the field of combating terrorism — such an important issue — I believe that there has been very little progress."
"We have not even been able to produce a minimal definition of the act of terrorism with which the international community could agree."
"The positive aspect, however – as has already been mentioned – is the creation of the Peace Consolidation Committee."
"With regard to the reform of the United Nations, I do not believe that anybody is surprised about the failure of the reform of the Security Council."
"In the international community there are profound and apparently insurmountable differences in this regard."
"We in the European Union lack a common position."
"The only thing I want to stress here is that the majority of this Parliament, in its Resolution of June of this year, expressed its support for a European Union seat."
"In another great area – human rights – I am pleased — as the representative of the Council and the Commissioner have pointed out — about the recognition of the international community’s right and duty to provide protection in the event of genocide."
"But in this same field of human rights, regrettably, the only decision adopted has been to create the Human Rights Council, without any further detail."
"I therefore very much fear that the negotiation on defining the Council’s mandate, its members and the method of election is being seriously delayed."
"In short, I believe that there remains much to be done, but the truth is that, following the Summit — and I am drawing to a close, Mr President — there is now a basis on which to continue building."
"The 60th anniversary of the creation of the United Nations offered a good opportunity to bring the international community back together and bring it into line with the challenges of the new century."
"I hope that the steps taken may be translated into progress during this very decisive year."
". Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the President-in-Office – who, I know full well, is a very committed internationalist himself – to this debate."
"I thank the Commissioner for the support she gave us in the delegation that attended the summit in New York."
"As you have all mentioned, NGOs and others have been somewhat critical of the Outcome Document of the summit."
"However, I would argue, as you have done, for a more measured approach in the assessment that we make and would agree that we should describe it as a glass half-full."
"I also believe that exaggerated accusations of failure will not help to create the right incentives for policy makers to take risks and take action."
"In the Outcome Document there are strong commitments on how we should meet the MDGs by 2015."
"However, one of the things I regret is that global target 8 is not strong enough to ensure that countries like New Zealand, Australia, Canada or Italy are not let off the hook and to keep pressure on them to do the same as the European Union has done."
"Promises of 0.7% are simply not enough and, therefore, we need to see action from these countries and others."
"I also welcome – as I am sure the President-in-Office does – the strong reference in the document to the need for innovative sources of finance to be sought in order to meet the MDGs."
"I also believe that the endorsement given by George Bush to the MDGs represents significant progress – perhaps the best progress of the week."
"Perhaps self-interest is pushing the United States along that multilateral road that many of us believe it is not prepared to take."
"I am also keen to acknowledge that in the Outcome Document they make a very clear link between security, development and conflict resolution in the measures that they take."
"It also clearly identifies the responsibilities of both developed and developing countries."
"The EU development policy statement is now the appropriate vehicle for us to move this forward and to show that we firmly believe in the need to rebuild, in Europe and elsewhere, that strong sense of unity, purpose and action."
"The document is also strong on governance and the rule of law, which are very important aspects of our work with developing countries."
"You have mentioned the Peace-building Commission – which is very important – and peace-making, peace-keeping and peace-building."
"I regret that the Human Rights Council is now going into the General Assembly, where it will be subject to wrangling and horse-trading."
"Therefore, again, the European Union has a role to play in pushing this forward in a positive way."
"Most of all, I welcome the fact that we now have collective responsibility to protect civilians against genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and all crimes against humanity."
"Now we look forward to the proof that in the future the UN will be able to avoid those failures that we so tragically saw in Bosnia and Rwanda."
"On reform issues, we regret that the Secretary-General will continue to be micro-managed by the member states of the United Nations."
"The biggest disappointment is the failure to address the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"That means that we now have a yawning gap in our international arrangements and the EU again must apply pressure to move this forward."
"Finally, I wish to refer to the amendment tabled by the PSE Group on sexual and reproductive health rights."
"This is an important position for us to take if we are to meet the Millennium Development Goals."
"It underpins all those goals, particularly on HIV/AIDS and maternal and child mortality."
"I trust that this Parliament will reinstate this in the text; that we will commit ourselves, as we did in the vote on my report on the Millennium Development Goals, to this important aspect."
"This Parliament should then subsequently support the international legitimacy of the UN."
"In 1945 the stakes were high for the policy makers; the stakes are high now, but the reasons for moving forward are just as great as they were then."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we Europeans agree that the world needs the United Nations; and moreover, that it needs the United Nations to be strong."
"Rarely in its sixty-year history has the UN been so much the focus of public attention; rarely were reforms as important or necessary as this year."
"The ultimate achievements of the Outcome Document are unsatisfactory."
"Nevertheless, my group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, is of the opinion that the progress made is to be acknowledged, whilst things we failed to achieve are to be discussed even more intensively than before."
"The glass is half full."
"The EU now has the task of helping to fill it to the brim."
"Parliament, in particular, must see the result of the Summit as an opportunity."
"We view Parliament as a co-architect of the continuing reform process."
"As Members of the European Parliament, we hold the key to securing and strengthening acceptance of the UN by the people, driving democratisation of the organisation forward successfully, and in particular ensuring that millions of people have access to food, clean water and better health services."
"The Millennium Development Goals must be implemented."
"Progress on this by Member States is unsatisfactory."
"The Outcome Document of the Summit does not lay down a precise timetable to hold the Member States to their commitments."
"This is disappointing."
"On the other hand, as Mrs Kinnock mentioned, there is the endorsement by the USA of the Millennium Development Goals, unexpected in its clarity, which is a very positive development on which we must build."
"I think that we should take our friends in the USA at their word."
"My group warmly welcomes the creation of a Peacebuilding Commission."
"This is a decision that will increase the profile of the UN in crisis regions."
"It must be the task of the EU to provide valuable support for the setting-up and operation of this Commission."
"The EU is one of the world’s leading peace-builders: as a donor, a helper and a political force."
"Incidentally, this must be made a great deal clearer than it has been within the UN system."
"We are pleased that we and the Commissioner are so unanimous on this."
"An initial step, on which I should also like an opinion from the Commission and the Council, would be to combine the representatives of Council and Commission in New York and at the other UN sites."
"The ALDE Group regards the promotion of democracy as another important task."
"The establishment of a Democracy Fund is an important step in the right direction, and further measures could include the establishment of a ‘caucus of democracies’ within the General Assembly."
"A parliamentary assembly should also be considered."
"One thing is clear, and that is that the reform of the UN is not complete and must be continued consistently."
"This applies in particular to the Security Council."
"Kofi Annan’s proposals are well-known."
"It is now up to the General Assembly to decide on one by the end of the year."
"In addition, we in Parliament maintain the vision of a permanent seat for the European Union as soon as the political, legal and constitutional conditions for this are met."
"This is emphasised once more in our resolution, which is to be put to the vote tomorrow."
"We cannot afford to let the UN be a second-tier player; it must take centre stage."
"For only the UN has the potential to overcome the challenges of our time through a multilateral approach and on a global scale."
"Parliament must support it on this path, as we need a strong United Nations."
"Incidentally, I believe that we should be conducting this debate in Brussels and not in Strasbourg."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, it must be said without equivocation that the United Nations has just missed a historic opportunity for systematic reform."
"The result is disappointing, and the good groundwork by Kofi Annan has not been transformed into real success."
"The reform has failed in four key areas."
"There will not be any reform of the Security Council that produces genuine regional representation."
"There is no plan for disarmament or non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Plans to create a UN Environment Organisation were unsuccessful."
"I should like to add that, particularly in the face of the challenges of international climate policy, that is a very serious omission."
"We do not have any real instrument for United Nations policy in this field."
"Attempts to further develop the Economic and Social Council – particularly in the face of the great challenges that we face with regard to development policy – were also unsuccessful."
"The phrase ‘the end of one reform is the start of the next’ is therefore true today."
"Nevertheless, there has of course been some progress that we can use as a starting point."
"The establishment of a UN Human Rights Council is a good thing, even if its composition is not yet clear."
"The doubling of the resources of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is also good."
"Another positive development is that there will be a Peacebuilding Commission."
"It is good that the Millennium Development Goals have been reaffirmed and that various action programmes and solidarity funds are being set up."
"What emerges from this is a specific challenge for the European Union, and so I wish to call on the Council and the Commission to present a precise action plan for the specific financial and organisational contribution of the European Union to the implementation of these measures."
"The aim now, in the wake of the Summit, is to back up the rhetoric of the United Nations with specific, material support."
". – I, too, should like to say that the glass is half full, but we all know that this is not true."
"The summit was a failure."
"Whilst the summit did reaffirm the modest Millennium Goals, it was prevented from turning words into action."
"Somebody stopped the donating countries from making commitments in terms of financial support based on clear targets."
"What we are actually left with is a glass full of words and a hand full of nothing."
"The Assembly also trotted out well-intentioned words against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but a number of people placed barriers in the way of a disarmament strategy."
"Without such a strategy, the nuclear club will inevitably continue to proliferate."
"The Assembly also sought to reform the United Nations, but somebody pulled out all the stops to ensure that everything remains as it is."
"That somebody has a name: John Bolton, the official voice of the empire in the United Nations."
"Commissioner, you mentioned ‘Katrina’."
"The New Orleans tragedy and the New York failure share a common thread – the North American administration."
"In New Orleans the rule was simple – if you had a car you got out and if you did not, then tough."
"In the emperor’s ideal world this is the way it works."
"Washington does not wish to know about the poor, because it does not even deal with its own."
"As far as the White House is concerned, the poor are quite simply a waste of time and money."
"Mr President, my group will be voting for this resolution, because, however unambitious it may be, it does represent a step in the right direction, and because we need a strong United Nations and will do everything in our power to make the United Nations strong."
"Let us be clear, however. We will only have a credible United Nations when Europe and the rest of the world sends Washington the right signals."
"Harsh words were spoken today about Turkey."
"I should like to see the same stringent standards applied to Washington."
"Mr President, the June List is a friend of the UN and believes that the UN can be given ample ability to contribute constructive solutions to international conflicts."
"We do not, however, believe that the EU and its Parliament should dictate how the UN should work and what its goals should be."
"The debate on the UN’s future should be conducted between the UN’s member states and in international contexts broader than the European one."
"We are critical of the proposal that the EU be represented by a single seat on the UN Security Council."
"Nor do we support Parliament’s desire to set up common EU delegations at the various headquarters of the UN."
"The EU Member States have different views on the issues dealt with by the UN and its Security Council."
"Sweden, for example, has played an important role in the UN as a bridge builder between poor and rich countries, as a mediator and as a promoter of disarmament."
"What this shows is that small countries too have an important role to play in the UN and in international politics."
"We fear that the small countries’ voices would not be heard if the EU were to speak with one voice in UN contexts."
"Which of the EU’s 25 voices would then be heard from this single seat?"
"If it were the case that the EU could speak with a single voice in UN contexts, why then are the United Kingdom and France defending their present permanent seats on the Security Council?"
"Why is Germany trying to obtain a seat on the Security Council?"
"The truth is that the EU Member States have no uniform view on international political issues."
"This has become evident on quite a number of occasions, especially in connection with the United States’s intervention in Iraq."
"Let us affirm our many-faceted continent and let us work to ensure that all voices are heard in the debate."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following lively debates, in May the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the reform of the UN."
"As part of that resolution, Parliament called on the UN to keep its promises, to provide assistance to developing countries, to reach agreement on a common definition of terrorism, to adopt an action plan for the prevention of genocide and also to reform the Security Council, which still continues to reflect the post-war world order."
"Of these tasks, none has been achieved."
"On the contrary, the few agreements that have been reached are hedged about with compromises and will in all likelihood not be properly effective."
"On the issue of UN reform there are currently more failures than achievements."
"This outcome gives rise to the question of whether the European Union is a strong global player."
"The answer is obvious."
"The European Union has not worked effectively enough."
"I would therefore like to call on the European Commission to evaluate the results of UN reform from the European Union perspective, and also to reflect on how to coordinate future activities with other countries, so that the decisions we take do not remain merely resolutions."
"In such circumstances it is important to assess whether the UN is capable of reforming itself at all, or whether perhaps a new organisation of a similar type is needed."
"That is further in the future, however."
"Right now it is important to draw up a strategy on how to achieve the goals that have already been set, so that the UN may work effectively to achieve security and prosperity in the modern world."
"Everybody agrees about the need to reform the United Nations."
"The only problem is the shape that this reform should take."
"We agree that the UN system is much too complex and should be streamlined."
"I believe, however, that the biggest problem is not the reform of UN bodies, but the inability of UN members to reach political agreement, due to fundamentally opposing views concerning the work of the UN as such."
"Some members would like to see a strong UN, while others oppose such aims; it is precisely this that prevents agreement."
"I am, however, more concerned about the UN commitment to reaching the so-called Millennium Development Goals, that is, to reduce poverty by half, to fight hunger, malaria and other diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and to ensure respect for human rights, especially the rights of women."
"Although the UN has pledged to fulfil these objectives by 2015, poverty has still not been reduced, and in fact it is increasing."
"It is estimated that if we continued working at the current pace, it would take one hundred years to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"In September I was the only member of an EU institution taking part in a women’s rights conference in China."
"It was the so-called Beijing +10 Conference."
"The Conference was held for the first time in 1975 and has been repeated every ten years since then."
"It is interesting that, since 1995, no country in the world has been able to organise a fifth conference on women’s issues."
"I find myself wondering whether the European Union is interested in information on how the declarations that we have co-signed are implemented, and how assistance provided to some countries by the European Union, especially in the form of financial help, is used."
"If we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, financial assistance must be more than doubled."
"The European Union, as an important donor, must monitor the way in which this assistance is used. It must ensure that this assistance is not abused by being allocated for other purposes, and that the recipient country respects human rights."
"If there is no respect for human rights, financial assistance should be withdrawn."
"If, however, we fail to participate in conferences and do not learn about the kind of problems that arise during implementation, our assistance, intended to purchase medications and to build schools, may instead be used to purchase weapons or to recruit child soldiers."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the President-in-Office and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for the excellent work they have already done at the UN."
"I was privileged to co-chair the delegation to the UN with my distinguished colleague, Michel Rocard, the former Prime Minister of France."
"We need a United Nations which reflects the shared values of ordinary people and which delivers them."
"Today we live in a global market full of images."
"The tsunami in Indonesia, the floods in New Orleans and terrorism in London become local events: local in my village, in my reality, in my home and among my friends."
"This is 'unity through diversity', not 'one-size fits all'."
"How can the UN exist in this brave new world and still be relevant?"
"The UN has no legislative powers, nor is it a world government."
"It is merely an organisation that delivers."
"The best thing to have happened to the United Nations, in hindsight, is the United States suddenly having become more serious about its delivery capability."
"Business as usual is therefore no longer an option and Messrs Ping and Annan have done excellent work in starting the process of reform."
"Excellent work is already being done by the UN's specialised agencies such as the WHO, UNDP, the World Food Programme, the IMO and the ICO, but even here there is scope for an in-depth review to ensure best value for money and the highest quality of management."
"Those organisations may be delivering, but the UN process itself in New York is not."
"That must change."
"We should limit the process in New York and instead focus on UN agencies as outputs."
"We need to draw upon best-practice in government and large corporations."
"A long-range planning group should be established to predict crisis situations well in advance."
"Poverty, disease, conflict and despair are often the result of poor national governance."
"We should help to increase capacity and give aid to those who can use it wisely."
"I am pleased to announce that the European Parliament, through the Committee on Development and Cooperation has already proposed that an amount of around EUR 2 million be allocated under the budget for quick-win impacts and also, following a meeting with the Commissioner in New York, for the Peace Building Commission."
"An effective system of international governance and justice is one that brings to justice those who have committed crimes against humanity."
"We also have a right to protect."
"UN peacekeepers must be better trained, and under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, they could have right of enforcement powers for conflict resolution."
"Mr President, I wish to say that this has been a very important and excellent debate."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, the United Nations Summit was not a failure, but I do agree with many of my fellow Members that it was disappointing."
"Nevertheless, thanks to the commitment of Europe and of many developing countries, tangible results did emerge."
"It is to be hoped that the General Assembly produces yet more progress in the coming months."
"The greatest disappointment, as far as I am concerned, is the absence of a commitment to global disarmament."
"Mankind spends EUR 1 000 billion per annum on arms and EUR 60 billion on development aid."
"If someone from another planet were to look down on this earth, he would think that mankind wished to destroy itself and had no desire to survive."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council, therefore, what Europe is doing to ensure that an initiative is taken to make good this deficiency in the field of disarmament – particularly of weapons of mass destruction?"
"I also think it a shame that hardly any success was achieved in reforming the bodies of the UN."
"The role of the Secretary-General has hardly been strengthened at all."
"The General Assembly has been unable to reform itself, and the Security Council is a pure anachronism."
"In this regard, an astonishing fact is that the African Union apparently functions better than the European Union."
"The 53 African states had specific ideas on which countries from their continent should sit on the Security Council."
"Europe is divided on this and perhaps even contributed to the failure to expand the Security Council."
"Hence, I would also ask the Commission and the Council what Europe is doing to remedy this fault."
"My final point concerns the democratisation of the UN."
"Sixty years on, this cannot be a matter for governments alone."
"We need a parliamentary component."
"The Inter-Parliamentary Union is all very well, but it is not enough."
"A parliamentary assembly will be necessary sooner or later, because EU civil society is better placed than the citizens’ chambers in the UN, and this situation cannot continue."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my friend and colleague Mr Lambsdorff has already spoken on behalf of the group and poked fun at me, on behalf of the Liberal component of the group, by describing the glass as half full."
"It is up to me, perhaps because I belong to the Democrat component of the group, to try to reflect a little on the empty half of the glass."
"We have all experienced a contradiction in recent weeks: interest around the world has been growing as never before in the role of the United Nations and the role of Europe."
"It is a big question, but whenever we have a chance to respond to that growing expectation, we fail to achieve a result."
"The document we approved in the United Nations was not one with which to start reflecting on the UN: it was to implement a debate that was already two years old."
"We realise, however, that between August and September a number of difficult topics disappeared from the table; others were only confirmed in principle, and we stopped there; and yet others were put off until subsequent negotiations."
"That is how things stand."
"There has been no reform of the Security Council, no progress on the relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation, and no clear condemnation of terrorism, although there has been a vague definition of terrorism. A body like the Human Rights Council exists only in principle."
"Even what has been presented as a great step forward, that is, the new ‘right to protect’ rule, says, as one realises if one reads it carefully, that the Security Council will assess each situation on a case-by-case basis, which means that we are in the same position as before Rwanda."
"Nothing has changed."
"We have said that there is a principle, but on every occasion we have to establish whether it applies in that case."
"What does all that mean?"
"It means that, even though we have reiterated the Millennium Goals, we have missed an opportunity."
"The document is rather like our work in Europe: we are not in crisis, our bureaucracy works, and we produce documents."
"We make thousands of decisions, but they are often decisions that the people do not expect from us, and we are unable to make the decisions that they do expect from us."
"That is our problem."
"A 35-page document that removes the most difficult items is not a successful document: it is a document that drowns its difficulties in a sea of pages."
"Therefore, all that I want to say is that this Summit has, instead, shown the extent to which Europe today needs to count as a political unit, a single political unit, within which we have commercial weight because we have a single will."
"We have a role in the world; in situations where we are split into 25 parts we do not, or we have much less of a role than we think."
"We are in the middle of a pause for reflection after the referendum defeats."
"Let us not turn this pause for reflection into a Mexican siesta; let us wake up a little before then."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not beat about the bush: the Summit on the reform of the United Nations was, generally speaking, an enormous disappointment for those of us who believe in that institution and, above all, in its founding principles."
"The Summit ended — this is true and it has been said — with certain positive commitments, but certain key aspects were left out — as has also been said — such as the reform of the Security Council, for example."
"The proposals presented for discussion by the Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, were good and reasonable, but they were also urgent and they should have been supported, and I therefore regret – and this is the only way I can put it – that the European Union has given in to pressure from the United States, thereby spoiling what should have been an historic opportunity."
"Particularly worrying is the lack of commitments to improve and strengthen global governance in relation to ecological, social and economic issues, but also the withdrawal of the conclusions of the chapter relating to disarmament and non-proliferation."
"And neither is anything said on such an urgent and necessary issue as the adoption of an international arms treaty, the proliferation of arms being the main cause of many deaths in the world."
"For all of these reasons, I must call on the Council and the Commission from now on to have the courage and daring to defend these principles by means of concrete measures and, as Mr Schmidt has said, an action plan that clearly defines what the European Union’s position should be, so that we do not – I would insist – give in once again to pressure from the United States."
"– Mr President, we are now debating how full the glass is."
"I must be frank and say that the glass is almost empty; there is nothing to drink – and this should be a commonly accepted fact."
"This United Nations Summit was an all-round failure."
"What was planned was not achieved."
"A very good illustration of this is the change in this outcome resolution, when one compares its original appearance with the way it has ended up – only a thin paper now remains."
"I am pleased on one count, however: that it was not adopted."
"The reason is that it concerns the proposals of the High-Level Panel that presented a report to Kofi Annan."
"This Panel wanted to anchor a concept of pre-emptive war in the United Nations, and would have destroyed the basic idea of the United Nations in so doing."
"There is no longer any specific reference to the concept of pre-emptive war; only an allusion to it remains, in paragraph 92."
"I am very glad that this change was made."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner says that this was, in a way, triggered by the Kosovo war, but that is exactly where the problem lies. That war constituted a violation of international law, and that is exactly what we want to avoid."
"International law should not be violated."
"Mr President, the United Nations evolved from various initiatives to bring the countries of the world together to promote true peace through the recognition of the dignity and worth of the human person and the value of the community – local, national, and global – in protecting the person."
"In many ways over 60-plus years the UN has accomplished this vital mandate."
"However, in recent decades there has been increasing criticism of the way the UN does business, the way it spends its money and the type of results it is getting or not getting."
"The Millennium challenge is enormous and it will take a functional UN to meet it."
"Reform is nothing to be ashamed of."
"Even the tidiest house needs a spring-clean."
"Every organisation needs to step back and review its methods."
"I think the example of UNICEF is a good place to start in understanding the desperate and urgent need to reform the UN."
"Jim Grant led and largely created UNICEF, the UN response to children, until he died in 1995."
"UNICEF justifiably earned the respect of countries and agencies everywhere for its programmes of oral rehydration, breastfeeding promotion, and primary education."
"UNICEF was in touch with the real needs of real children."
"Over the ten years since Mr Grant's death, UNICEF seemed to become a vehicle not for promoting children, but a political agenda focused on women's rights, which was not the appropriate place: it was a children's agency."
"Ms Bellamy, who directed UNICEF after Mr Grant, was forced to resign last year."
"Although criticism was building over nine years of her tenure, the UN structures as they have evolved did not allow any internal investigation of UNICEF."
"Only from the outside did an accumulation of critics and a growing scandal about the neglect of children's programmes eventually force her resignation."
"Last year, amidst the final crescendo, publications such as were reporting that UNICEF's failure to develop a coherent strategy for child survival and its shortcomings were contributing to 10 million child deaths per year."
"For an organisation to tolerate this, such a publicly known problem, shows it needs reform."
"There is no disgrace in reform."
"No, there is only disgrace in resisting reform where it is needed."
"Success will come when we realise that the UN is an ideal that needs to be fostered and that we need an efficient organisation that can serve these ideals."
"Mr President, General de Gaulle used to refer to the United Nations as ."
"Today, now that the 60th anniversary of the UN seems to have ended up in a performance reminiscent of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, we can honestly ask ourselves whether the wise words by the former French Head of State do not hold true today."
"Indeed, it took weeks and weeks to discuss a 35-page document that ultimately – for let us call a spade a spade – is not much more than a vague declaration of intent."
"Sixty years on from its foundation, the UN’s weakness has yet again been clearly exposed."
"The UN’s human rights committee, so discredited by its past inclusion of such countries as Cuba, Zimbabwe and Sudan, is being replaced by a human rights council."
"About the composition of this new institution, or about measures to bar such countries from it, the text, however, has not one word to say."
"While all countries condemned terrorism, this committee failed to reach agreement on the definition of the term."
"Neither did it reach consensus about the principles of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and, last but not least, the so desperately needed reform of the Security Council is being postponed once again."
"Seen in that context, it is really mind-boggling that Japan, to name but one example, should fund 19% of the cost price of UN peace operations, yet has no say in the decision-making process – not quite a democratic way of going about things, one might say."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ambitious challenge of the Millennium Summit was human globalisation, human rights, peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity, and we can conclude that, fundamentally, what that Summit has achieved has been to restrain the attempts to dismantle the United Nations and to point, though with many shortcomings, to certain areas of progress."
"I would like, Mr President, to mention an important one of these: the initiative of the Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan, who has taken on board the proposal of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero, and of the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan."
"What we have seen this morning in this Chamber demonstrates the importance of that initiative on the alliance of civilisations."
"Mr President, I would like to end by saying that we must also bear in mind that the European Union is not currently a Member of the United Nations, but it is a key member of the WTO."
"That is a challenge that we must face with generosity and in a multilateral spirit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, so, what had to happen has indeed happened."
"There has been no real reform of the UN, and Europe will not have a seat on the Security Council, a point on which everyone is keeping quiet even though, it has to be said, it was the EU’s main hope at the summit."
"One of the consequences of this failure is that the European Union, which will not have a Foreign Minister any more than it has any kind of common foreign policy, will remain a kind of international forum with no external visibility."
"All of this was quite obvious, despite the balanced comments just made to us by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, who, in passing, given that she is speaking on French soil, could have spoken in French; in any event, she is not listening to me, as she is well able to do."
"If the European ‘machine’ had been a bit more realistic regarding its own importance, we could have spared ourselves these long debates into the vacuum on the so-called European seat, which will be consigned to the back of the wardrobe with the deep piles of our shattered illusions."
"However, we must reflect on this failure nonetheless, because it should put us on our guard, as the failure of the Constitution, or the European deconstitution, did on a larger scale, regarding the narrow limits within which our ambitions must be contained."
"The impossibility of reforming the UN, which was predictable, and which we did indeed predict in our previous speeches on the subject, was itself written into the conditions of international activity."
"The principle that governs and will always govern international life is the pre-eminence of sovereignties."
"While, within states, there can be legislation that applies to all and legitimate means of coercion that can make relations between people more peaceful, at international level there is no legitimate referee, nor will there ever be, whether it is an international organisation or a state that claims to have sole responsibility for peace among nations."
"That is because, faced with a referee State, in reality an imperial state, just as when faced with any supranational organisation, the other states will never lose sight of their own interests, their own personality and, I repeat, their sovereignty, as my colleague Mrs Goudin said."
"That does not necessarily mean that the world is a jungle: it simply means that peace is based solely on the balance between nations and groups of nations and that all international law can do is marginalise the natural games of states that, however devoted they claim to be to the cause of peace, are still heartless monsters and will never stop calculating their power."
"This should therefore be a lesson to us: the multilateral framework can achieve certain things where, and only where, by some miracle, the interests of the nations happen to coincide."
"I hope that realism will open our eyes and that we will finally be able to see the narrowness of the framework within which our actions are confined, by the very nature of things."
"Mr President, I would like to make just six comments."
"Firstly, I would like to condemn the actions of the United States administration, which torpedoed the United Nations in general and these New York meetings in particular."
"They torpedoed them by appointing Bolton as the United States’ representative in the United Nations and tabling 750 amendments to the draft final text, which the international community had spent a long time working on, negotiating and agreeing, in order to empty it of any content."
"It is absurd that, when the United States finally have to make a couple of concessions, there should be so many expressions of gratitude and congratulations just because they have not entirely completed their latest attempt to remake ‘Apocalypse Now’."
"Secondly, I acknowledge that the European Union’s role in the summit has been relatively commendable and positive."
"It has also been relatively effective, when its Member States have acted in a coordinated and agreed fashion."
"Thirdly, I would like to stress that the best example of this can be seen in what is undoubtedly the most worthwhile aspect of the New York Summit: with regard to the Millennium Development Objectives, we have not moved backwards, despite some people’s efforts to do so."
"The European Union acted firmly and at least ensured that the commitments and the timetable approved five years ago were maintained."
"Fourthly, it is regrettable that the essential reform of the United Nations failed, a point that is as illustrative as the previous one, but in a negative sense."
"In this respect, our Member States arrived with differing visions and the Union was incapable of expressing itself, either through its positions or by exerting any influence whatsoever, and is therefore partly responsible for this failure."
"Fifthly, we are pleased that the Summit has supported Kofi Annan’s ‘alliance of civilisations’ strategy, accepting a European initiative such as that proposed by the Prime Ministers of Spain and Turkey."
"And sixthly, we are delighted that Europe has contributed to keeping the United Nations afloat, saving it from the shipwreck that some people had been preparing for it."
"It is not, however, sufficient to keep the United Nations afloat, but it is essential to relaunch the organisation definitively."
"The European Union’s objectives must be geared towards that objective, but to that end, our Union will have to be rather more than simply afloat."
"I shall end with something that an African politician said to us: ‘This world does not inspire enthusiasm, in fact it often causes disgust, but it is terrifying to think what it would be if Europe were not operating as a force for rationality, balance, a degree of coherence and, at times, solidarity’."
"Mr President, Council, Commission, fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen. The UN summit made clear the need for cooperation in combating terrorism, climate change, international crime and weapons of mass destruction and in dealing with migration."
"It made it clear that more, rather than less, cooperation is required."
"The Peacebuilding Commission was given a lot of scope."
"This is something that the European Parliament now has the opportunity to follow up. Following the initiative taken by the Swedish Foreign Minister, involving 13 female foreign ministers and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, we now have the peacebuilding work on which to adopt a position."
"We must involve more women and, above all, have one woman for every man at all levels, with this equal representation enabling women and men to make better contributions."
"Why is this so important?"
"Well, because, in modern wars and conflicts, the great majority of the victims are innocent women and children."
"In the transition from conflict to a sustainable peace, all resources and civil solutions are needed."
"How do we now follow this up in the EU?"
"When the Millennium Goal was debated, it became obvious that the donor countries must be more generous."
"It was therefore with great delight that we learned at the weekend that debts were to be written off by 18 countries."
"I regret that it is only Sweden and another four countries that provide aid amounting to 0.7%."
"We must do better."
"In the year 2000, Sweden reached the level of 1%."
"Given how much we pour out here in the EU, we should easily be able to fill the glass."
"– I was a Member of Parliament’s delegation at the Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, organised by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in New York on 7, 8 and 9 September."
"In my address to the 145 delegations in attendance, I reaffirmed Parliament’s recent positions as regards the reform of the United Nations and the commitment towards the Millennium Development Goals."
"My message was given greater resonance by the fact that previously all European Parliament resolutions on issues such as this were disclosed to the national and regional political delegations."
"With specific regard to the reform of the United Nations, I told the delegates that Parliament stands four-square behind the positions adopted by the UN Secretary-General, such as his view that world security is intrinsically linked to economic and social development, respect for human rights and environmental protection."
"I also mentioned the need to press ahead with changes to the composition of the Security Council; I believe that the EU should eventually have a permanent seat, and that new seats should be created at the earliest opportunity enabling new countries and emerging regions to be represented."
"My last point on the United Nations General Assembly was that not only should there be reform of working methods but also that there should ultimately be a proper United Nations parliamentary assembly."
"My plan was to contribute to the debate with this brief overview, which will also act as the report on the mission that I am required to make to Parliament."
". Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to respond to this debate."
"I thank Members of Parliament for their insightful questions and challenging comments."
"I will endeavour to address as many of your points as possible in my closing remarks."
"At the 2005 Millennium Review Summit our heads of state and government and those of another 166 countries took up the challenge set by Kofi Annan of reforming the United Nations to make it more efficient, more effective and indeed more relevant to today's challenges."
"The summit outcome document, to characterise the discussion we have had this afternoon, should be seen not as a glass half empty, but instead understood for what I believe it to be: a clear mandate for further change."
"I believe that we all share the view that a stronger, more effective and appropriately resourced United Nations is the only way to ensure global stability and prosperity in this interdependent world."
"As the European Union set out in its statement to the General Assembly on 17 September: 'Without a shared effort to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, rich and poor countries alike face a future of increased instability."
"Failure in UN-led efforts to tackle the threat of terrorism and proliferation would endanger the prosperity of the developing world as much as the developed."
"The United Nations should not be a forum for countries to push individual agendas, but one in which the international community can agree common action for the benefit of all of the world's citizens.'"
"That seems to me the appropriate context in which to address a number of the important points raised by honourable Members today."
"Mr Millán Mon, Mr Lambsdorff and Mr Schmidt raised the issue of Security Council enlargement."
"In relation to this issue, while European Union partners agree that the Security Council should be reformed, it is the case that there is no European Union consensus on the model."
"On the related issue of whether the European Union should have a seat on the Security Council, I would respectfully remind Members of this Parliament that the United Nations Charter is very clear on this point: it allows only individual member states to hold seats on the Council, not regional organisations."
"There is, therefore, no question of a single EU seat on the Security Council."
"Mrs Kinnock paid fulsome tribute to the work that had been achieved and painted, I believe, an accurate picture of the progress that has been made, albeit against a context of much further work still to be undertaken."
"Her contribution is the rightful opportunity for me to pay tribute not just to her tireless efforts on this agenda over so many years – both before entering this Parliament and then thereafter – but also to the experience and expertise of so many other Members of this Parliament, which I believe has enriched the European Union's discussion of these issues and indeed Europe's voice in international fora."
"It will not surprise her to hear that I am indeed supportive of the references to the need for innovative funding mechanisms in relation to the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals."
"In relation to her other specific question, whether Member States are already starting to roll back on their aid volume commitments, I would categorically say no."
"The 25 Member States signed up to collectively provide at least 0.56% of GNI by 2010 and, in the case of the EU 15, to all spend at least 0.7% of their GNI on aid by 2015."
"As I told the party conference I addressed only a couple of days ago, to imagine that 15 countries within Europe would make such a commitment even only a few years ago would have been a dream for many of us who have long pursued that objective."
"The European Union reaffirmed that commitment in its statement at the Millennium Review Summit."
"The Commission and the Council will monitor progress on an annual basis."
"It is vital that guarantee is in place."
"I would also point out that the European Union is on course to exceed the targets for 2006, which is 0.39% of the EU average, set in 2002."
"There is no reason at this stage why we should not do so again."
"The next point raised was by Mr Portas."
"He expressed views towards the United States with which I candidly disagree."
"However, on the specific issue of non-proliferation, let me make clear the following points."
"It is important to reflect the fact that we all share the disappointment of many Member States within the United Nations, and indeed of many Members here in this Parliament, including Mr Leinen, about the lack of an international commitment to non-proliferation displayed in the ultimate inability of states to agree any language on these subjects."
"I can assure you all that although I speak for the Presidency today, the United Kingdom has worked tirelessly and literally to the last minute both nationally and in other fora representing the European Union as Presidency, to seek the best possible outcome on non-proliferation and disarmament at that Millennium Review Summit."
"I can also assure this House that we will continue to seek sensible and pragmatic solutions to overcome this deficit that will enhance the nuclear non-proliferation regime."
"Turning to the questions posed by Mr Guardans Cambó, I would respectfully say that smaller European Union countries did play a vital role in formulating the shared views of the European Union in the run-up to the Millennium Review Summit."
"To suggest otherwise would be a disservice to the contribution made by a number of countries other than the larger Member States of the European Union."
"Mrs Vaidere then went on to question whether there was a role for a new international organisation to replace the United Nations."
"Again, I would say respectfully that I have to disagree with that proposal."
"Rather, the challenge on the basis of what I and some Members of this Parliament have made clear today is that we need to give tangible expression to the words agreed back in the United Nations Millennium Review Summit only a few days ago, and ensure that the further words that are now on paper can be translated in the weeks and months ahead into further action."
"Mrs Belohorská addressed questions to the Commission about the Beijing follow-up summit."
"I can inform her that the European Union did not send anyone to the unofficial Beijing conference on 29 August and 1 September."
"The tenth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action was commemorated at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in March 2005."
"On that occasion the European Union was represented by the Luxembourg Minister for Gender Equality."
"Mr Deva made a powerful case for greater efficiency and effectiveness in the operation of the United Nations."
"I believe there has been a broad consensus throughout this Parliament today on the need for that further action to be taken now."
"Mr Pistelli asked – given his disappointment about the somewhat patchy nature of the progress, as he characterised it – in what areas the European Union could push further ahead for more progress to be made given the constraints of the summit's final document."
"I can give him the following assurances."
"We are encouraging interlocutors, including Kofi Annan, to move forward urgently on the reforms that are important to us, but were not included or were unsatisfactorily worded in that final Summit Outcome Document."
"Specifically, on the issue of management reform – about which there has been much discussion in this debate today – Kofi Annan has been mandated by the summit outcome to propose further reforms for the UN organisation and secretariat in the first quarter of 2006."
"We have already urged the Secretary-General to make bold proposals, not least in the wake of the oil-for-food scandal, as it is important that such steps are taken."
"The European Union supports the Summit Outcome Document's strong condemnation of terrorism – a matter that was again addressed by a number of honourable Members – and its call for an effective UN counter-terrorism strategy."
"However, we believe the text should have gone further."
"For nearly a decade the United Nations has been discussing a global convention on terrorism that seeks itself to define terrorism."
"We want to see that definition agreed in terms that are unequivocal."
"It would leave no doubt what an act of terrorism is and that such acts are utterly unacceptable."
"Finally, let me make this other specific point."
"We agree entirely with the UN Secretary-General that the lack of non-proliferation and disarmament language in the Summit Outcome Document was a significant disappointment."
"The European Union worked literally until the last moment to try to broker agreement on those key issues."
"Despite this setback, I reaffirm that the European Union will continue to seek out opportunities to strengthen the non-proliferation regime in all relevant fora."
"Mr Romeva i Rueda expressed his disappointment on the Security Council."
"I have spoken about that already."
"We share, however, the disappointment that he expressed on the failure to pursue a treaty on the international arms trade."
"Again, I am conscious that I speak to this Parliament today representing the Presidency rather than any one individual Member State."
"However, I can assure him of our continuing commitment to this issue, not least because my own party was recently re-elected in the United Kingdom on an explicit manifesto commitment to try and take forward progress on an arms trade treaty."
"Mrs Sinnott said that even the tidiest house sometimes needed to be spring cleaned."
"I certainly agree that reform has a real contribution to make to the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals and that is why we are so determined that the words of September are translated into action in the weeks and months ahead."
"Mr Dillen quoted General Charles de Gaulle."
"I was tempted to reply in kind, but I shall resist that and leave that for another day."
"Instead he went on to raise the question again of United Nations Security Council enlargement and I have spoken at some length about the position of the Presidency in relation to that question."
"Mr Barón Crespo raised an issue which frankly I expected we might have heard more of in the course of the debate today, which is the centrality of the World Trade Organization talks, just ten working weeks away, in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals."
"It is hard to overstate the significance of the challenge that collectively Europe, the United States and the other representatives of the World Trade Organization face when they arrive, and in the weeks before arriving in Hong Kong."
"There is simply no doubt that 2005 will already be remembered as a year of real progress in relation to debt reduction and increases in aid flows, for all the reasons that I have described."
"The opportunity for Europe now is once again to grasp the leadership potential that is within its grasp and move actively and aggressively to try and make sure that the very development dimension to the original Doha Declaration is given expression in Hong Kong."
"I was heartened in that regard by the remarks of Pascal Lamy last week, in his first press conference as Secretary General of the WTO, for I believe that only by being clear as to the development dimension of the Doha round in Hong Kong, will we see the kind of progress that I believe many Members of this Parliament would wish to see made in early December."
"Mr Coûteaux raised the issue of a seat at the United Nations, which I have already addressed, and Mr Martínez Martínez spoke of the United States."
"As I hope I have already made clear in my contribution in winding up this debate, it is with some relief that I speak on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union, rather than any other Administration, so I will leave it for others to answer for the actions of those outside the European Union."
"Mrs Segelström raised the issue of terrorism and the need for more cooperation, something I wholeheartedly agree with, and heard very strongly articulated in this Parliament when Charles Clarke, the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, made a powerful case that it is not by building thicker or higher walls that we will effectively counteract terrorism, but rather by deeper and more fulfilling cooperation between the Member States of the European Union."
"She also made an important point in terms of gender representation in the high levels of office represented at the United Nations Millennium Review Summit."
"I certainly acknowledge the significance of that point and therefore respectfully suggest that perhaps the Commissioner is better qualified than I to answer it."
"The final contribution came from Mr dos Santos, in which he explained his own presence at an important international meeting that preceded the Millennium Review Summit."
"Again, I would simply take this opportunity to reiterate the sincere gratitude, both of the Commission, I believe, and certainly of the Presidency-in-Office, for the tireless efforts of many Members of this Parliament in pursuing what was achieved in the United Nations Millennium Review Summit."
"I fully accept that there is some disappointment that the Summit document ultimately did not go as far as many of us would have wished it to, but I am absolutely convinced that but for the effective action of members of the European Union, we would not have achieved the progress that we did in New York."
"For that, I believe, we can feel a real and genuine sense of shared pride."
". Mr President, I shall be brief and just say at the beginning that we were delighted to see a parliamentary delegation in New York."
"I thank Mrs Kinnock, Mr Deva and Mr Lambsdorff for having been there."
"I must say that this was very positive because you have seen for yourselves the positive and the rather negative side of this Millennium Summit."
"Many of you have mentioned seeing the glass as half-full or half-empty."
"The picture was a mixed one, but I think it was very important that this Millennium Summit ended with a declaration from where we can go on, and this is the most important thing."
"Knowing the UN as I do – I was chief of protocol for Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1994 and 1995 – I know that it can only be as good as its member states, and as good as the member states that are ready to go for a compromise."
"There are 191 member states, so it is not easy for a European Union with 25 member states and some associated member states with the same positions to bring the issue forward."
"The European Union has done a very good job, and this has also been mentioned by Secretary-General Kofi Annan and many others."
"It is true that in the Human Rights Council, as I mentioned at the very beginning, on the definition of terrorism for instance, we have not achieved everything."
"Let me just go into this question a little."
"I would say the clear and unqualified condemnation by all governments of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations committed by whomsoever and wherever is a very important element, and it is a strong push, given that this agreement has been negotiated for nearly ten years."
"There is a good chance that at this General Assembly before the end of the year there might even be a conclusion of this agreement."
"If this were so this would be another positive outcome."
"Let me also say with regard to women's issues that I was present at the evening dinner of the women's network."
"I was a foreign minister, but now I am a Commissioner for external relations."
"It is very important to think of the other part of the population that is not yet always represented in an appropriate manner, and therefore we think women can make a special contribution to peace and to peace-building, on which we have placed particular emphasis."
"I would also like to say that the issues that we have mentioned today – and the issues of dialogue and alliance between civilisations and cultures – are a very crucial item."
"It has been around for a long time, but now it has been mentioned as a new concept and we will certainly work and cooperate with this concept because this might bring the peoples at large again to a common understanding that there has to be tolerance on religious civilisations, but that at the same time we share common values."
"On the whole I can again say that the EU is indeed the natural partner of the United Nations and both organisations have been born out of the same experience, the experience of war, and are founded on the same conviction that acting together is much better than acting alone, even if we sometimes have to compromise in order to go on."
"But there is a very strong commitment from our side to go on, with an excellent President of the General Assembly."
"– Mr President, I had asked the Commission and the Council for their opinion on when Parliament can expect the representatives of Commission and Council to be combined in New York and at the other sites of the United Nations, in order to achieve better coherence in the Union’s representation at the United Nations."
"I should be grateful if the Council and the Commission would respond to this."
"Mr President, Mr Lambsdorff, you know as well as I do that the Constitution has not yet progressed and has not been ratified."
"The Council Secretariat now has an office in New York; the Commission has observer status at the United Nations, and we work extremely closely together."
"Even so, there are at present no plans to amalgamate the two."
"– I have received six motions for resolution(1) in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 29 September 2005 at 12 noon."
"The next item is questions to the Council (B6-0331/2005)."
"Have the Member States given a firm undertaking regarding the separate collection of waste by category?"
"What view does the Council take of the implementation of such measures to date in the Member States, in particular regarding the collection, destruction and recycling of chemical, toxic, lubricant and radioactive wastes?"
"Does the Council consider it necessary to heighten awareness of the problem and provide funding for measures such as the above to protect the environment and health of future European generations?"
". The Council considers that separate collection systems have been and will continue to be widely implemented to achieve the objectives of Community directives on waste."
"Separate collection leads to higher recycling rates and makes final disposal safer."
"A number of Community directives on specific waste streams provide for separate collections of wastes, especially for end-of-life products that would otherwise enter the municipal solid waste stream."
"Much has been achieved in Member States through Community legislation to meet this environmental challenge."
"Important hazardous waste, such as waste oils and batteries, has been tackled."
"Recycling and recovery targets have been set for some key complex waste flows, such as packaging, end-of-life vehicles and waste from electrical and electronic equipment."
"Some of these measures have still to be implemented in some Member States."
"Changing behaviour, whether that of producers, consumers or public authorities, takes time."
"This is particularly true with regard to achieving a specific environmental outcome requiring significant investment in infrastructure."
"Therefore, future initiatives on waste will need to have realistic timescales to allow the stakeholders concerned sufficient time to plan their investment."
"The experience of Member States shows the importance of heightening public awareness of waste-related issues."
"I am confident that the Commission will take full account of this when it brings forward its thematic strategy on waste."
"– Thank you for your reply, Minister, but when I went down to Greece from Brussels I got the opposite impression from the one you have given and I ask the Council if it has evaluated the direct and indirect damage to date and the damage which will be caused in all the Member States from their failure to comply with the directives."
". Clearly each Member State is subject to the obligations imposed upon it by European Union law."
"Therefore it is important to recognise that, particularly in relation to directives that have been passed, there are processes whereby infringement procedures can follow."
"Whilst we recognise that not all Member States have implemented EU waste legislation fully, in general I would suggest that implementation of European Union environmental law has actually improved in recent years."
"The counter-terrorism provisions adopted by certain Member States, under the guise of the fight against terrorism, means that the EU must now face the reality that one of the effects of the terrorist threat is that the hard-won liberties, which underpin the shared values and principles of the Union, are being challenged and undermined."
"In the light of the bombings in Madrid on 11 March 2004 and in London on 7 July 2005, the EU is now facing a defining moment in its approach to combating this attack on the European way of life."
"How does the Council, under the leadership of the UK Presidency, plan to work together to overcome national differences and the bureaucratic hurdles within the 25 EU Member States in order to develop a harmonised approach to combating terrorism which achieves a balance between providing security to EU citizens whilst simultaneously guaranteeing their human rights and civil liberties, regardless of religious beliefs or ethnic origins?"
". I really could not agree more with the honourable Member about the importance of these issues, not least following the attacks in Madrid, and in London on 7 July."
"The Council has always endeavoured to strike a balance between providing security to European Union citizens while simultaneously guaranteeing their human rights and civil liberties, regardless of religious belief or ethnic origin."
"On 13 June 2002, the Council adopted a framework decision on combating terrorism."
"This framework decision approximates Member State legislation as regards acts of terrorism, offences relating to a terrorist group and offences linked to terrorist activities."
"It is specifically mentioned in Article 1 of the framework decision that it 'shall not have the effect of altering the obligation to respect fundamental rights and fundamental legal principles as enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaty'."
"It is in particular in defence of those rights that the Member States need to combat terrorism, which is the antithesis of human rights as we see it in democratic societies."
"In his address to the European Parliament on 7 September, my colleague, the British Home Secretary Charles Clarke, emphasised the need to find a balance between civil liberties and the increase in security."
"On that occasion the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, also stressed the need for a balance between law enforcement activities and the protection of fundamental rights."
"May I, once again, welcome the Minister back to this House."
"It is very pleasing to see you here, to provide a detailed answer to the question that I had tabled."
"You make reference to statements made by your colleague, the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom, Mr Clarke."
"May I draw your attention to comments that he has made since the date that you mention and ask you to what extent the Presidency is committed to doing away with certain provisions of the Convention on Human Rights?"
". Let me address the question by being very clear that the priority of our Presidency, not least given the attacks in Madrid and London, is to give renewed momentum to the EU Counter-terrorism Action Plan, which has been agreed by all Member States."
"We believe that, by focusing our efforts on this plan, we can achieve the harmonisation and establish the common ground of which I spoke earlier."
"Mr President-in-Office, the European arrest warrant is a very sensible and welcome measure to try and counter terrorism, but it has not been implemented by several Member States because of a fear that people extradited under the warrant will not receive a fair trial, appropriate legal support or appropriate language support."
"Will you examine this, as the President-in-Office, to see if you can reassure all Member States that the arrest warrant may be implemented in full?"
". I can give an undertaking to the honourable Member that this is an issue which we should have concern for, given our commitment not only to the common arrest warrant but also to action to take forward a common evidence warrant across the European Union."
"If there are practical reasons, given concerns within Member States, which are preventing the deepening of the cooperation of which I spoke earlier, then that is exactly within the concern of the Council."
"In particular I will ensure that the honourable Member's remarks are brought to the attention of the Home Secretary."
"Is the Council aware of any website maintained by a European public authority which is better designed to frustrate the ability of citizens to access information than that of the Council of Ministers?"
". First of all, I should like to congratulate the European Parliament on the launch of its own website before I try to defend the Council's website."
"Let me do my best."
"The objective of the Council's website is twofold: to provide information on the role and activities of the Council and to enable the institution to comply with its obligations as regards access to documents."
"Thus, in addition to the homepage of Javier Solana, the Secretary General of the Council and High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Council website provides access to press releases and a wide range of information of particular interest to the media on the activities of the Council within the different policy areas."
"In addition, the website includes the public register of Council documents and provides information concerning the use of the register and about the rules governing transparency and access to documents."
"It should be pointed out that the somewhat specialised Council website has been designed with a view to avoiding, as far as possible, overlap and duplication of work in relation to the interinstitutional website Europa, which is managed by the European Commission and addressed to the public in general."
"'Yes, Minister!'"
"Is the Presidency-in-Office aware that when asked to consider the inadequacies of the Council's website, journalists and NGOs seem at a loss whether to laugh hysterically or to gnash their teeth in anger?"
"Would he agree that if the European Union is to connect better with its citizens, then the public sources of information need to reflect the principles of openness and transparency?"
"Will he take steps to initiate a review and public consultation aimed at sweeping aside the backward-looking approach of the Council Secretariat and providing the public with a first-class source of honest, factual and accurate information?"
". On the basis of my inquiries since this question was tabled, I have some sympathy with the points raised by the honourable Member."
"I can assure him that the structure and content of the Council's website undergoes continuous review and this process will be continued in parallel with the improvements to the Europa website, of which I spoke a moment or two ago."
"I feel the only point of difference between us, in terms of the question that was put to me, is to suggest that in the first instance the public should visit the Council website, rather than the Europa website."
"I think there is a genuine question as to how we ensure the kind of duplication, which has been all too common amongst the government websites of Member States, and ensure that the product offered to the citizenry of Europe better reflects the single access point that we wish the public to move towards."
"That, most clearly, in terms of the public, is the Europa website."
"The Commission has recently announced its action plan to improve communicating in Europe and I am sure that will have a direct bearing on the Europa site."
"Mr President-in-Office, perhaps you would like to visit a website that really does frustrate one, that really does contain inaccuracies."
"That is the UK Liberal Democrat website, which, for example, claims that Liberal Democrats are the main opposition to the British Government and that they have policies."
". Ever mindful of my responsibilities as a representative of the Presidency, rather than speaking as a partisan figure here today, I would respectfully suggest that those inaccuracies are perhaps not so much technological as ideological."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council to kindly answer Mr Davis' original question: is the Council aware of any website maintained by a public authority which is better designed to frustrate?"
"He did not actually answer the question."
"Can we therefore take it that he agrees that the Council's website is the worst of all public websites?"
". I suggest to the honourable Member that if he believes it is an efficient and effective use of the Council's time to visit every public website on the worldwide web, then I would respectfully disagree with him."
"The EU institutions are required by Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001(1) on access to documents to keep a register of documents and to grant direct access to documents in electronic form."
"Despite recent improvements, the Council Register is not organised in a user-friendly way."
"Will the Council reorganise its Register and its website, perhaps in a way similar to the European Parliament’s Legislative Observatory and create special webpages for each meeting which allow citizens to trace all relevant agenda documents and follow the decision-making process through its various stages?"
". As pointed out by the honourable Member, the European Union institutions are required by law to keep a register of documents and to grant direct access to documents in electronic form."
"By setting up its public register of documents, which I understand became operational in January of 1999, the Council fulfilled that requirement well before the relevant regulation entered into force."
"The number of users of the Council register has been steadily increasing ever since."
"Thus in 2004, close to 300 000 different users logged on to the Council's public document register, as opposed to roughly 180 000 in 2003."
"This represents an almost 63% increase in the number of users in one year."
"The total number of visits increased by just under 20%: 920 000 in 2004 against 770 000 in 2003, representing more than 2 500 visits per day."
"Consultations in terms of number of screens viewed totalled more than 5.5 million."
"As these figures on the use by the public of the register of Council documents indicate, the register has indeed become a frequently used research tool for citizens wishing to closely follow the development of Community affairs."
"This is all the more understandable as the Council register is constantly updated via an automatic archiving system."
"By 9 September 2005, the Council register contained references to more than 640 000 documents."
"Moreover, a considerable amount of Council documents are automatically made available, in full text format, via the Council register as soon as they are produced."
"Thus in 2004, around 70 000 documents, or roughly 60% of the more than 100 000 documents produced and registered that year, could be consulted full-text online immediately upon circulation."
"Provisional agendas for meetings of the Council and its preparatory bodies can be consulted online as soon as they have been circulated, thus enabling users of the register to easily identify the reference numbers of documents discussed at any given meeting."
"Moreover, apart from the document number entry, the users of the register can search for documents on a given subject via other entries of the register, such as the meeting date, the interinstitutional file number or a subject code."
"Nevertheless, in order to further improve the quality of the register, the Council will study the technical feasibility of performing an automatic search via interactive agendas for documents on a given issue or that are part of the same file."
"I should like to thank the Presidency, but let me give an example."
"If you put 'data retention' – a subject much in the news – in the subject-matter search box, you get no documents at all."
"It is as if Charles Clarke's frenzy of activity on this topic was a mirage."
"If you put the words 'data retention' in the title box you get 45 documents, but with no way of navigating what meeting they relate to."
"You have not answered the specific request in my question."
"Will you copy the Parliament's Legislative Observatory to make the Council website easy to navigate?"
"If you use the help section on the website, you get 'regarding suffixes on documents'."
"There may be multiple suffixes indicating the different versions, for example, REV 1 (the first revision), REV 2 COR 1 (the first corrigendum to the second revision), COR 1 REV 2 (the second revision of the first corrigendum)."
"I do not believe that helps public enlightenment."
". I am not entirely convinced that public enlightenment is assisted when what I clearly stated in the final paragraph of my answer appears not to have been heard."
"So, let me repeat it for the record."
"In order to further improve the quality of the register, the Council will study the technical feasibility of performing an automatic search via interactive agendas for documents on a given issue or being part of the same file."
"The Fisheries Partnership Agreements concluded with third countries are totally unfair and extremely damaging for the local population, and they have environmentally disastrous consequences."
"Like WWF, Oxfam and some others, I strongly believe that they do not constitute ‘sustainable development’."
"Could an inquiry be carried out into these Agreements?"
"Will the Council support this position and stop these appalling fisheries deals?"
". The Council is aware that various organisations have voiced concerns over the alleged adverse effects of fisheries agreements between the Community and third countries."
"The Commission, in response to such criticism, issued a communication on 27 December 2002 on an integrated framework for fisheries partnership agreements with third countries."
"Subsequently, in July 2004, the Council endorsed the policy changes advocated by the Commission in its communication."
"It is important to stress the word 'partnership'."
"This is about more than just buying up fishing rights from third countries and denuding their stocks."
"The Community will enter into a dialogue with the third country on the basis of scientific evidence to establish whether there are surplus fishing possibilities which the Community vessels can extract sustainably."
"The Community will discuss with the third country how the money paid can be used for the benefit of the people of that country."
"As these are fisheries partnership agreements, the Council will seek to ensure that this money is to the benefit of the local fisheries sector, including fishermen and the coastal populations."
"Finally, in the preparation of new agreements or renewal of existing ones, the Commission systematically presents to the Council assessment reports on the effects of these agreements."
"The Council considers these agreements to be beneficial to both parties and looks forward to concluding future fisheries partnership agreements with third countries."
"The United Kingdom Presidency is also working with the Commission to host a seminar later this year on the question of third-country agreements."
"Minister, I find it absolutely extraordinary that a government such as yours and that of your leader Tony Blair – who has made such a big play on Africa, what is going wrong in Africa, and what we have to do to try to help Africa – can be turning a blind eye to this issue."
"I am afraid that these third-country fisheries deals are the most appalling combination of European commercial greed and bad African government corruption."
"There is absolutely no question if you look at every independent report that in environmental terms these fisheries deals off the west coast of Africa are the environmental equivalent of setting fire to the Serengeti!"
"The local populations are being left without any hope of earning a living and I am very disappointed that you will not at least promise us an inquiry."
". I have no doubt that the honourable Member is sincere in his comments and I am respectful of the organisations that he consulted in preparing his contribution to this debate today, so I would be grateful if he could forward, both to the Commission and to the Council, the evidence he referred to in his question and I will ensure that it is passed on to the relevant officials."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"I clearly do not have the unerring experience of fisheries questions that my colleague, Mr Farage, has just demonstrated."
"I did serve, however, representing Cornwall and Plymouth."
"Fishing in that part of the world relies totally on partnerships and agreements."
"If there were no agreements – and I disagree with Mr Farage here – what happens is that a number of mavericks simply abuse the quantity of fish stocks present."
"It seems to me an excellent idea that the European Union concludes these agreements, and I personally hope that they continue."
". I have great sympathy with the point that the honourable Member has made."
"It is a debate which is in some way similar to the debate on economic partnership agreements in general."
"Few would disagree with the principle that partnership agreements of this kind can genuinely be of benefit to the developing countries concerned."
"However, if in practice the effect of those agreements is inimical and detrimental to their very objectives, then that is rightfully a matter of concern."
"That is why I have undertaken, if evidence is produced, to pass it on to the relevant individuals."
"It is extraordinary that Mr Farage should raise this issue when he barely attends the Committee on Fisheries, and I would urge him to attend on a more regular basis, so that he can put forward his views on this."
"I worry that what he is referring to is every fishing agreement."
"For example, the Norwegian fishing agreement is vital for Scottish fishermen."
"He needs to be consistent in his approach."
". I shall resist the very considerable opportunity that has been presented to me to discuss the inconsistencies inherent in UKIP's position and simply say that I fully recognise, not least on the basis of the tireless work in Scotland of the honourable lady who asked the question, that fisheries partnership agreements can have a very important role to play."
"It is a clear example of where working independently rather than in partnership offers no future either to Europe or, I would suggest, to fish stocks."
"Whilst the minorities in Kosovo have guaranteed seats in Parliament, in response to pressure from the Radical Party led by Vojslav Seselj, who is facing trial in The Hague, Serbia has been turned into a single constituency with no local seats and a 5% threshold."
"As a result, the ethnic minorities living in potential crisis areas, that is, the Vojvodina, the Sandzak region around Novi Pazar and the Presevo Valley, have been excluded on a de facto basis from involvement in parliamentary politics, even though they make up a majority of the population in their home regions."
"Does the Council acknowledge the risks which may stem from this imbalance in the demands made on Kosovo and Serbia respectively, and what impact will this imbalance have on the preparations for the EU Treaty negotiations with Belgrade?"
". The future of Serbia and Montenegro is within the European family, as I was indeed able to communicate when I recently visited the Western Balkans and had the opportunity to meet with the authorities in that country."
"It follows that the participation of all ethnic groups in the democratic process is crucial to that country moving towards a European future."
"However, we do not recognise that the situation in Serbia is as bleak as the question implies."
"While the political situations in Kosovo and Serbia are not directly analogous, we judge that there are opportunities for minorities in Serbia to enjoy full involvement in parliamentary politics."
"One of the first measures taken by the new Serbian Parliament in early 2004 was to abolish the threshold for parliamentary representation – that is, 5% – in the case of parties representing ethnic minorities."
"Therefore at future general elections minorities are also likely to be represented in the parliament."
"The Serbian local election law stipulates a 3% threshold but interethnic relation councils are also set up in ethnically mixed municipalities and comprise members of all ethnic communities, accounting for more than 1% of the municipal population."
"In addition, questions concerning national minorities can be brought to the attention of the central government of Serbia, notably through the National Council of Ethnic Minorities, established in 2004."
"That is a forum in which all relevant issues for minorities can be discussed."
"We hope to open stabilisation and association agreement negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro during our Presidency."
"To conclude this agreement Belgrade will need to meet a range of conditions set down by the European Union."
"To eventually join the European Union Belgrade will need to have met all the Copenhagen political criteria."
"The honourable Member is right to highlight the need for democratic standards in Serbia to be at the heart of this process."
"Mr President, I am obliged to the President-in-Office for his very good, very specific answer."
"I should just like to add that the Preševo Valley, that is to say, the Albanian-inhabited region of southern Serbia, has no parliamentary representation at all, whilst the Serbian minority in Kosovo is guaranteed seats, at least in theory: they have not yet been taken up."
"Could the President-in-Office envisage, as part of a solution to the Kosovo issue, endeavours towards a bilateral settlement – so that borders do not have to be changed, because of course we do not want to change any borders – which gives the Albanians in Serbia the same rights as the Serbians in Kosovo?"
". With the greatest of respect to the questioner I do not believe, especially at this time of some sensitivity and anticipation, that it is right to anticipate Ambassador Eide's report in relation to Kosovo."
"We only have to wait a little longer for that report, and it in the light of it will be better able to continue the discussion on the final status of Kosovo."
"Mr President, Mr Alexander, I would like to call to your attention the fact that there is a province in northern Serbia named Vojvodina that had the same status as Kosovo before 1989, whereas now it is practically a ‘territory on paper’ only, without a status."
"No one knows why its status cannot be restored five years after the fall of Milosevic."
"Since the large native Hungarian and Croatian minorities do not have a representation in the parliament of Belgrade, they are politically discriminated against in Vojvodina."
"When saying that there are positive ethnic changes in Serbia, I wonder whether you are aware of the fact that members of a European nation, namely of the Hungarian nation are persecuted and assaulted only because they speak Hungarian, while the police refuses to record their complaints, there are more and more judges of a doubtful reputation from Kosovo and Krajina in the region, and now there are murders ..."
". I would respectfully suggest to the questioner that an awareness is needed of what the legitimate responsibilities of the European Union Presidency are and what the responsibilities of the Serbian Government are."
"In relation to the specific matter of concern, the recent attack on József Kasza, the Chairman of the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians, and the general position of the Hungarian minority, I believe a quick and decisive approach by the Serbian Government did much to calm the fears of the ethnic Hungarian community that the attack on Kasza might be the beginning of a series of further attacks."
"We are thankful that no one was hurt, according to the reports we have received, but I am aware of the concerns that the honourable Member has expressed."
"Mr President, I am glad that negotiations with Croatia are now actually set to begin in a few days’ time."
"This represents a considerable step forward for the British Presidency."
"When does the President-in-Office expect accession negotiations with Belgrade to begin?"
". There seems to be a presumption inherent in the question which I am not in a position to echo in my response."
"There are still further reports to be received in terms of the position of Croatia, not least in terms of the Croatia Task Force."
"That is where matters rest at the moment – no further than that."
"The Directorate-General for Foundations in Turkey has announced its intention of renting out property belonging to religious minority philanthropic foundations and which had previously been expropriated, persisting in its practice of violating the property rights of religious minorities."
"At the same time, the Turkish Government is tacitly consenting to this practice and has also brought before the national assembly a draft law on religious foundations, which stipulates that the Turkish State will return to its rightful owners only property under its jurisdiction and not property which has been sold illegally to third parties."
"Is the Council aware of the practice followed by the Directorate-General for Foundations and the draft law tabled by the Turkish Government?"
"Will it include this draft law on the agenda for the discussions it is to hold with the Turkish authorities?"
"What steps will it take to safeguard the property rights of religious minorities in Turkey, in the light of the accession negotiations due to begin on 3 October 2005?"
". We are aware of the issues raised by the honourable Member."
"While freedom of religious belief is guaranteed in the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, and the European Commission's 2004 Regular Report on Turkey's progress towards accession noted that freedom to worship is largely unhampered, important issues in this area remain outstanding."
"Under the revised accession partnership adopted in May 2003, Turkey is required inter alia to establish conditions for the functioning of non-Muslim religious communities which are in line with the practice of European Union Member States."
"However, the Council notes that some Muslim and non-Muslim religious minorities and communities continue to experience difficulties connected with legal personality, property rights, training, residence rights and work permits for Turkish and non-Turkish clergy, schools and internal management."
"The European Union is particularly worried by the continuous confiscation by the state of property belonging to non-Muslim religious foundations."
"The European Union has urged Turkey to adopt promptly a law on foundations that fully complies with European standards and expects the Commission's comments on the draft law that were sent by Commissioner Rehn to the Turkish Foreign Minister Gül in June to be seriously considered."
"The European Union has also urged Turkey to reopen the Halki Greek Orthodox Seminary."
"As the honourable Member is well aware, on 16 and 17 December 2004 the European Council, when deciding that Turkey sufficiently fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria to open accession negotiations, clearly stated that the Union would continue to monitor closely the progress of political reforms in Turkey."
"The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that it continues to follow developments in this area very closely indeed."
"– Mr President-in-Office, the European Parliament considered, in a resolution passed just today, that the specific legal arrangements are inadequate."
"Does the Council share this appraisal?"
"Have you made any comments on the specific bill?"
"Do you intend to put these issues on the negotiation agenda and, if so, when?"
"While we are on the subject of religious freedoms, does the British Presidency have any comments on the unacceptable and disparaging treatment of the Pope by the Turkish Government, following his invitation from the Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch to visit Istanbul?"
". I am not sure whether the honourable Member had the opportunity, as I did this morning, to participate in a three-hour debate on the issue of Turkey in this Parliament."
"I can assure you that the British Presidency is fully aware of the range of issues involved in Turkish accession."
"I would however suggest that many of us believe that the very process which Turkey has been through, and which it would continue to move through, is the best guarantee that these very issues that need to be addressed are being addressed and will continue to be addressed in the future."
"Obviously, the issue of religious freedom is absolutely critical in negotiations with Turkey."
"In the next few weeks the NGO First Step Forum will be visiting Turkey to investigate the situation on the ground and I will be happy to forward a copy of its report to the President-in-Office."
"Can the President-in-Office reassure me that religious freedom and expression thereof will be emphasised throughout the accession process with Turkey?"
". I can give that assurance but I would also point out to the honourable Member that leaders of Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Syrian Orthodox churches in Turkey have said that as a result of the European Union harmonisation reforms, their communities now find it easier to worship and that attitudes towards them have changed."
"I fully recognise that there is a great deal of further work still to be done, and that is why I pay due tribute to the work that Mrs Stihler and other members of the NGO community have undertaken in this field."
"Nonetheless, I think the words from the leaders of the Catholic, the Greek Orthodox and the Syrian Orthodox churches in Turkey to which I have just referred tell their own story about the real progress that has already been made."
"Following the unimpeded return of the convicted terrorist fugitives Niall Connolly, James Monaghan and Martin McCauley to the Republic of Ireland from Colombia, and given the EU’s declared commitment to support the fight against international terrorism, what steps has the Council of Ministers taken to ensure that the Irish Government does not provide sanctuary for these international terrorists, and is it satisfied that Europol did everything possible to thwart their return?"
". As I made clear earlier this month in this Parliament, this is not an issue for the Council, but for the Irish and Colombian governments."
"Minister, is that answer not a pitiful and cowardly cop-out?"
"The Council, with collegiate emphasis, has repeatedly stressed its commitment to the fight against international terrorism and yet when faced with flagrant contradiction of that commitment through a Member State harbouring notorious international terrorists, all it can do is shrug its shoulders in lamentable indifference."
"This is a challenge to the Council."
"Is it in a position to prove its credentials in fighting international terrorism, or is it only interested in ducking its responsibility?"
"You can do better."
"The question is: have you the will to do better, or is all the talk mere platitudes and empty words?"
". With the greatest of respect to the questioner, I would suggest that the issue is not one of will, but one of locus, and given that the Council has received no request from either of the two governments involved, the Council does not have a direct locus in this matter."
"I find the President-in-Office's remarks quite amazing."
"Considering that he is part of a government that has taken such a strong line on international terrorism, the way in which he has ducked the issue – his cop-out here this evening – is totally amazing."
"Would he not agree that he should be encouraging the two governments of the Republic of Ireland and Colombia to ensure that there is no hiding place for those people who were convicted in Colombia, sent to jail, and who then absconded?"
"Would he not agree that he should be leading to ensure that in the light of international terrorism he takes a positive role and does not try to duck out of this position?"
". It will not surprise you that I reject the terms of the accusation levelled at me by the supplementary questioner."
"I am somewhat intrigued, given the position of his party in relation to the importance of the nation state, that he does not accept the basic legal proposition as to where the legal locus to take action in relation to this matter lies."
"That legal locus lies with the Member State and I would suggest that, rather than rehearse the arguments that we first had the opportunity to discuss in this Parliament earlier this month, he should express his concern directly to those governments which have it within their powers to take action on the matter."
"I am not that keen to get into this issue, but I simply want to say that the legal and justice provisions in the Republic of Ireland are already under way."
"That system is independent of the political influence of any party in the Republic of Ireland, as I am sure the system also is in the UK, including Northern Ireland."
"I want to appeal to you to take Question 9, which is the next one and in my name."
"I would particularly like to put a supplementary to the Council representative on the issue of the temporary agency workers directive."
". Mr President, I am grateful to you for that direction."
"I would suggest that, given the concern expressed by the questioner and the pressure I am under to catch a plane, it might be best if we were to correspond so that he can have a full reply to his concerns in relation to the directive."
"My question is Question No 32 on the list, but you have already answered by saying that it will be answered in writing."
"I look forward to that reply."
"I hope the Minister catches his plane. I look forward to continuing this discussion."
"Questions 9 to 38 will be answered in writing(2)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the Commission declaration on Belarus."
". Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner had very much hoped to be with you to discuss this point."
"She has been highly engaged developing the Commission's activities on Belarus since we took office."
"On behalf of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and the Commission, I am pleased to have this opportunity to exchange views with you on the situation in Belarus and on the Commission's work to support democratisation and civil society."
"The Commission is deeply concerned about the absence of democracy and the rule of law and the lack of respect for human rights in Belarus."
"Belarus is in clear breach of its international commitments under the OSCE and UN charters."
"We have recently seen a worrying deterioration in the situation."
"The regime restricts human rights even more and is taking further steps against non-governmental organisations, undermining the rights of minorities, imprisoning citizens for political reasons and curtailing freedom of expression."
"We have condemned firmly the acts of intimidation by the Belarussian authorities against the Union of the Poles in Belarus."
"These incidents occur in the context of growing repression of political parties, NGOs and independent media outlets in Belarus."
"We believe such interference undermines minority rights, thereby contravening standards of governance to which Belarus has signed up as part of its commitments to the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe."
"In addition, Belarus has introduced decrees that place even more restrictions on foreign assistance, thereby isolating itself and the Belarussian people still further."
"You may ask how the Commission has reacted."
"In response to the growing repression in Belarus we have increased our funding for democratisation and human rights by transferring EUR 2 million from the TACIS Programme to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights Programme, one of the two instruments which do not require the consent of the government."
"The TACIS Programme was refocused to address the needs of the population with the full participation of the civil society."
"This year we have already signed 27 small contracts with NGOs worth EUR 3 million."
"We shall issue a further call for proposals under the EIDHR Programme in October, with a total budget of EUR 420 000."
"We are also in the process of allocating more than EUR 1.7 million for three specific new projects for Belarus."
"These will be implemented by OSCE - ODIHR, the UNDP and the Nordic Council of Ministers."
"These projects will focus on human rights, democratisation, civil society and independent educational institutions such as the European Humanities University-in-exile."
"We shall continue to address the broader needs of the population with the TACIS Programme and focus on health and social issues, higher education, training and environmental matters."
"When alleviating Chernobyl-related problems, our approach is to fund project proposals put forward by the local communities."
"One of the most significant developments in our assistance is our support for independent broadcasting."
"In response to the suggestions from this Parliament and elsewhere, starting from 1 November we shall fund a daily radio news programme."
"The idea is to increase awareness of human rights and democracy issues in the Belarussian population, and provide it with factual news on developments inside and outside Belarus, which would not otherwise be available."
"The broadcasting will kick off in Russian, and Belarussian programmes will be phased in as soon as possible."
"The start of independent broadcasting is a major step, and I am delighted that we were the first donor to launch such initiatives for Belarus."
"In addition, we shall open a Commission office in Minsk early next year."
"The office will be headed by a ."
"This will facilitate our contacts with local civil society and it will also assist our coordination efforts and the follow-up of our activities."
"We have also looked at how best to ensure that all our policies towards Belarus are consistent and coherent."
"In trade we have carried out an investigation into violations of trade union rights under the Generalised System of Preferences and looked into the definition of annual textiles quotas."
"We also keep the EU list of senior officials covered by the visa ban under continual review."
"The Commission has taken the lead in the discussions on how to improve cooperation among the donors active in Belarus."
"We have organised three donors meetings this year."
"The first one was in Vilnius in March, followed by one in Kiev in July, and the latest one was held last week in Brussels."
"The process of democratisation in Belarus and the wellbeing of its people are matters that are very close to our heart and to the Commission's objectives."
"We are doing all we can to support those striving for the development of a democratic and pluralistic society in Belarus."
"In particular, in addition to keeping up our focus on democratisation and human rights, we encourage the Belarussian democratic forces to work closely together."
"This is crucial in view of next year's presidential elections."
"We look forward to welcoming Belarus as a full partner in the European neighbourhood policy, as soon as the country lives up to its commitments on democracy, the rule of law and human rights, not only in words but also in deeds."
". Mr President, earlier today the House adopted a resolution on the legacy of the Solidarity movement born 25 years ago."
"It was more than a historical resolution, however, as it was also partly an appeal to solidarity within the European Union."
"We are now working on a resolution concerning Belarus, and this resolution should be an expression of our European solidarity towards those who need solidarity shown to them at present, as is certainly true of our friends in Belarus, the Belarussian people."
"One might well ask why another resolution on Belarus is needed, when the last one was only adopted in July, just before the summer break."
"As the Commissioner rightly pointed out, however, the situation in Belarus is changing very rapidly."
"The political situation is getting worse with every month."
"The latest development to come to our notice concerned Mr Lukashenko’s administration’s crackdown on the democratically elected leadership of the Union of Poles in Belarus."
"The whole of the civilised world saw for itself how the largest organisation in Belarussian civil society was persecuted and its leaders brutally deprived of their office."
"As a Polish Member of the European Parliament, I would like to offer sincere thanks to the Members of this House who helped and supported us in those difficult times."
"Representatives of all the political groups were involved."
"I believe the help and support provided by other Belarussians who share the same fate as Poles in Belarus was equally important."
"In particular, I should like to thank representatives of the Belarussian opposition for their support of the Union of Poles in Belarus at this difficult time."
"It points to the emergence of a network of solidarity in Europe."
"This network enables people who often needed help themselves in the past to support those who are currently in difficulty."
"In my view, the European Commission should also be congratulated on the matter referred to by the Commissioner, that is, on the first signs of a review of the European Union’s policy towards Belarus."
"These are good signs, and I trust the good work will be kept up."
"Mr President, events in Belarus do not concern just a limited number of Member States, such as Poland or the Baltic States, because of obvious historical, political, geographic and social reasons."
"These events should be of concern to each and every Member State here."
"This is one of the deficiencies in our approach: not all of us consider Belarus as our backyard issue, as indeed it is."
"I will not be repeating what has been said."
"Instead, allow me to register the fact that significant progress has been registered since the last time we met and tackled this subject in this Chamber."
"As you said, Commissioner, the Commission is opening a representative office in Minsk and a broadcasting project is kicking off, even though some of us are not that happy with the way it is being tackled – and they may be right."
"Nevertheless, this is a first step on which we have long been insisting and the Commission should be commended for having kept its word."
"But we must not stop here."
"The statements made by the country's President during the United Nations Summit are not a good omen."
"Some of our colleagues are still in prison – I mention Mikola Statkevich as a symbol for them all."
"I hope that this interest in Belarus will not wane, as political appointments in certain Member States come and go."
"The situation in Belarus is too delicate to be used as a political football."
"It should be a long-term commitment – and, let us hope, not that long-term; let us hope that the situation is solved in the medium term."
"But it should be a commitment of the European Union."
". Mr President, Belarus is an anomaly on the European continent."
"It is governed by an individual who has himself declared the Soviet Union to be his homeland, and who regrets the disappearance of that wonderful country from the map of Europe."
"This individual is attempting to cut Belarus off from Europe."
"He is clearly afraid of the wind of freedom that swept through Europe precisely as a result of Solidarity’s activities."
"I think it would be extremely important to ensure that as Mr Lukaszenko introduces charges for crossing the border, the Member States of the Union start to issue free visas to Belarussians, thus making it abundantly clear that Europe is not turning its back on Belarus as its leader maintains."
"It is not simply a matter of gestures of this nature. Activities in Belarus need to be supported also."
"I was delighted to hear the Commissioner say that the European Commission is launching programmes for Belarus, but I am distressed that all this has taken so long."
"After all, the year is drawing to a close."
"I understand that there were technical obstacles to overcome."
"If these are permanent obstacles, it seems to me that there is a will in this House to cut through bureaucratic red tape and help the Commission to act efficiently and effectively."
"If we fail to do so and do not help Belarus, then not only will Belarus be a stain on the map of Europe but it will also be a stain on our consciences."
"Europe needs to be synonymous with freedom, and that means freedom for Belarus too."
". – Mr President, we are united in our criticism of the alarming development in our neighbouring country."
"A dictatorship with no respect for human rights or for democracy is being systematically installed before our eyes."
"This convergence of views even extends to the Commission and the Council."
"We must finally take action and use all means at our disposal to promote democracy and pluralism in Belarus."
"Those were Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s words."
"I am not, however, satisfied with what has been done to date."
"The Commission has left the Polish/Baltic/Ukrainian initiative out in the cold."
"There is a very tricky danger on the eastern border, tensions among the neighbouring states, and no common foreign policy."
"Civil society, the only source of democratic potential and of hope in that country, is not receiving sufficient support."
"What the Commissioner has proposed up to now is insufficient."
"Our repertoire of diplomatic protests has been far from exhausted."
"The use of sanctions should be much more modulated and targeted."
"Talk is not enough."
"There must be much more financial support for civil society."
"I call on the Commissioner to develop a special programme and to hasten to sit down at the table with the Council, so that genuinely coherent political, financial and economic measures can be taken and thus 2006 can see the beginnings of democracy in Belarus."
"Mr President, I wish to concur with the sharp criticism of the Lukashenko regime heard in the Chamber this evening."
"We have seen a serious deterioration in an already bad situation in Belarus, and the regime is now, more and more, showing the classic characteristics of a political dictatorship."
"I am, in general, able to agree with all the positions put forward in the resolution, but I believe that one area could be developed further, namely the significance of the independent trade union movement in Belarus."
"Independent trade unions have been among the key organisers of the opposition to the Lukashenko regime, but they are now fighting for their survival and existence under the tyranny."
"There is a great deal of cooperation between trade unions in other EU countries, for example Sweden, and independent trade unions in Belarus."
"I hope that they will be informed about the EU’s support for the democratic opposition."
"We have been reminded this week of the significance of Solidarity in Poland, and it is of course important to have a strong and independent trade union movement in order to achieve the changes required in Belarus."
". Mr President, 11 years ago, immediately following his assumption of office, President Alexander Lukashenko made a significant pledge to his Belarussian electorate."
"He said he would revive the Soviet Union."
"Lukashenko has delivered on his promise."
"The historic white-red-white Belarussian flag is banned and Russian is the official national language."
"This absurd antinational policy has now reached its nadir with the existence, in Minsk, of an underground lyceum, which is the only secondary school left in the country in which lessons are still taught in the mother tongue, until such time, that is, as the secret service tracks down the private dwellings that also function as classrooms these days."
"Against this background, I support the Commission’s initiative to contribute financially to independent radio transmissions for Belarus. In fact, that is what the Polish Government is already doing."
"Brussels would do well to take a leaf out of their book."
"Not only do the Poles earmark considerably more funds, but their programmes will also start straightaway in Belarussian this autumn."
"Meanwhile, the drastically deteriorated relation between Lukashenko’s Belarus and the three eastern EU Member States – Poland, Lithuania and Latvia – must be weighing heavily on the Commission."
"The oppressive regime in Minsk even acts as if a NATO intervention were underway. This may result in a small border conflict."
"The major security risks for the European Union of 25 inherent in this prompt me to address a few questions to the Commission."
"What does it make of the initiative by Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Ukraine to coordinate their politics in respect of Belarus?"
"Has the Commission taken steps to persuade Russia to shoulder its responsibility as President of the G8 and make a positive contribution to reducing the tensions caused by Lukashenko’s domestic and foreign policy?"
"I would ask you Commissioner, as you are replacing Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to pass on those questions that are, after all, essential to the EU’s security policy, not least in view of the CFSP."
"I look forward to an answer."
"I have gathered from church contacts in my own country and scientific information from Germany that fellow citizens in the EU Member States ..."
". Mr President, violations of human rights are an everyday occurrence in Belarus."
"The latest in the long list of such violations was the nationalistic hounding of Poles, culminating in the Union of Poles in Belarus being declared illegal and its activists persecuted."
"There is a lot of ground to cover, but this does not mean that we should be content with a ‘softly softly’ approach."
"On the contrary, we should drive forward relentlessly in our dealings with Belarus."
"If we are not to revisit the issue of violations of human rights in Belarus on a weekly basis, a permanent rapporteur for Belarus on the Commission’s side is needed."
"So too is an effective method of funding the democratic forces, and it is hard to envisage how such support could be offered without a specific instrument devoted to human rights."
"This instrument should be as flexible, fast and effective as possible concerning the provision of support in unfavourable legal circumstances."
"The fact that we are holding yet another debate on Belarus testifies to the weakness demonstrated by Parliament and the European Union in this regard."
"This is the fifth time Belarus has been on our agenda, yet we have still not succeeded in prioritising the issue and making it a condition of the development of good relations between the European Union and Russia."
"It is true that the European Commission has been promising more and more, but it is still dragging its feet and acting reluctantly, slowly and passively where Belarus is concerned."
"As a result, the European Union’s credibility in this area has been compromised."
"I would simply like to point out that even the administrative procedures adopted by the quasi-grotesque regime in Minsk have proved more efficient and effective than ours in the case of radio broadcasts."
"Belarus is broadcasting to the European Union, but from our side there is nothing but a deafening silence."
"I should like to conclude with a more general observation, namely that Europe has cast itself in such a ridiculous light with regard to Belarus that it has rendered its declaration on the Union’s common foreign policy completely meaningless."
"– Mr President, this House has already occupied itself with Belarus repeatedly in the past, but it was only a small minority that did so: Mrs Schroedter, my colleague Mr Gahler and a few others."
"I am pleased that we are now working actively on this important issue."
"This is due to our Polish fellow Members, in particular, and I should like to thank them explicitly for this."
"It shows that history has an impact."
"There have been negative, nationalistic eras in history, but also repeated positive examples of coexistence."
"One such example was the coexistence of Poles, Lithuanians and Belarussians in a federation in the Middle Ages."
"That was Europe in miniature, and that Europe has repercussions today, in that we and our Polish fellow Members are all supporting not just the Polish minority in Belarus, but the Belarussian people as a whole; a people which is suffering oppression on a massive scale and which is unfortunately also threatened with attempts to restore the Soviet Union in one form or another."
"Such attempts are absurd and doomed to failure but, as we know, these ideas are being toyed with further east."
"It is in the fundamental interests of the European Union, therefore, to give our neighbour Belarus and its people and civil society, much greater support than we have been doing and, in particular, to ensure that media freedom is pushed through."
"I should also like to criticise in no uncertain terms the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, which broadcasts its programmes in that important European country in Russian: that is to say, in the language of the colonial power that oppressed Belarus for many years and shares responsibility for the situation now prevailing there."
"It is the right of the Belarussian people to be respected as a unique European culture, and this should also be reflected in the media promoted by the European Union."
"This culture forms an important part of the community of the European peoples."
"Mr President, the Internet has become one of the main sources of independent information in Belarus over the last few years."
"The number of home computers and Internet connections is increasing."
"In mid-2005, 2 million people in Belarus were connected to the Internet out of a population of 10 million."
"Almost 450 000 individuals used Internet Cafés in Minsk in 2004."
"At the same time, however, the state firm Beltelecom which is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Communications, continues to hold a monopoly over Internet connections."
"Mr Lukashenko’s regime is doing its best to control use of the Internet by civil society."
"It is also persecuting and oppressing individuals active in cyberspace, invoking undemocratic articles of the criminal code for the purpose."
"The European Union should be exploiting the most modern means of communication as it strives to promote human rights in Belarus."
"The role of the Internet in providing independent information should be the same as that of the radio in overthrowing dictatorships in the 20th century."
"The Union must increase the funding devoted to exploiting those new forms of communication through the Internet and mobile telephony that could serve the interests of Belarussian civil society."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, we all have experience of unhealed wounds and injustices that may define the present-day situation for us."
"This also applies to Belarus."
"We should therefore bear three things in mind."
"We should try to gain an objective understanding of the situation in the country, or in other words avoid picking and choosing our sources of information, and instead try not to ignore anything that does not fit in with a black-and-white view of Belarus."
"We should also not exclude anyone from discussions, even if we do not necessarily always agree with their views."
"Finally, Belarus is not merely Lukashenko, or vice versa."
"EU policy should strive to improve the situation of the country and its people."
"I do not take the side of Lukashenko’s government, nor do I support its abject failures, but I would like to warn that a policy of force using sanctions, demonisation of the regime’s representatives and propagandistic simplification of the problem usually only serves to escalate the situation, and resolves nothing."
"Mr President, the harassment and persecution endured by the Polish minority in Belarus are widely known."
"The 1995 Council of Europe framework convention on the protection of national minorities is being systematically and brutally infringed as regards the Union of Poles in Belarus and also other minorities such as the Roma."
"All this is happening in a European country located just across the Union’s external border."
"The European Parliament traditionally and quite rightly responds to violations of human rights, including the rights of national minorities in different parts of the world."
"Parliament cannot therefore remain indifferent to events in Belarus."
"The Independence and Democracy Group supports the draft joint resolution, especially concerning the situation of Poles in Belarus."
"I therefore call for priority to be given to supporting the Union of Poles in Belarus and its legitimate leaders."
"Aid should be channelled primarily through Polish bordering regions."
"It should be clearly understood that the key to a genuine solution to most of the problems in Belarus is not actually held by Mr Lukashenko, but by his Russian godfather Mr Putin, a former KGB officer."
"Mr Putin and Mr Lukashenko both resort to the methods of the secret services of the former Communist regime."
"The European Parliament would do well to keep this in mind."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union’s policy to date in relation to the Lukashenko regime has been completely spineless."
"The European Commission does not have an adequate action plan to foster the development of democracy in practice."
"Occasionally it seems that, as far as the Commission is concerned, Belarus does not exist – it simply is not there."
"The coordination of action and information between European Union institutions, the Council of Europe and the United Nations is totally inadequate."
"The democratic forces in Belarus are currently totally fragmented."
"I would like to call on the Commission to draft an action plan to bring the forces of democracy together."
"Similarly, the Commission must continue to demand the immediate release of Mihail Marinich, the opposition leader who was convicted on political grounds."
"In relation to setting up an independent broadcasting station for Belarus, I would like to draw attention to two matters."
"Firstly, I would like to express my extreme disappointment at the fact that, because of the conditions of the competition that has been announced, the broadcasting organisations of the Baltic States and Poland cannot in practice participate."
"They cannot even take part in a consortium."
"However, it is precisely these neighbours of Belarus who have the greatest expertise regarding the processes taking place in that country."
"Secondly, broadcasts must be primarily in Belarussian, as Mr Posselt has already mentioned, so that the population can perceive them as their own."
"The fact that many people in Belarus know Russian better, and do not know Belarussian, is a direct consequence of Russification."
"That is a process we should not encourage."
"Mr President, the opposition parties, non-governmental organisations and national and religious minorities in Belarus are all eagerly awaiting the impact of the action by the European Commission and by the Council."
"This impact remains to be felt, however."
"Funds from the European Initiative for Democracy have yet to be allocated."
"The solidarity fund for families of oppressed politicians is still under discussion."
"The Venice Commission has not been requested to conduct an international study on the validity of the referendum enabling President Lukashenko to continue exercising totalitarian rule for further terms in office."
"No European office has yet opened in Minsk, although the Belarussian Government’s mission is active in Brussels."
"Individuals who have oppressed non-governmental organisations, minorities and the Protestant churches are able to travel freely across Europe, because the visa sanctions only apply to a couple of them."
"I therefore urge the Commission to be more proactive and to display more commitment to these issues."
"I suggest drawing up a report on the situation in Belarus in conjunction with hearings and in-depth research, with a view to drafting a plan for the Union’s dealings with Belarus in the short and long term."
"This report would also be useful in establishing needs and threats, and the resources and types of action the European Union and the Member States should take."
"Such action must be undertaken in a cohesive and synchronised manner for it to have any chance of success, however."
"Mr President, Commissioner, how many more dictatorships have to collapse, and how many more dissidents have to suffer death or the ruination of their health in prison, before dismal dictators like Mr Castro or Mr Lukashenko understand the harm they are doing to their nations?"
"How much longer must dissidents continue to be hounded for their convictions, defending fundamental human rights and standing up for freedom and justice?"
"All citizens of the free world and especially those of us who come from the part of Europe that endured Communism’s iron rule, have a special calling to combat totalitarianism and contempt for human rights."
"That is why I very much hope that the European Commission and the European Council will stand shoulder to shoulder with us and help us in our struggle."
"Commissioner, whilst I am grateful for the action taken to date, I feel the time has come to adopt a more determined stance."
"How much longer can we tolerate the fundamental values on which the European Union is founded being held in such contempt in Belarus, a country with which the Union has a common border?"
"Sooner or later dictators fall, leaving devastation behind them."
"I refer to fractured and terrorised societies where individuals lack a spirit of independence and belief in their own worth."
"We need to help the people of Belarus to topple Mr Lukashenko, and we should also help them to lay the foundations for a free civil society and educate the younger generation."
"We should support the democratic opposition in Belarus and condemn violations of citizens’ freedoms and human rights."
"The Commission ought to support Belarussian culture, of which the Belarussian language is a part."
"It would therefore be a mistake to support radio and television broadcasts in Russian."
"We should not be party to the russification of Belarus, as ordered by Mr Lukashenko."
"European funds should be devoted to radio and television broadcasts in the Belarussian language."
"I would like to point out to the Commission that such broadcasts already exist."
"Broadcasts in Belarussian from radio and television stations in Poland are being received in Belarus, and this work deserves support."
"Similarly, support should be given to the proposed radio station to be set up by free Belarussians in Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine to broadcast to Belarus."
"Those of us who hail from Central Europe remember well what a beacon of hope Radio Free Europe was for us."
"Europe will always be a beacon of freedom, and I therefore call for a Radio Free Belarus to be set up."
". Mr President, I thank you for your substantive and serious interventions in this debate concerning Belarus and the state of its democracy and human rights."
"I take note of the points raised and will pass them on so that we can digest them seriously."
"I would also like to thank you for your support for the Commission's work, including the opening of the Commission office in Minsk."
"As Mr Onyszkiewicz said, we cannot fail Belarus; we cannot ignore it."
"I agree with the various speakers who are very concerned about the road Belarus is still taking."
"I am also very concerned about the lack of focus on a strategic interest of Europe, something which is all too common today."
"We should not, in our ongoing existential reflection, neglect the question as to how we can best enhance a stable zone of liberty and democracy in our south-eastern and eastern neighbourhood, be it for instance Turkey or the Western Balkans, Ukraine or Belarus."
"This implies, inter alia, that we use to the maximum and further develop the policy tools that are available under the European neighbourhood policy."
"There were some specific questions addressed to the Commissioner, and as I have said, I have passed them on to our services."
"However, I would like to make a point concerning the language question."
"Why do we support broadcasting in both Russian and Belarussian?"
"There is one simple fact which we have to take into account: 65% of the Belarussian population speaks Russian at home, while 5% speak Belarussian at home."
"In order to get our message across, we have to take into account the fact that the majority of the Belarussian population speaks Russian at home."
"This is precisely why we have opted for broadcasting in both languages, Russian and Belarussian: Russian for pragmatic reasons – that is what most people speak every day;"
"The voice of the European Parliament and its support for our initiative adds tremendous weight to the European Union's efforts to push for greater democratisation and respect for human rights in Belarus."
"This has never been more essential than today, in the run-up to the elections, which if fairly conducted could be a turning point in the country's destiny."
"Thank you, Mr Rehn."
"At the close of this debate I have received seven draft resolutions tabled under Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure(1)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the draft resolutions will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"– Thank you, Mr President."
"I speak on behalf of the New Italian Socialist Party."
"All too often recently, this Parliament has found itself debating the behaviour of the Belarussian Government, the last bastion of Communist authoritarianism in our continent."
"President Lukashenko is continuing his illiberal policy by stifling the voices of a great many, mostly young people, who are demanding a future of freedom for their country."
"Some fundamental rights of the individual are being constantly and deliberately denied by central government, which is instead tightening its grip and preventing citizens from freely expressing their thoughts, their political beliefs and their faith."
"Minorities in the country do not enjoy adequate protection but instead are often subjected to abuse and discrimination."
"It is intolerable that all this is happening on our doorstep."
"While we support President Barroso’s approach, we believe that efforts should be stepped up to increase the European Union’s presence in Minsk: to distribute information, carry out coordination and support activities, and monitor the situation, particularly regarding human rights."
"Europe needs to have the ability and strength to take effective political action, not least through closer cooperation with the opposition political forces in the country, who, with growing support from the people, are fighting to ensure a different and better future for Belarus."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A6-0256/2005) by Emilio Menéndez del Valle on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs on EU-India relations: a strategic partnership [2004/2169(INI)]."
". Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the Members from the different political groups whose amendments have contributed to improving my report, as well as the Committee on Development and the Committee on International Trade for their opinions and, of course, the officials of this House, whose work has ensured its success."
"My starting point was the Commission’s Communication on a strategic partnership between the European Union and India, of June 2004, and the excellent and well-researched response of the Indian Government in its strategic document of August of the same year."
"I have taken account of the various meetings held since then by Indians and Europeans and, of course, the 5th bilateral Summit in The Hague, of November of last year, the cornerstone that officially launched the strategic partnership and which accords India the status of privileged partner, similar to that granted to other important countries."
"Finally, where possible, I followed the preparations and meetings prior to the 6th bilateral Summit in New Delhi, on 7 September of this year, which gave the green light to the expected joint action plan of the strategic partnership."
"I believe that, in certain areas of the report, I am going further than the Commission and the Council and there can sometimes be a degree of disagreement between my position and theirs, though more because of omissions rather than concrete actions on their part."
"Nevertheless, I believe that, if my report is approved during tomorrow’s sitting, we will be justified in saying that the three Institutions mentioned – Parliament, Commission and Council – fully share the desire to promote, consolidate and enrich our relationship with the largest democracy in the world, in a manner that benefits both parties mutually."
"We cannot forget that we are talking about a country, India, which is in fact the largest democracy in the world."
"Furthermore, it is worth pointing out, as I do in the text, that some of the objectives indicated in the Council’s Communication and in the recent joint action plan require specific funding which, if we are serious in our intentions, we must not avoid."
"Otherwise there will be little point to any political dialogue."
"In this chapter, I propose that Parliament express its support for the strategic partnership prioritising political dialogue, although I would stress that the achievement of the Millennium Objectives and the effective fight against poverty must continue to be the central elements of the Union’s strategic commitment to India."
"The latter is in itself a political act, because without the political will to approve the appropriate financial resources, no development objectives can be achieved."
"India is faced with the task of completing the great development project that is already underway. I am working on the basis that she and the Union share the view that trade, investment and free competition are key factors for development, but also that, in order for this to be harmonious and equitable, fundamental social requirements must be taken into account which strengthen economic and social cohesion, the environment and the rights of consumers."
"I would therefore like to call upon New Delhi to deal rigorously with these factors."
"The day before yesterday – I would like to tell you – the editorial of an influential British daily newspaper said that the honeymoon between the Indian Government and the private economic-financial sector is over and it accused the Indian Government of having allowed the leftist allies – and I quote – of the governmental coalition to block the promised reforms."
"In spite of this, the daily newspaper explicitly recognises that the Indian economy has the wind behind its sails, growth may exceed 7% this year, business profits are increasing, the information technology sector is growing in strength, the stock exchange is buoyant and huge amounts of capital are still pouring in – end of quote."
"Nevertheless – according to that newspaper – the Indian Government cannot take credit for any of these achievements, which are due – it says – purely to good luck, past reforms and the efforts of the private sector."
"I quite frankly believe that that influential daily newspaper is being fanciful."
"I did not know that good luck was an active determining factor for the economy."
"The fact is – and I shall end here – that India is making progress, as is its strategic relationship with the Union."
"My five-minute speech has no room for any more."
"My intentions are laid out in detail in the Explanatory Statement and in the Motion for a Resolution."
"I would simply like to remind the Indian Government and society of certain issues such as the following: the death penalty must be abolished, the United Nations Convention against Torture must be ratified, it must sign up to the International Criminal Court and it would also be a good idea to sign up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as should Pakistan and Israel, by the way."
". Mr President, I would like to pay a warm tribute to Mr Menéndez del Valle for his excellent report on the EU-India strategic partnership which will serve as a very useful stimulus to the policy of the European Union in this field."
"There is much food for thought in this report for us to digest."
"The rapid emergence of India and its impact on the world scene is a phenomenon of tremendous importance."
"As the new India defines itself economically and politically, the rest of the world, including Europe, must adjust its own vision of this country."
"Europe has clearly indicated that we take India very seriously."
"The last EU-India summit held two weeks ago endorsed an ambitious joint action plan which provides the framework for a qualitative transformation in the way we engage with India."
"This action plan paves the way for closer cooperation on shared strategic goals for the development of trade and investment in enhanced cultural cooperation, participation in Galileo and even foresees India's participation in ITER."
"This action plan provides a roadmap for the concrete implementation of our strategic partnership."
"We noted the emphasis in the report on the fact that the EU and India, as the largest democracies in the world, share a commitment to values which contribute to global peace and stability."
"We share fundamental values, be it our commitment to democracy and human rights or a joint attachment to institutions of global governance."
"The new India sometimes seems like one world in a single country."
"It combines first-class capabilities in information technology, pharmaceuticals and biotech with Third World levels of poverty."
"Indians buy 2 million mobile phones a month, but 300 million Indians still live on less than a dollar a day."
"The Commission shares the view eloquently expressed in the report by Mr Menéndez del Valle that open trade and increased inward investment are key factors in economic development, but that if such development is to be harmonious, sustainable and equitable it must take into account fundamental social needs."
"Finally, the Commission is determined to support India's course of economic reform and modernisation."
"Our regulatory dialogue, student exchanges and scientific cooperation will all serve to underpin ongoing reform."
"Our relationship with India cannot be built only through bilateral cooperation."
"We must look forward to working closely with India to make the Hong Kong WTO Ministerial Meeting a success."
"The EU and India must show leadership in bringing the Doha Development Agenda to a successful conclusion and indeed India, as our partner, is in a unique position to make a case for open trade in goods and services as a powerful tool of development."
". – Mr President, strategic relations between the European Union and India, especially the recent joint action plan, mark a shift in cooperation to higher and more stable levels."
"I consider it positive that the new cooperation framework is not a compilation of individual objectives and means, but reflects an overall approach based on equality and reciprocity."
"The dynamics of cooperation and the anticipated benefits for both sides alone are sufficient to justify the new endeavour."
"However, we also need to give an important position to the dissemination of the product of bilateral cooperation in the area of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, in which India plays a central role, and within the framework of the global trade system."
"As draftsman of the opinion and focusing on the pillar of the economic dimension, especially trade, I wish to observe that the challenge is to further strengthen trade and investment flows."
"Greater opening of the Indian market, which will be beneficial to India itself, economic reforms, which will demonstrate systematic convergence and support for teams in the sector of science and technology are creative meeting grounds for both sides."
"An eminent opportunity for constructive cooperation, as you yourself said Commissioner, is without doubt the current WTO round, the Doha round."
"Finally, I trust that the particular weight which India has at G20 will take on the characteristics of a fruitful and creative contribution to bridging the positions between the developed and the developing countries."
"My warm congratulations to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament will benefit greatly from the work done by the rapporteur and those Members who have devoted themselves over recent months to the topic of cooperation with India."
"We are moving towards a strategic partnership that we hope the Commission and also the European Council will formally consolidate, while we, as the European Parliament, must strongly demand an active role in the area of cooperation with the Indian Parliament."
"The rapporteur, Mr Menéndez del Valle, has produced an excellent report which, however, requires the ongoing commitment of the European Parliament."
"The document that we will put to the vote tomorrow is extremely analytical and examines in depth a great many aspects of cooperation between the European Union and India."
"We are the two largest democracies in the world, working together to promote development and cooperation not only in the economic sphere but also in the social sphere, in order to guarantee a worldwide balance."
"These two leading powers must form an alliance to guarantee the rule of law, human rights and – I must stress this – the need to protect workers’ rights."
"That is why, if we want to commit ourselves alongside India to achieving a new balance for peace and development in any shape or form, it is vital that an interparliamentary delegation between the EU and India should be created, that there should be annual meetings between the two parliaments and, in short, that in practical terms our Parliament should guarantee its ongoing commitment to all the items called for in the directive on which we shall vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Menéndez del Valle on his excellent work."
"As chairman of Parliament's delegation covering India, I believe his report is balanced and demonstrates the complex and valuable relationship between the EU and India."
"It also marks a real turning point in our long-shared history."
"The EU and India are natural partners and, as we have heard several times today, two of the largest democracies in the world."
"In a few decades India will be one of the largest economies in the world."
"It possesses immense geopolitical strength and it is timely for us to shift our relationship to a higher and a more intensive level."
"Both the partners are well placed to be significant players in the global, knowledge-based economy."
"In the words of Tony Blair, it is crucial for the EU and India to create an equal partnership for mutual benefit, especially with our own declining demographic trends and with half of India's population being under 25."
"However, while we often hear about India's highly-developed technical sector, it is important not to forget that there are still huge challenges in India where we could play a pivotal role: poverty and deprivation and over 600 million people reliant on farming."
"That is why our response needs to be more than just rhetoric."
"I support what Mr Menéndez del Valle said about needing more resources."
"The Commission and the Council need to seriously address the request for India for EUR 1 billion each for health and education, recognising that one of our main priorities is the Millennium Development Goals and India makes up 40% of the MDGs."
"At the same time, the Commission needs to have progressive aid policies that stimulate the entire country and not just certain regions."
"Beyond all the warm words, how do we make a difference?"
"Our partnership needs to reach beyond economics, to be more political."
"We cannot talk about an increasing political dialogue but then set up only a high-level trade group."
"There is an urgent need to create and upgrade our contacts between parliaments."
"I really welcome the forum of parliamentarians set up by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, but both sides need to adopt a roadmap for enhanced political dialogue, including parliamentary support."
". Mr President, globalisation is a challenge for the world's established economies."
"In Europe, we must ensure that we establish stronger ties with countries that share our values."
"The proposed EU-India Strategic Partnership therefore represents an opportunity for both the EU and India and has the potential to have a positive effect on the whole of the South-East Asian region."
"Whilst it is all too easy to see this partnership in purely economic terms, to my mind it represents much more than this."
"Clearly, India is one of the nations at the forefront of the economic emergence of Asia."
"In India, we also see a country that has our shared values of democracy, the rule of law, an independent judiciary and free media."
"There is still much work to do, but all of these factors allow investors to have confidence in their dealings with India and should instil in us the confidence to take these steps towards partnership."
"Within this partnership there will also be scope to raise issues in other areas, whether this be on human rights, child labour, education, development, poverty eradication, women's rights or the rights of minorities."
"There must always be a willingness to raise these issues with our partners, but always to do so on the basis of equality in exchange for mutual benefit."
"India is a nation rich in culture and history."
"Its history is intertwined inseparably with European history."
"These shared experiences provide a solid foundation from which we can build."
"The growing importance India has in South-East Asia places upon it extra responsibilities."
"There will be times when we learn from India's experience, but equally, at other junctures, we should be willing to provide our opinion and support to ensure that these responsibilities are fulfilled."
"It is only by doing so that we can truly give our sincere commitment to the partnership."
"In our global village, South-East Asia represents an area of great opportunity and it is here that our relations with India can help bring about peace, stability and closer cooperation between the South-East Asian nations."
"They, of course, have their issues, whether it be water or self-determination, but there remains here a distinct possibility that South-East Asia could emerge as a closer union."
". Mr President, having worked a 13-hour day, I will soon be contravening the Working Time Directive."
"I am on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, so perhaps I will report to the chairman, but I will cope, which is more than millions of people in the Indian sub-continent can say."
"Here we have the astonishing spectacle of the EU pouring funds into the three SEI organisations, relocating thousands of jobs in the call centre software services sector to India, just part of the relocation of so many jobs to Asia."
"That it makes European unemployment worse is not the point."
"What is relevant is the reason for the job relocation."
"We all know why: cheaper products, primarily because workers in that part of the world are paid less than European workers, which means less than the legal minimum European rate."
"If that is not the case, there is no reason to relocate in the first place."
"They will also have longer working hours, actually promoted by three SEIs."
"Mr Menéndez del Valle actually boasts of up to five-and-a-half hours more per day available."
"Worse, he admits to unemployment abuses in India, including child labour."
"So we have cheaper products by breaking EU rules for wages and for the hours worked by employees who, I have no doubt, are often working in circumstances which an EU health and safety inspector would shut down."
"In short, the EU is exploiting sweated labour, the same evil practice it is so keen to eradicate here."
"What a disgrace!"
"Mr President, the strategic partnership between the Union and India can be described in very simple terms."
"It is a partnership between democrats."
"The Union and India are the two largest democracies in the world, as has already been stated in the House."
"Of course, democracy on the Indian sub-continent is rooted in specific traditions and value systems but it is democracy nonetheless."
"India is one of the most densely populated countries in the world, and also an emerging economic power."
"It already has observer status at the G7."
"It is a country of paradoxes, as I was able to observe during the couple of weeks I spent there."
"On the one hand there is the very latest technological and computer equipment."
"On the other, as Mrs Gill mentioned earlier, over half a billion people live off farming and 370 million people, almost 35% of the population, live below the poverty threshold."
"We should also remember that between 17.5 and 35 million children have to work."
"In addition, India is a country that needs to import 70% of its energy from abroad, and is dependent on foreign support."
"We do not yet know whether India will be granted a permanent seat on the UN Security Council."
"It might not be appropriate to adjust the composition of that body, as doing so is bound to give rise to strong feelings in various European and non-European states."
"There is no doubt, however, that Delhi will soon be playing a leading role on the world political and economic stage."
"A strategic partnership between the Union and India is a necessary step in the right direction for both parties."
"We should not gloss over certain issues such as the as yet unresolved conflict in Kashmir or the fact that the latest round in the so-called cricket diplomacy between India and Pakistan does not take account of the wishes of the people of Kashmir."
"Above all, it is the people of Kashmir who should be consulted on the future of their region, not just the politicians in Karachi or Delhi."
"Important as it is, that consideration should not be allowed to detract from the fact that India needs the Union and the Union needs India."
"Mr President, one of my proudest achievements in this House was to co-found three years ago the informal intergroup, Friends of India."
