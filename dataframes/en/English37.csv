"Unfortunately, fear of distorting competition often hinders even rational action."
"For that reason, competition law should be interpreted more freely in the case of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This would mean, for example, that the Structural Funds could be used more effectively to prevent unemployment."
"The Northern Dimension is a major premise in the political field."
"The Commission has mainly focused on two issues: environmental protection and nuclear safety."
"We would like to extend this list."
"The Northern Dimension offers immense potential in the area of energy policy."
"The natural gas deposits in the Arctic Ocean will be of vital importance to the EU in the future."
"We should just ensure that the links that are to be built should, as far as possible, pass through EU territory."
"The Northern Dimension also offers immense scope for cooperation in the field of cultural and research policy and higher education."
"The ELDR is strongly in favour of reforming the Commission's administration and pruning bureaucracy."
"The importance of that was reflected in the debate on the Structural Funds."
"Administrative costs should be in reasonable proportion to the operating appropriations used."
"Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately, you have not had the opportunity yet - and I am pleased to give you this opportunity now - to reply to my earlier questions about the 500 new positions, the lack of manpower to monitor compliance with environmental legislation and also to the question of whether candidate countries should get the bureaucratic red-tape underway as early as 2003 to apply for Structural Funds so as to guarantee the highest possible level of implementation in 2004."
"My other question in this area, and also my concern, relates to small projects, to which Mrs Smet has already referred."
"Everyone will agree that tax money must be spent wisely."
"It is true that the evaluation of small projects requires a relatively great deal of manpower for relatively small amounts of money."
"However, these projects are often important, for example, for society in the developing countries."
"This is why I am hoping for a proposal from the Commission for such things as the transfer of more operational powers to the external offices, less bureaucracy, less stringent requirements and, for example, for parliamentary delegations to have political control over the choice of those projects."
"Is this a proposal that you will be looking to develop further?"
"Mr President, thank you for amending the list of speakers so that I could rise as well."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is very concerned about the fact that at the European Court of Justice, there continues to be a massive backlog of translation work."
"What does this mean in practice?"
"Let's assume that in a specific case, proceedings have ended and a judgment has been handed down."
"As the Court of Justice - unlike other Community institutions - does not publish its decisions until they are available in all the Community languages, the backlog of translations means that the finished judgments stay in a drawer at the ECJ for between one and two years until they can be published."
"This is an untenable situation, in my view."
"It is also increasingly viewed as a problem by the national courts in the Member States, since in the case of preliminary rulings, the proceedings in the European Court of Justice are merely interim proceedings in the successive stages of appeal through the national courts."
"This means that these two years do not complete the proceedings; these two years are in addition to the duration of proceedings in the Member State."
"We therefore call for adequate resources to be made available in order to bring this untenable situation to an end."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is also responsible for issues relating to the internal market and enlargement."
"We have always focussed particularly on the specific challenges facing the internal market as a result of enlargement, especially for border regions."
"We therefore fully endorse the amendments which aim to ensure that in line with last year's pledge, the funding for the pilot programme for SMEs is pegged at EUR 15 million."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as early as the part-session last May, I expressed my concerns during the debate following the presentation of the 2003 PDB about a budgetary procedure which was proving, yet again, to be utterly inadequate to meet the needs of our Union."
"In May, my criticism of the Commission was based on two considerations: the level of RALs and heading 5."
"In July, Parliament and the Council came to an agreement on heading 5 which rejects the Commission's request for more staff to deal with the challenges of enlargement in an attempt to balance the accounts."
"I would rather not return to the subject of the RALs because time is lacking and because none of us wishes to hear information which we know to be completely unviable financially but which, nevertheless, is produced year after year in the budgetary procedure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the risk of repeating myself, I have to say once again that all this is quite ridiculous."
"Here I am yet again, calling upon this House and, through this House, upon the Council and the Commission to give due consideration to the possibility of revising the financial perspective, which, on the basis of my relatively little experience, appears to be the only conceivable sensible and responsible political move we can make."
"Article 19 of the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement states clearly that the financial perspective can be revised on the proposal of the Commission in the event of unforeseen circumstances, and what could have been less foreseeable than the impending enlargement of the Union to include 25 Member States in 2004?"
"I must stress: over the next three years, up until 2006, we will have to establish the budget for a 25-Member-State Union according to a financial perspective calculated on the basis of the needs of a 21-Member-State Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, where is the sense in all this?"
"Why are we continuing along this absurd path?"
"My proposal is, therefore, as follows. After the December Council, which will have to establish which and how many States are to enter the European Union in time for the European elections in 2004, the Commission should present a proposal for revision of the financial perspective, a proposal which the two arms of the budgetary authority will have ample time to adopt - in accordance with Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement - before the start of the 2004 budgetary procedure."
"I feel that this is the only path we can take, the only path which, with due regard for budgetary rigour, will allow us to continue to do our job properly."
"I do not feel that the solutions hitherto adopted have yielded sufficiently positive results , and whereas, thus far, we have only had to explain them to citizens who are, at heart, well-disposed towards us, whereas, thus far, we have only had to uphold them before voters who are, paradoxically, almost more European than we are, in a few months we will have to explain them to people who have suffered just to be part of this Union and who will view us with an extremely critical, vigilant eye, with even closer scrutiny than the current Member States, to see whether or not we have done a good job."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when we see the Commission produce a proposal for which we in this Parliament have been fighting, such as the creation of a solidarity fund for communities affected by natural disasters, we must of course offer our most sincere congratulations."
"Some items in this proposal, however, are somewhat confusing, and I should like the Commissioner to clarify them."
"Firstly, why did the Commission decide to extend the coverage of this type of disaster in its proposal, to disasters of an environmental and technological nature?"
"Secondly, the Structural Fund must under no circumstances be confused with this solidarity fund."
"This makes it hard to see on what basis the Structural Funds fall under this regulation."
"Would a general rule that cautioned against the dual use of the solidarity fund with measures already funded by any other instrument not suffice?"
"Thirdly, the reference to absolute costs of disasters makes no sense, because this of course most benefits the large economies and, furthermore, it is hard to understand why no reference is made to the financial capacity of each State as a criterion for the aid to be granted by the Community."
"Lastly and most crucially, we fail to understand why the regulation gives no consideration to a clear typology for the situation of outermost regions that have been most badly affected by natural disasters and I would ask the Commissioner how they can, in fact, be covered by this proposal."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me quickly run through just a few points regarding the 2003 budget procedure."
"Topic number one - since it occupied our minds yet again this week, as the President-in-Office can testify - is the European Union's aid to ameliorate the damage caused by the catastrophic floods in Europe."
"This House agreed what was really quite a good strategy a few weeks ago."
"Sadly, we have been unable to push this through in the negotiations with the Council."
"However, I have a specific request to the President-in-Office: please ensure that all the pledges you made to us yesterday in the trialogue, especially as regards the timetable, are upheld in practice."
"This would be unfair to the people and the victims of these floods."
"The PPE group's other idea has already been presented to you by the chairman of our working party, James Elles."
"I shall pick out just a few of the points here."
"Commissioner, I recall very clearly that at the start of its term in office, the Commission made various promises about all the things it wanted to do better, especially its plans to reform and improve the Commission's functions and working methods."
"Three years down the line, it is clear that this reforming zeal has now subsided somewhat."
"This being the case, it is down to Parliament to provide something of an incentive and motivate you to keep up the pace of reform."
"We therefore say 'yes' to additional posts, but initially in the reserve, and we expect a detailed timetable to be presented, showing how you intend to use your remaining two years in office to complete the reform of the Commission."
"This was what you promised three years ago, and alongside all the other matters which must be dealt with during your term in office, you must carry this through, for it was a key element of the mandate given to us by citizens at the 1999 European elections."
"In the area of the trans-European networks - to turn to my second topic - we would particularly like to ensure that the bottlenecks with the Central and Eastern European countries are removed."
"I therefore ask you, Commissioner, to devise proposals for the Member States which are directly affected as countries bordering the candidate countries, so that the resources from the budget lines can be used specifically to remove these bottlenecks."
"I think it is very important for enlargement to take place on a real and practical basis by establishing an appropriate cross-border infrastructure with the Central and Eastern European countries."
"Topic number three: let me briefly address the issue of the Palestinian Authority."
"We have tabled an amendment which states that funds should be put on reserve here."
"We want to ensure that European taxes are used in a proper manner."
"As yet, the International Monetary Fund has been unable to confirm that in terms of control of expenditure, it is doing all that we expect to be done as a matter of course when European funds are being used."
"Lastly, a key priority area for us is the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The President-in-Office is already aware of my request."
"It is rather depressing to hold a conciliation procedure at the end of July while everyone else was on holiday, only to find that the Council then fails to honour the agreements we made."
"I find this very disappointing."
"My request is that as set out in the statement adopted during the conciliation procedure, there will be 'appropriate involvement of the Parliament in respect of such matters under the CFSP'."
"We have tabled an amendment which is designed to point a way forward here, and I ask for your support."
"From next week, we will have to discuss in detail what we want to do during the 2003 budget procedure."
"The PPE is prepared to engage in constructive cooperation with the other groups."
"I hope that we will then be successful, through our joint efforts, in achieving progress on these important issues."
"Mr President, A-3021 - what is that all about?"
"In Volume IV, Section III - I have great understanding for Commissioners who have to deal in billions - we find budget heading A-3021: grants for European study groups and organisations advancing the idea of Europe."
"What a daft idea!"
"Why?"
"Because, I believe, it is symptomatic of the processes which result in many European citizens assuming that you have to have a friend who has a friend in order to get money out of Brussels."
"One of the previous speakers said that people think that the streets of Brussels are paved with cash."
"People who genuinely try it know that this is not the case, but that, if you do know the friend of a friend, you are getting close."
"Budget heading A-3021 bears ample witness to this."
"It lists some organisations but not others."
"An amendment by us, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which was intended to guarantee transparency by ensuring that the Commission applies the guidelines on assistance and subsidies and safeguards equal treatment of applicants and organisations, has been rejected."
"That is a tragedy."
"I wish this situation could be changed, for there can be no democracy without transparency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall start with the questions and statements from Mrs Gröner regarding the perusal of the budget. She asked how many measures are targeted directly at women and to what extent programmes include specific equality-oriented elements."
"Let me point out once again that we have taken this into account explicitly in many of the budget figures and included it explicitly in many of the programmes."
"You referred to 'gender budgeting' and I would like to take this up."
"Indeed, my plan for the future is that we will also use our own very precise rules, which we have established for the accounting process, to provide further answers here."
"It is the case, of course, that payments can only be made to a beneficiary if he or she is recorded in the appropriate register."
"Up to now, we still have no record of gender, but this is a step that should be taken."
"I hope that on International Women's Day next year, I will be able to report on progress here!"
"Now to the issue of staffing and personnel expenditure, which was just raised by Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Escobar."
"Firstly, with regard to Mrs Buitenweg's question concerning the proposed use of the additional posts for the year 2003, I can say that this is correct."
"These 500 posts that we have applied for are to be allocated entirely to preparations for enlargement."
"However, there are to be personnel increases for the other priorities too - such as sustainable development and security - and this should take place through reallocation of staff in-house, within and between the services."
"In line with the Commission's proposal, this means that we can then ensure, through administrative measures, that 149 posts can be made available additionally for the 'sustainable development' priority."
"For the area of environmental protection, together with the posts for enlargement, the proposal now provides for 33 more places for the Directorate-General."
"I think this shows very clearly, yet again, where the priorities are being set."
"As regards the use of the 717 posts which you approved for us in the last two years, the focus here has been on foreign policy."
"Almost 300 posts have been created in this area in order to improve implementation of the external assistance programmes."
"From the figures on implementation which are circulated to you each week, you can see that real and substantive improvements have been made here, with the 300 posts in this area having a clear impact."
"This is also apparent in other areas, such as competition etc."
"I would like to respond to Mr Virrankoski - and the appeal to improve the situation of SMEs came from several Members of this House - as follows: we have earmarked EUR 66 million specifically for this budget line, but SMEs can of course also secure funding via the Structural Funds and via loan programmes for which assistance is provided from various budget lines."
"Mr Würmeling, you called for appropriate resources for the European Court of Justice and drew specific attention to the fact that the European Court has to work in many different languages and that its judgments must also be translated into the relevant languages."
"There has been a strong increase in resources for the Court in recent years, thanks to the efforts of Mr Ferber, the rapporteur for this area, who has lobbied hard and very successfully for an increase in funding in recent years."
"Mr Turchi, you stated, in the context of enlargement, that there must be an adjustment of the financial perspective."
"This will indeed be our joint task for 2004 since the adjustment of the perspective must then be shaped in such as way as to ensure that we distribute the resources from category 8 appropriately to the other measures."
"After all, the negotiations on the enlargement budget are now well under way."
"The budget authority must then undertake the appropriate adjustment for the year 2004, so we will all be looking at this issue during the course of 2003."
"I would like to thank Mr Garriga Polledo once again for his comments on personnel."
"With regard to the reform of the Commission, we will of course be very pleased to submit a report to you again on progress made with regard to the implementation of the various measures agreed in the White Paper and which are supported by Parliament."
"The President-in-Office will doubtless make a statement on the disaster fund in a moment."
"However, I should like to reiterate that we are in an unusual situation here because the task is to create a completely new instrument."
"If we do succeed in establishing all the legal bases for this new instrument by the end of this October, this really will be a record performance."
"I think I have answered Mr Medina Ortega's questions in connection with the European Court of Justice."
"As regards the implementation of the various measures, I think we should also discuss the report on the Structural Funds in more detail in the Committee on Budgets."
"I would just point out that in 2002, we will not have the surplus which we had in 2001, since far more resources are being used in the area of agricultural policy than was the case last year, and also because my colleague Mr Fischler responded very quickly by adopting the measures necessary to provide prompt assistance to the regions where farmers suffered losses as a result of the floods, or to other areas."
"The EUR 900 million to be used for this mean that the budget surplus here will be lower."
"It will be lower in the structural policy field, and we will also be using part of the surplus to finance the disaster relief fund."
"Mr Casaca, you and other speakers this evening have raised this issue, and the President-in-Office will underline this once more in a moment: in the debate about the legal basis - in other words, when do we refer to a disaster, when will assistance be provided, and what conditions will apply - the President-in-Office has agreed that there will be a conciliation procedure in due course here too."
"There is just one further point to be mentioned: Mr Martin, you called for the subsidies to institutions which promote the European idea to be distributed in a different way so that there is no earmarking here."
"All I can say is that this is a decision for the European Parliament."
"The Commission has put forward a different proposal here."
"We will also have to decide on a legal basis, but in this respect, I interpret your appeal as a call to your colleagues in this House."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer."
"We now come to the reform of the agricultural policy."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see Commissioner Fischler here, but some of the comments I have to make will also refer to Commissioner Byrne's portfolio."
"I was astounded to read a letter in the Financial Times yesterday, from Hervé Gaymond, the French Agriculture Minister, and six other agriculture ministers."
"It was entitled 'The CAP is something to be proud of'."
"I was one of 400 000 countryside marchers in London on Sunday who would not agree."
"Subsidies have not delivered prosperity and security for British farmers; in fact, often subsidies and quotas are being capitalised into the high cost base of our industry."
"The letter reminded me of a drug addict in denial, addicted to subsidies."
"Rather than trying to kick the habit, they want to offer pills to the Eastern European countries waiting outside the school gates to get them hooked too."
"The CAP needs reform before enlargement, in particular, we should stop the hypocrisy of subsidising tobacco to the tune of over EUR 1 billion per year."
"The Environment Committee has also asked for 50% of the budget for the European Food Safety Authority to be put into the reserve."
"I hope this will be recognised by the Council as a clear signal that they should end the uncertainty about its location, which is making it so difficult for this embryonic institution to recruit staff and develop as an effective agency."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when we are debating the revision of the common fisheries policy, the budget for 2003 assumes particular importance, and so we hope that the Commission will provide the budgetary authority with information on the budgetary impact of the revision, as the Committee on Fisheries recommends in the opinion that it adopted for the Committee on Budgets."
"In any event, we must now guarantee the use of a flexibility instrument for the EUR 27 million that will be used to fund the specific measure of promoting the reconversion of the ships and fishermen that until 1999 depended on the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco, covered by the heading on the structural measures of the financial perspectives under heading B2-200 of the draft budget for 2003."
"In its opinion of 11 September on the budget for 2003, the Committee on Fisheries declared itself in favour of protecting the use of flexibility instrument for the PTE 27 billion for this funding, but as to the proposal to use the EUR 32 million for the funding of additional measures to destroy fishing boats in line with the Commission proposal on the revision of the common fisheries policy, the majority of Members of this House declared themselves against, since the entire issue is currently being debated and since the information we have is incomplete."
"The disagreement about any attempt to reprogramme or redistribute FIFG appropriations was also reaffirmed as was the principle that new means must be provided for new needs in order to protect the importance of the strategic sector of fisheries for the Community in general and for certain countries and regions in particular, given the deep-rooted link certain local and regional communities have with fishing."
"Other proposals crucial to the fisheries sector were also adopted, amongst which I would highlight the following: the creation of a Community support programme for coastal and small-scale fishing; increasing aid to the outermost regions; aid to aquiculture and to the processing industry, principally the canning industry; support for improving the monitoring of products that are placed on the market and support for improving and standardising control and monitoring systems and the increase in inspections and monitoring of fisheries activity."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, it is apparent yet again from today's discussion that some people are keen to feather their nests from the agricultural budget."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development - and I myself - do not believe that too much money is flowing into agriculture and Europe's rural regions."
"The money may not be flowing into the right channels, but that is why there is a need for reform."
"We therefore oppose linear cuts because we believe that what is required are not linear cuts but qualified measures."
"Of course, a key element in this context is to dispense with export subsidies in a region which is one of the largest importers in the world."
"We would like to see the option of a transfer from the first to the second pillar."
"To this end, it is essential that we have co-decision rights in respect of the obligatory expenditure as well."
"That is an urgent requirement."
"We have specifically adopted amendments which go beyond the Institutional Agreement because we want to force a new agreement and debate."
"Mr Fischler, these needs are also identified in your reform proposals."
"The financial perspective must be amended."
"We would therefore like to support this."
"We will undoubtedly get bogged down in discussions again later, but we think this is acceptable in principle."
"With regard to the transfer to the second pillar, let me point out again that we have re-introduced our INPART programme."
"The name has been changed."
"We are now calling it LEADER-EAST, since we have progressed further along the road to enlargement."
"However, we still endorse the concept of establishing a bottom-up programme for the new Member States as well."
"Finally, we would like genetic resources to be transferred to the non-obligatory part."
"You are familiar with the issues."
"I think that the Commission will go along with this."
"We simply have to try and find sufficient funds here."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to express my warm thanks to the honourable Members for making it possible, for the first time, for us to debate next year's budget in Parliament even before the formal procedure begins."
"As far as agriculture and rural development are concerned, I am pleased to see that a series of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development call for the appropriations in heading 1a to be restored to the level proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget, and that there is a desire to reverse the cuts made across the board by the Council."
"I explicitly welcome the reinstatement of these appropriations and should like in addition to underline that the Commission's PDB had already provided for a margin of EUR 2.26 billion below the financial perspective ceiling that was set in Berlin."
"As you know, at the end of October the Commission will be tabling a letter of amendment to the PDB for the EAGGF Guarantee Section so as to take account of the very latest macroeconomic forecasts and recent legislative developments."
"Today it is certainly still too early to quantify precisely the changes that could be proposed, but I can tell you which factors will be taken into consideration."
"Firstly, the devaluation of the US dollar compared with the euro will mean an increase in commitment appropriations, in particular for export refunds and some other payments."
"Secondly, the market situation in a number of sectors has unfortunately not improved since the preliminary draft budget was presented."
"This is the case in particular for milk and milk products, which is precisely the sector that has not yet undergone reform."
"Thirdly, and conversely, funds for direct payments in the arable crops sector will be cut in 2003."
"This follows on from the decisions we took in the summer in connection with the regions in Italy that were hit by severe drought and then the areas affected by the catastrophic flooding in Germany."
"In these cases, as you know, we have brought forward advance payments to the 2002 budget year and this is, after all, over EUR 900 million which will, as a result, no longer be needed in the 2003 budget."
"I would repeat, however, that this can only be a general indication of the content of the letter of amendment; it is too early to anticipate what it will say."
"For the purpose of the first reading of the draft budget the assumptions on the basis of which it was drawn up will obviously still apply."
"Allow me also briefly to address the question, which I am asked so frequently, of the extent to which the proposals made in the context of the mid-term review will impact on the 2003 budget."
"To be quite plain, not at all, because the mid-term review can only come into force in 2004 and no legislative changes will therefore be made in the coming year which will make it possible to change the budget."
"In its motion, the Agriculture Committee calls for funds to be made available to European farmers in compensation for the extreme weather conditions by, for example, using the surplus in the current marketing year or by creating a disaster relief fund in heading 1b."
"I have already mentioned that we have brought forward significant payments in the arable crops sector."
"This actually ought to have the effect of substantially reducing the anticipated margin in the current agriculture budget."
"As far as a disaster relief fund is concerned, the Commission has already proposed the creation of a solidarity fund, of at least EUR 500 million this year, but of EUR one billion in 2003, and a decision should be taken quickly on this."
"I would support the point made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that greater effort should be made to safeguard and improve the quality of agricultural products."
"However, this is not a matter that can be resolved in the context of the 2003 budget; it requires a longer-term strategy, the very strategy that we have set out in the mid-term review."
"It ought to be possible to achieve this in particular by changing the form and orientation of the support given to agriculture, for example by applying the principle of cross-compliance and by striking a better balance between the two pillars of the common agricultural policy."
"I should also like very briefly, since Mrs Figueiredo addressed this, to mention three issues in connection with fisheries policy."
"The first is the need to keep the budget for external fisheries policy, which mainly consists of estimated costs of fisheries protocols, at current levels."
"At its first reading, the Council retained the figures in the preliminary draft budget."
"This is also absolutely essential if the Community is to be able to continue its fishing activities in third countries."
"The letter of amendment in the autumn will go into more detail on how the funds are to be split between the budget line and the reserve."
"In this context, I also welcome the support for our external fisheries policy, and in particular the fisheries agreements, that was voiced by the rapporteurs of the Budgets and Fisheries Committees."
"The second issue is the payment of the second instalment to the Spanish and Portuguese fleets that used to fish in Moroccan waters."
"This is the EUR 27 million."
"The Commission made an initial proposal in its preliminary draft budget, but so far this has not received the support of the budgetary authority."
"For the time being, however, the Commission does not see any alternative to using the flexibility instrument either."
"The third issue is the impact of the reform on the budget, which will, by and large, be modest."
"The only proposal was to increase the scrapping fund by EUR 32 million."
"This would have an impact on the 2003 budget."
"The main problem with this fund is not its size but the budgetary framework."
"Here too the Commission has made a proposal in the letter of amendment to use the flexibility instrument."
"On the issues raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf in connection with export subsidies, I can only make proposals on the basis of existing legislation."
"I cannot work on the basis of possibilities that might arise at some point in the future."
"As far as codecision for compulsory expenditure is concerned, this question first needs to be referred to the Convention."
"It would require the Treaties to be amended accordingly."
"Only then would it be possible to meet your request, but I should like to stress that the Commission shares the view that in future, agricultural policy and fisheries policy should be included under the codecision procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, it is undoubtedly a great opportunity to take part in this new debate and also to take the floor under the sub-heading of reform of the common agricultural policy in the context of the 2003 budget."
"In my view - and this is a view shared by the majority of the Agriculture Committee - the 2003 budget, which is the subject of today's debate, is not the right context in which to discuss reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Neither is a debate assessing Commissioner Fischler's proposals on the mid-term review on today's agenda."
"Instead we should focus on the actual budgetary figures for the coming year and here there are two essential points which most definitely require a clear decision from us."
"Firstly, the Council is proposing a general reduction of 0.8% or 0.6% across all 1a lines, which amounts to a cut of EUR 275 million."
"Secondly, in the Agriculture Committee, our colleagues from the Greens proposed a drastic cut in export refunds; to be more precise they wanted to reduce all export refunds to zero."
"Neither of these proposals can be right today."
"It would send out the wrong signal."
"Accordingly, in a vote on a proposal tabled by the PPE Group, the Agriculture Committee rejected both proposals by a majority."
"I am quite happy - and this may be a perfectly sensible course of action - to consider moving funds from the first to the second pillar, but only in the context of a dedicated debate on the mid-term review and on a codecision basis."
"Every year, to the great delight of the Member States, huge sums of money flow back to them from the agriculture budget."
"At present, the utilisation rate of the 2002 agriculture budget lines is around 80%."
"The reality of the situation does indeed support the call for better management and optimal use of agricultural funds."
"To mention the example of export refunds once more, this is another area where a great deal more could be done."
"For these reasons we, along with the majority of the Committee on Agriculture, are against anticipating the results of the mid-term review."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, Commissioner Fischler, ladies and gentlemen, let me make it clear from the outset that on the whole we support the proposals on the mid-term review; even though they will not affect the 2003 budget, they appear to be the right steps in the right direction."
"Of course there are still a number of points that would merit further discussion."
"This is after all unquestionably a proposal for debate."
"What will be decisive for us, however, will also be the extent to which we will be able to transfer funds that have not been used in the first pillar to the second pillar in forthcoming budgets, and that also includes the 2003 budget, because the development of rural areas is something that we are of course all concerned about and it will certainly be an absolutely decisive factor in the future."
"The question is whether there is already any prospect now of going beyond the Interinstitutional Agreement and implementing this."
"A further question is of course: how much progress has been made with implementing the SAPARD programme, Commissioner?"
"What is the position with this LEADER-EAST programme, formerly known as INPART?"
"I should also like to mention this once more."
"It is also interesting for farmers to know - and you have only given vague hints about this in the mid-term review - what the future holds for the tobacco, sugar and milk sectors."
"What is going to happen about quotas in the milk sector?"
"This too is a very important question."
"As far as cofinancing is concerned, I should like to ask you to comment on this once more: this is an area where we certainly need greater flexibility."
"Mr President, stock exchanges have crashed, reversing the apparent miracle of the new economy and decimating workers' savings to the advantage of big business."
"Leaving aside for the moment the fact that it is inhumane, the threat of war with Iraq is pushing oil prices up and boosting inflationary pressures."
"Economic results, especially in the manufacturing sector, are disappointing to say the least."
"Capitalism is in a state of deep crisis; all it can do now is cling to the stability pact and anti-labour policies, chip away at workers' rights and their standard of living and pensions, cut farmers' incomes and choke the life out of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The European Union budget for 2003 is yet another example of this anti-grass roots policy in practice."
"Instead of redistributing any income, given that it accounts for less than 1.01% of Community GDP, it throws even more money at monopolies and at imperialist plans to suppress and exploit the people."
"A typical example is the agricultural economy: not only does the Community budget do nothing to reverse the decline in income of poor average farmers, who are being driven from the land in droves, but the system of prices and subsidies guarantees cheap raw materials and higher profits for the tobacco and other industries which process their products."
"The common agricultural policy and quotas have created a huge, EUR 25 billion trade deficit in the European Union, jobs are being lost and unemployment is rising."
"The objectives of big business for 2003 are obvious from the relative reduction in the amounts proposed, at a time when peoples' needs are increasing, unemployment is rising, the environment is being destroyed and so-called globalisation is giving rise to new forms of exploitation and spreading poverty and hunger across the planet."
"The limited sums available for structural policies, the reduction in agricultural spending and the funds earmarked for the common foreign policy, defence and security typify the aggressive attitude of capital towards the people and the role which the European Union is being called on to play as the sidekick of the USA as it polices the world."
"We are opposed to this policy and to the methods applied by big business."
"We reject the modus operandi of the monopolies, we are fighting with the workers to overturn these plans and we demand a different sort of policy, a policy which will bring about economic prosperity for the workers and secure their rights."
"Mr President, Commissioners, I have five very specific questions to ask."
"Why is the Commission proposing the reform of the CFP, which, as everyone knows, is planned for 2002, without a budget of its own?"
"It should be rejected for this reason alone..."
"Why is the Commission attempting to devote the entire FIFG fund to the reduction, which has no legal base, when the legal provisions on the change in the socio-economic situation of the labour market are not being complied with, despite having been agreed on, and even put forward by the Member States?"
"Why is the Commission banning fleet modernisation, whenever this is required, as in any other economic sector?"
"Why is there no budget for economic and social measures to compensate for the effects of the reform?"
"Why is the Commission thinking of reducing the fleet by eight thousand vessels when the reform's effects on the Mediterranean, which is home to a large part of the European fleet, are still not known?"
"Mr President, I would like to commend the various rapporteurs and draftsmen on their excellent work on the 2003 budget."
"As regards the proposals for agricultural spending in the coming year, I note that the preliminary draft budget adopted by the Commission leaves a margin of EUR 2.3 billion under the ceiling agreed by the financial perspective."
"We are all aware of the current difficulties faced by farmers."
"Many colleagues come from Member States which were this summer struck by floods and landslides."
"Many farmers lost crops, animals and even their homes."
"The emergency aid voted through will go some way to help alleviate the problems faced."
"However, we should not be thinking of cutting back on farm expenditure and need to avail of the ample margins available to us."
"In my own country, Ireland, there has been an almost 20% drop in farm incomes this year when inflation is factored in."
"In the industrial and service sector such a cut would never be accepted but farmers are expected to put up with the vagaries of world market prices which are currently at rock bottom across a range of commodities."
"In this respect, it is totally unacceptable that the Council has proposed an across-the-board reduction in agricultural spending in comparison with that which the Commission has proposed."
"The attempt by the Council to shave EUR 275 million off market expenditure in such hard-hit sectors as arable crops, milk, beef and mutton and lamb is completely out of order under the current climate."
"As far as my own group is concerned, we have tabled a series of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage."
"I would highlight the number of lines where we believe there is a need to strengthen existing schemes."
"The school milk scheme, for example, has proved itself to be highly effective and must be continued and expanded."
"Similarly, installation aid for young farmers is a key component in ensuring the future of farming, particularly in the more isolated regions which have a structure of small family farms."
"Farming needs to be made an attractive career prospect and if we are to bring young qualified people into the profession, a failure to do so will lead to further depopulation of rural areas to the point where certain rural communities will no longer be sustainable."
"This has negative consequences also for urban areas."
"I also strongly support information actions on the common agricultural policy."
"It is important to get the message across to European citizens that we are all beneficiaries of the European model of farming."
"What we are paying for is an agriculture that is environmentally sound, guarantees the highest levels of food safety and traceability and upholds standards of animal welfare."
"Mr President, this year, once again, the agriculture budget has been subject to a certain amount of rigour which I believe reflects certain political views rather than the true situation of the agriculture sector."
"Apart from this reservation, maintaining a margin of EUR 2.3 billion below the financial perspectives could be justified."
"But is the Commission prepared to mobilise these funds swiftly should the markets become stagnant?"
"Let us take as an example the appropriations allocated to eradicating epizootic diseases and to the Emergency Veterinary Fund."
"These were severely reduced even though so much remains to be done, both in the field of prevention and in terms of research."
"The year 2003 will be characterised by an evolving CAP."
"Half way through, the Commission turned the review into a proposal for fundamental reform, which appears to ignore farmers and their wellbeing and turn them into mere tools."
"I believe this departure, which consists of divesting the CAP of any substance in the name of a so-called rural development policy, is a mistake, and I would like to hear the Commission's reply to the following questions."
"Given that we originally chose a common agricultural policy, do you not think that it is the Union's responsibility to pay at least as much attention to this sector as the United States, by allocating the corresponding financial means, rather than aiming to match world prices?"
"How can we ensure that the ambition of European rural development does not encroach upon national and local competence in the field of land use planning?"
"Is this not a way of promoting environmental concerns which are addressed under another budgetary heading?"
"I wonder if this is really the role of the CAP."
"Do you think we can simultaneously try to bring our prices into line with world prices and increase production costs, while contenting ourselves with applying a 'communicating vessels' policy to the first and second pillars?"
"On the subject of CAP reform, I would like to speak out against the all too frequent tendency of this House to criticise the size of our EU agriculture budgets."
"It angers me to hear that it is scandalous for the Union to devote 45% of its budget to agriculture."
"In fact, this 45% only represents 3% of the public budgets of the Union and the Member States."
"3% of public budgets allocated to 5% of the population, 3% of public budgets allocated to 60% of EU territory, 3% of public budgets allocated to our food, our food safety, maintaining agricultural revenue and to the orientation of agriculture markets."
"3% of public budgets allocated to agriculture is less than the percentage in the United States."
"According to the OECD, US agricultural policy costs USD 338 per taxpayer in comparison with USD 276 in the European Union."
"So, just as our US counterparts, in view of the failure of their previous agricultural act, the Fair Act, have decided to increase aid to agriculture by 70% at a time when some countries have the advantage of large areas of land, using advanced agricultural technologies, benefiting from extremely low labour costs, and implementing dumping policies that destabilise prices world-wide, we should not call into question the Berlin agreements by wanting to impose a reduction in our agriculture budgets within the EU."
"Nor must we let it be said that our agriculture budgets are an obstacle to progress in developing countries."
"Our CAP and the associated budgets offset the social and environmental restrictions we impose on our farmers, and aim to provide them with a comparable quality of life to that of the rest of the Union's population."
"The developing countries, and in particular the poorest among them, have a high proportion of poor peasant farmers, and what these poor farmers need is not increased liberalism placing them in competition with largescale high-tech farming throughout the world, but, on the contrary, to be able to increase their productivity by selling their food products on regional or national markets."
"We must not aim for the wrong target. It is not our so-called protectionism that is causing poor third-world farmers to starve, but, on the contrary, dogmatic free trade aimed at placing farmers with vastly differing levels of technology and productivity in competition with each other."
"This, appropriately, was what the Senegalese and Indian Ministers for Agriculture were saying at Johannesburg."
"Lastly, if we really want to reduce the public budgets allocated to agriculture, it is perhaps time to reopen discussions on Community preference, by defining a new, updated Community preference system that would allow the extra cost imposed on our agriculture sector by our high food safety, social, environmental and animal welfare requirements to be absorbed internally into the agriculture prices on the Community market."
"In order to do this, Mr President, Commissioners, we must firmly turn our back on the aberrant dogma of world prices."
"Mr President, we have a Commissioner for Agriculture and Fisheries who - and I am now talking as my group's shadow rapporteur for the fisheries budget - is at any rate decisive and, if you will allow me a personal comment, has guts, courage and a proven vision in terms of the EU's enlargement."
"As for fisheries, this Commissioner has also launched far-reaching proposals aimed at sustainable fisheries, that are also in line with the agreements made at the Johannesburg Summit finally to reach true sustainable fisheries."
"At the same time, there is something lacking there;"
"I note with regard to the fisheries budget that this decisiveness is not translated into major shifts or priorities in the fisheries budget up to 2003."
"You could, of course, claim that the fisheries policy is only partly being launched, but I should nevertheless like to mention a few points concerning the fisheries policy."
"Parliament and the Council have indicated that we consider it important, as a result of the failure in Spain of the fisheries agreements with Morocco, that money be set aside for the regions in question."
"The Committee on Fisheries insists on this being done."
"Secondly, we are facing far-reaching decisions."
"This means that the responsibility of fishermen is considerable and that producer groups in the fisheries sector deserve extra support in this."
"We have tabled specific amendments in this area too and would greatly appreciate it if the Commission were to adopt them."
"Thirdly, far-reaching decisions in the fisheries sector also means that a number of regions will actually be affected."
"I would refer to cod fishing in Scotland, but also to areas along the North Sea."
"This means that employment, namely indirect employment in the ports and indirect employment in the fish-processing industry, will be badly affected in those regions."
"In this respect, Europe needs to invest to create replacement employment, also in terms of sustainability in those regions."
"We would, in this connection, like the Commission seriously to consider, and subsequently adopt, a number of amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries."
"Mr President, Commissioners, have no fear, I am neither a fisherwoman nor a farmer."
"Neither do I wish to comment on the reform of agricultural policy."
"My contribution will be confined to reiterating yet again my request for cofinancing."
"I have been asking for this for three years now."
"That should be enough!"
"I am here as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and as a shadow rapporteur."
"The person I am shadowing, Robert Goodwill - who is the rapporteur for the budget - has already left."
"All of the areas of agricultural policy on which I have questions or which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tackled have already been addressed by him or other colleagues."
"The first is tobacco subsidies."
"This issue has been raised time and again since 1994."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is calling for tobacco subsidies to be abolished."
"Obviously the Committee on Budgets cannot accommodate this request because we have a market organisation and we have to work within the legislative framework."
"Hence my very specific question to you, Mr Fischler: when is the Commission finally going to table a proposal explaining how it will contrive gradually to convert the areas under tobacco?"
"I know that there is any amount of discussion about this."
"And I do not mean these half-baked ideas which are envisaged for the tobacco fund."
"Neither is it acceptable for you to answer that it is all far too expensive because converting jobs - in whatever sector - costs anything from EUR 31 000 to EUR 391 000."
"My next question concerns the Food Safety Authority."
"When are you finally going to put pressure on the Council to let us have the Food Safety Authority?"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, in my opinion, Commissioner Fischler has a vision for the future, since he has already answered a number of questions on the mid-term review and about the supplementary and amending budget of October."
"However, I have a question on the period that follows."
"In the Böge report on enlargement, which we adopted in May of this year, Parliament asked the Commission to outline agricultural policy after 2006 and what the expenses would roughly be."
"The mid-term review does not include the milk quotas reform, but options are given instead."
"What are the costs of those options?"
"Are there, within the framework of changing the sugar policy, plans in connection with Everything but Arms, and what are the costs involved?"
"My next point concerns next year's budget and also, to some extent, this year's."
"Parliament had tabled a number of amendments to examine how we could protect ourselves against the outbreak of infectious animal diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, and how more funding can be made available for the development of marker vaccines and ancillary testing methods."
"As far as I know, it is nearly October and the Commission has shown no intention of launching these initiatives."
"Some preparatory work has been done, but neither of the studies has been started."
"It is, in my view, extremely serious that approximately nine months following the adoption of the budget, not even a start has been made on two issues that are so important for public opinion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like - quite briefly given the advanced hour - to respond to the questions that have been raised here."
"I do not think that I need to return to the last question, put by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, about these 32 million and the 27 million, as I already dealt with this in my first intervention."
"Several Members have indicated that they are opposed to these across-the-board cuts of 0.8% and I too am against a systematic cut of this kind; furthermore I believe that generally speaking this is a book-keeping exercise and not a political act."
"Policy-making is after all actually about deploying resources selectively and not simply applying the same iron-fisted approach across the board."
"Several Members asked why there are no proposals on tobacco, sugar or milk in the mid-term review."
"I should like to remind you that a study is underway on tobacco; this study will be completed at the end of the year."
"From the outset - and we have also discussed this several times here in this Parliament - the intention was that we should table a proposal for a new type of market organisation for tobacco next year."
"The same, incidentally, applies to sugar."
"It is quite clear that the market organisation that we have for sugar at the moment will not be able to survive in its current form, particularly if you take into account the impact that the 'Everything but Arms' initiative will have once the transitional period has elapsed, and that changes will therefore be necessary."
"Here too, however, I have already informed Parliament several times that we intend to work on these next year."
"As far as milk is concerned, in principle this is contained in the mid-term review, which also makes it clear that the Commission is prepared at any time to make a legislative proposal adjusting the common organisation of the market in milk, but only if it is clear that the Member States are prepared politically to go in a particular direction."
"At present we actually have no chance of getting anywhere near the necessary majority in the Council."
"That then is also why it makes little sense to table a legislative proposal."
"Cofinancing - and I know that for many of you this is a pet subject - is not an appropriate topic for discussion in a debate on an annual budget; it is something for the next financial perspective."
"That is the context in which it needs to be discussed because it does of course go far beyond agriculture alone."
"Incidentally, the provisions on cofinancing will in any case be changed or extended to some extent if we transfer funds from the first to the second pillar because cofinancing is automatically guaranteed in the second pillar."
"In this regard I can only agree with all of those who referred here to yesterday's article in The Financial Times, because although on the one hand in this article it is stated that the common agricultural policy is better than its reputation - a sermon that I preach around once every week - it is also clear that people want to see rural development given a boost and that they wish to have better quality and food safety."
"The only thing is that when it comes to practical implementation we also have to say where the money to boost rural development is going to come from."
"There is only one source of money available here and that is the first pillar."
"Anyone who tries to deny this fact does not exactly help us to make real progress with this policy."
"I should like, incidentally, to make one more comment on this article, namely that, as I see it, it is becoming clear that agricultural policy has taken a turn for the better in those areas where there has been a willingness to implement appropriate reforms."
"An unwillingness to reform does not do either agricultural policy or farmers any favours."
"Turning to the question about modernising the fleet and why we are blocking this, I do not wish to provoke a debate on fisheries reform now - we have sufficient opportunity to discuss these issues - but I should simply like to remind you that the Commission's proposals do not contain any provision on compulsory scrapping of a particular number of vessels in a particular segment in a particular Member State; we simply open up possibilities."
"Each shipowner continues to have the right to decide and no individual or Member State is being ordered or forced to scrap."
"It is time that these allegations stopped, because they only help to perpetuate bad feeling amongst fishermen."
"We really must discuss this on the basis of the facts."
"If you say that the bad weather in Ireland has had such a serious effect on farmers' income, then I can assure you that we are also prepared to help Ireland."
"In this case, of course, we are not talking primarily about advance payments for arable premiums, but mainly about premiums for cattle."
"We are prepared to transfer the advances as early as 16 October, the first day on which the money is available."
"I will just comment briefly on the question of research into animal diseases."
"Research has to be addressed within the research budget."
"Research into animal diseases also takes place in the research framework programme and not in our own budget."
"We have to ensure that this is a focus of research work, and we have done so."
"Mr Maat is right to say that there can be no particular shift in the financial priorities in the year 2003, but in both sectors - agriculture and fisheries - we have a little chicken-and-egg problem."
"Some say that policy can only be designed on the basis of a budget, which means that you first have to enter more resources in the budget or transfer funds from elsewhere so that you can choose to reform within a sound legal framework."
"Others say that we first need to know what the policy looks like before we can talk about the financial resources that will be required."
"This is the practice that has been observed by Parliament hitherto."
"That is why it is important for us to take further steps towards reforming fisheries and agriculture."
"Only then can we actually determine the specific sums involved in detail."
"If you do not know the policy it makes the calculations very difficult."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it has been very useful to attend the debate on behalf of the Council."
"Both Parliament and the Commission have touched upon important themes concerning the 2003 budget. I have taken note of the various points of view, and I can assure you that I shall pass them on to my colleagues in the Council."
"I should nonetheless like to add a number of observations to a couple of the speeches that have been made."
"Like the European Parliament, the Council is particularly alert to the large surplus in respect of the EU budget, amounting last year to EUR 15 000 million."
"Today's debate has indicated both the Commission's and the Member States' responsibility in this area, and this needs to be followed up."
"With regard to the mid-term review of agricultural policy, I should like to emphasise that the Danish Presidency will do what it can to further the negotiations on reform."
"Another important topic on which the Council and the European Parliament must find common solutions is that of setting up the special fund for dealing with the consequences of the floods in Central Europe."
"Yesterday evening, we had an extraordinary trialogue on this subject, and I am pleased to be able to say that the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council are agreed that the necessary decisions can be taken and legal acts adopted before the end of October."
"I anticipate the Council's being able to make the necessary contribution to this process."
"There is now already in theory an agreement to establish a fund of up to EUR 1 000 million per year, and it is important for the EU as quickly as possible to be able to step up its aid to the victims of the floods in Austria, Germany and the candidate countries affected."
"On 3 September, my colleague Bertel Haarder, Minister for European Affairs, presented here in Parliament the result of the Council's first reading of the 2003 budget and took the opportunity of emphasising the agreements and the common understandings resulting from the meeting for consultation on 19 July."
"I am very pleased with this result."
"It means a lot to the Danish Presidency that we have full backing in the Council for discussing crucial topics with Parliament at an early stage."
"It was agreed on 19 July that the administrative preparation for enlargement is a main priority that the institutions will be able to address from now on and throughout 2003, and I should like to emphasise that the administrative basis for enlargement has been secured by means of the agreement on administrative expenditure for 2003."
"This early agreement also gives the institutions the best possible basis for planning in connection with the preparation for enlargement."
"There has also, here today, been a very thorough debate on the EU's external tasks."
"In that connection, it is encouraging that a common understanding has been reached of the need to work towards securing funding for the Common Foreign and Security Policy in the light of essential new tasks."
"As I mentioned to begin with, an important priority in this connection is the EU's assumption of responsibility for the UN's policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"We are also agreed about trying to reach an agreement on involving Parliament in the CFSP arrangements within the framework of the Treaty."
"The fact that the emergency aid reserve for humanitarian assistance can now also be used for civil crisis management is also a significant result."
"In June, a common understanding was also reached about the need to fund the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets and about the need to keep the overall payment appropriations as low as possible."
"I am of course aware that that there is still a way to go before we can enter into a final joint agreement on the 2003 budget."
"Today's debate has helped clarify Parliament's and the Commission's ideas and attitudes, and I am certain that we can continue the sound cooperation between the institutions and, together, find the necessary solutions so that, in December, a budget can be adopted based on a detailed prioritising of EU funds within the financial estimates."
"In this way, we shall be able jointly to meet the challenges of the next few years."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, I just want to thank everybody, because, as I said at the beginning, this was a unique event."
"We have never done anything like this before."
"In the main it has been successful."
"Granted, some Members just made standard speeches, but there has been some good debate and we have had some good responses."
"We have also had some confusing responses, especially on the Global Health Fund."
"I should like to thank all those who have taken part, especially the individual Commissioners, and Mrs Schreyer for being here all the time."
"I should also like to thank the President-in-Office."
"During this presidency, the Danes have achieved several firsts in the budget procedure and to sit here for four and a half hours is a massive first."
"It has never been done before."
"I must also note that Mr Elles' speech in which he set out six priorities of the PPE-DE Group was very good."
"Three of them seemed to have more to do with getting British Conservatives onto the list, which is going ahead at present, than with budgetary rigour or budgetary sense."
"I am sure Mr Elles will take that in the manner in which it is meant."
"All in all it has been a good debate and I should like to thank all those who have taken part."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Written declaration (Rule 120)"
"The Commission can accept over half of the tabled amendments (35 out of 60), as such (16) or in part or principle (19)."
"·- The Commission can accept amendments 2, 6, 8, 11, 20, 28, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 46, 50, 51 and 55 which improve the quality of the original Proposal notably by aligning its wording with Biosafety Protocol."
"·- In addition, amendments 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 34, 36, 42, 52 and 54 can be accepted in principle and 21, 56 and 60 in part."
"These amendments clarify important points, notably on the definitions, the notification procedures and the access of the public to the information."
"However, some redrafting needs to be done, notably on amendments 19, 21 and 52 where the Commission would prefer a wording more in line with the Protocol for cases of absence of decision by the Party of Import."
"·- The Commission cannot accept the rest of the amendments (25), namely amendments 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 16, 17, 22, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 38, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 53, 57, 58 and 59."
"Mr President, as announced in the Commission's Transport White Paper of 12 September 2001, the Marco Polo Programme will provide Community funding to new international transport solutions which offer a viable alternative to road-freight transport."
"More specifically, the programme should help shift the expected increase in international road freight of 12 billion tonnes per km per year from congested roads to short-sea shipping, rail and inland waterway services."
"The programme will be operational by 2003 and will last until 2010."
"For the five-year period from 2003-2007, we propose an overall budget of EUR 115 million."
"Marco Polo is an ambitious and pragmatic programme, geared to concretely improving services and logistics in the short-sea, rail and inland waterway freight markets."
"At the same time, it provides for appropriate monitoring and control to exclude unacceptable distortions of competition in the market."
"Marco Polo is thus more than a single continuation of the PACT Programme, which came to an end on 31 December 2001."
"Marco Polo will be able to co-fund actions leading to modal shifts and better practices in all segments of the short-sea shipping, rail and inland waterway freight logistic markets."
"It will not be restricted to the combined transport sector as PACT was."
"Marco Polo will also support actions involving countries outside the European Union and candidate countries, in particular the applicant countries, whereas PACT excluded them."
"The programme also gives clear policy directions to industry on what changes the Community expects and needs in the freight market."
"In this context, it proposes funding for three different types of actions: modal shift actions, catalyst actions and common learning actions."
"A few words on each of them."
"Modal shift actions: these involved start-up aid for new services in the non-road freight market."
"Catalyst actions: this aid is also limited in time and should lead to viable non-road freight services."
"However, these actions are more ambitious than modal shift actions."
"They should change the way that non-road freight transport is conducted in Europe."
"Common learning actions: these seek to improve cooperation and share know-how in an increasingly complex transport and logistics industry."
"In order to achieve a real European added value, the Commission proposes to support only projects of significant impact on the market, which implies sufficiently large contracts."
"I have outlined to you the Commission's objective in setting up the programme and I now look forward with great interest to the debate."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for her opening comments on the general aims of the Commission's proposals."
"I have several important points to make on my report concerning the Marco Polo Programme."
"Firstly, this programme must strike a proper balance."
"It would be extremely counterproductive to bury business in yet more red tape, notwithstanding the need for efficient scrutiny of how money is spent and how effective the programme is proving to be."
"Secondly, in my view as rapporteur, it is essential that the programme remains market-driven."
"This provides an excellent opportunity to show that the EU is prepared to help, not hinder, business, as is so often the accusation."
"I especially welcome the committee's decision to lower the thresholds involved."
"This is something I have been adamant in fighting for, not just on behalf of numerous small and medium-sized enterprises in my own region, but also for SMEs in general which, if it were not for these low thresholds, would miss out entirely on funding which is there to help them achieve the goals of the programme."
"Thanks to the new proposed new thresholds, companies could work together or alone in putting forward innovative projects that will benefit the industry as a whole."
"Keeping the original thresholds would mean that small businesses had once again been ignored by the European Union, which would seem to be merely interested - from the Commission's own comments - in showcase schemes."
"This, whilst looking good, does not benefit the people who pay for them - the taxpayers."
"In order to advance the immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme - those of improving the environmental performance of freight transport and reducing road congestion, albeit in a relatively small way - this lowering of subsidy thresholds is crucial."
"I also view as a welcome addition to this report, and one that well accompanies the reduction in these thresholds, the simplified definitions."
"This may not sound much to those of us who have been working on the report since March, but to the already overburdened managers of companies in the freight transport system all over Europe it would prove a great help in making applications for assistance for projects much easier."
"Indeed, these definitions could well prove to be the difference between companies not fully understanding the system - and hence not bothering to apply - and SMEs having much greater confidence in approaching the Commission with bids for their own innovative projects."
"My last point reiterates one of the main aims of this proposal: that of reducing bottlenecks."
"I agree with the Commission that congestion threatens both the environment and the operational working of the whole freight transport sector."
"It is therefore imperative that we concentrate, in practical ways, on how to defuse these bottlenecks, especially around sea ports."
"With regard to some of my earlier points, I feel that the lowering of the thresholds and the simplified definitions also apply here."
"It would be wrong to infer that only large-scale projects can reduce bottlenecks."
"I believe that innovative projects, on a smaller scale, can have just as much practical use - indeed if not more so - than those costing many millions of euros."
"Thus, given the final outcome of the report in committee, I reiterate the necessity of our open approach - the carrot rather than the stick - designed to encourage the participation of the business community."
"Success will very much depend on enterprises coming forward with their ideas, not those thrust upon them by regulation."
"I would commend the report to the House."
"Mr President, I am very much in favour of this programme."
"Mr Bradbourn has made very sensible suggestions and has a feel for the needs of the travelling public, in particular those in cars who are delayed by heavy freight vehicles."
"I applaud the entire Marco Polo Programme, which is badly needed to stop congestion."
"I am a civil engineer by background."
"I served on the Transport Committee in the House of Commons in London for eight years and know only too well by travelling up and down to my north-west region from London how very difficult it is to do something about this problem."
"I applaud the fact that new initiatives will be encouraged by this programme, ensuring that traffic is phased into junctions by using light-emitting diodes etc., things which are cheap but which are very effective and absolutely vital."
"We must ensure that this scheme is properly monitored."
"That is the idea behind the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"We emphasise that, half way through the period up to 2010, there should be a thorough audit and investigation of what has been achieved."
"I agree entirely with Mr Bradbourn that we should not just go for large schemes, because out there the logistics industry - and I applaud its efforts up and down the country and across all countries in the European Union - has a lot of ideas that it wants to start up."
"That is where much improvement can take place."
"I understand that the Council is anxious to reduce the amount of money being made available for this project."
"However, I hope that even if that does take place, we will show by the mid-term review that we are getting excellent value for money and that the budget should be raised in future years."
"I applaud everyone involved in this very forward-thinking scheme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly my many thanks go to Mr Bradbourn for his sterling work and his report."
"The purpose of the Marco Polo programme is to reduce the social costs of traffic and, obviously, this basic idea and aim are very much worthy of support."
"But as the old saying goes, 'All that glitters is not gold'."
"Unfortunately, I see Marco Polo as being part of the Commission's programme to forcibly shift traffic from the roads to the railways."
"For this reason I cannot agree with what it says in the White Paper, that shares between the various transport modes should be retained and frozen at their present level until 2010."
"This cannot be a natural development, because we are barking up the wrong tree."
"It is true that road transport is responsible for a lot of congestion and pollution, but that is due to the fact that there simply is no other means of transport that compares to it."
"Freight transport is forced onto the roads because it is the most effective option."
"It is the fastest, the most flexible, and, most important of all, the cheapest form of transport for the end user."
"The citizens of Europe pay for transport and if it does not run efficiently and cheaply in Europe, we all suffer the consequences."
"In fact, believe me, those who always suffer most are those who have no alternative - those whose means are the smallest of all."
"We should establish good incentives for different modes of transport and consider their overall costs, their benefits and their disadvantages to society as a whole."
"If we start off that way, it is all the same whether the share of road traffic is 1% or 100%."
"We need sufficient investment in the whole transport infrastructure, but the EU cannot be primarily responsible for finance, as we do not happen to be a money-dispensing machine."
"Although this idea of the Commission unfortunately has a somewhat faulty basis there is also much that is positive about Marco Polo."
"The interoperatability of different transport modes, where we get something that works very well from the whole, is important."
"We must constantly remember that we are using the taxpayer's money, and we have to use it as efficiently as possible, and certainly not in any populist way."
"I would like to repeat that there should not be an aim here to reduce road transport but rather reduce its adverse effects, because if a patient is sick you will certainly not cure him by killing him off, but by giving him the proper medicine."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Marco Polo is a well thought-out instrument that is designed to promote a shift in freight transport from road to more environmentally friendly modes of transport, and this at international level."
"It is a practical instrument that will help us to achieve the aim that we have in transport policy, which is, as you know, to stabilise the modal split at its 1998 levels, or restore it to those levels."
"Hopefully it will be operational as early as next year."
"Other measures that we envisaged in the White Paper - for example, the first railway package, which we have already adopted, and the second, which we are now working on; cross-financing from road to rail; charges for heavy goods vehicles; internalising external costs - will all only have an effect in the long term or at the very earliest in the medium term if we really get them on track."
"The Commission's three proposed actions in the programme have clearly been inspired by its experience with PACT."
"After all, this was a very successful programme, which achieved a great deal over many years, even if the focus is now rather different."
"Although we now have more money than under PACT, the challenge is also greater, and that is why we need to ensure that the programme's scope is very precisely delimited."
"In the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, in a coalition of common sense in transport policy, we managed by and large to identify the main focus of the instrument."
"In the plenary, however, we are having to work together to fend off two attempts to render this programme of assistance powerless by extending it."
"The first is a proposal to extend the scope to include intermodal transport."
"My group opposes the rapporteur's Amendments Nos 8, 10 and 12, because they again seek to contribute, indirectly, to subsidising road freight transport."
"I do not have anything against intermodality, but that is not the aim this time round; this time it is first and foremost about modal shift."
"Secondly, we must reject an extension of the scope to transport prevention actions."
"My group opposes the amendments re-tabled by the Greens, seeking in addition to carry out actions on transport prevention on this tight budget."
"I would be happy at any time to support a new programme on transport prevention, but its inclusion here would overstretch the programme and after all we want to implement it strategically."
"Here, less is more!"
"Together we agreed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism that we do not want any distortions of competition between the environmentally acceptable modes of transport."
"We have lowered the minimum subsidy thresholds for the actions, as the rapporteur has explained; we have judged cooperation between operators involved in cross-border transport projects - for example in corridor conferences - to be worthy of support, and we want a budget increase to be reconsidered as part of the mid-term review."
"I hope that the Council and the Commission will respond to our ideas quickly so that the programme can start next year, because the increasing problems with road freight transport mean that delay is not an option."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bradbourn, for his thorough work."
"The need to improve the freight transport system in terms of the environment is a vital one, with the amount of traffic continually growing."
"The enlargement of the EU will also bring with it new challenges as transportation routes get longer."
"Our group supports the Marco Polo programme and is satisfied with the Committee's proposal."
"The EU can bring added value to this area by supporting innovative, new technology projects."
"No mode of transport should be excluded from the programme."
"Transport chains that may also involve transportation by road must also be included."
"If a project, in which road haulage companies are included, is good, it must be possible to apply for aid for it."
"The aim must be to move from a more polluting mode of transport to more environmentally friendly transport solutions."
"In my opinion, it is important that we can also lend our support to improving the existing situation."
"Improvements can often be made by means of a better cost-benefit ratio rather than by starting on an entirely new project."
"In concentrating only on new projects there is a clear danger of distortions of competition in relation to the old ones."
"It is right that the regulation should include a separate mention of sea transport and keep the reference to 'motorways of the seas'."
"'Motorways of the seas' is also given a separate mention in the White Paper on Transport; it is therefore only natural to include it in this regulation."
"As the rapporteur said, threshold values for all types of action in the Commission proposal are too high."
"The threshold values for modal shift projects, catalyst actions and common learning actions must, as the Committee is proposing, be halved."
"Parliament's amendments will not radically alter the essentials, but will make certain points in the Commission proposal clearer."
"We support Amendment No 29 tabled by the Group of the Greens and other amendments which aim to prevent and reduce unnecessary traffic."
"The programme's budget is fairly modest and the objectives are very ambitious."
"We think, however, that it is important to set targets that are as ambitious as possible."
"In the longer term we hope that Marco Polo will prove worthwhile and attract additional funding."
"We must in addition investigate the possibility of additional finance for important infrastructure projects that supplement the Europe-wide traffic networks."
"Mr President, the effects of 'die Wende' in Dutch politics are slowly beginning to take shape."
"This is certainly no cause for celebration in the area of transport."
"Road transport takes centre stage in the plans of the new Dutch Government."
"Railways have a rough deal in the investment plans, and inland shipping even more so."
"In our opinion, such an attitude is not conducive to a transport system that can stand the test of time."
"Considerable investments in infrastructure for the benefit of road transport will not only promote supply, but also demand."
"On balance, this means that the existing problems are not being addressed."
"This is why we welcome initiatives such as PACT and Marco Polo as incentives that encourage investments in true solutions and alternatives for (the problems of) road transport in the areas of research, development and operation."
"The fact that we enthuse about the Marco Polo programme does not mean that we would not like to make a few minor observations."
"Not only alternative modes of transport deserve incentives."
"Initiatives within road transport that lead to a reduction in road miles should also be supported by the Marco Polo programme."
"In addition, the programme must be tailored to the situation in the sector or sectors."
"Large projects are bound to have a greater impact, but given the size of most businesses, it is questionable whether such projects will get off the ground in large numbers."
"Subsidy thresholds must be lowered in order to reach the entire sector, whilst the current budget level must be maintained."
"This lowering of subsidy thresholds is also important for extending sustainable transport services."
"Indeed, extending capacity has virtually the same effect on transport flows, while the costs are down compared to when a new service is launched."
"I should like to finish off with a remark about the effects of this programme on the various sectors."
"It strikes me as inevitable that a subsidy for a certain transport sector will affect relations with the other sectors."
"In my view, the conditions imposed on actual support by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are fair and logical."
"Subsidies should not result in effects that go against the Community's interest, particularly against Community policy."
"In addition, it is undesirable for subsidies to lead to a cargo shift between rail, short sea shipping and inland shipping."
"In short, we are largely satisfied with the proposal as it is now before us and will endorse it accordingly."
"I hope that our governments will follow suit."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system has much to recommend it."
"However, there is also much - if not even more - to criticise."
"The objective is positive."
"In the future more freight is to be shifted from road to other more environmentally friendly modes of transport."
"Ideally, this should check the growth in road freight transport resulting from enlargement of the Union."
"For my country, Austria, this is an absolutely fundamental political issue."
"The instruments provided to achieve this are also sensible: start-up support for new, non-road freight transport services, which should however be economically viable in the medium term; support for launching freight services or facilities of strategic European interest, and common learning actions to foster more cooperation in the freight logistics market."
"Working together makes us strong, instead of everyone being against everyone else and opposing anything new."
"The individual amendments proposed by the European Parliament in the Bradbourn report are also good."
"The more SME-friendly minimum subsidy threshold deserves a particular mention here."
"That, however, is the absolute limit as far as the praise is concerned."
"All of the measures that are intended, in the truest sense of the word, to be put in train here are long overdue."
"For far too long we have talked about more environmentally friendly forms of transport without taking appropriate measures."
"It should come as no surprise, therefore, that our roads are full and congested while rail and inland waterways have not for some time been performing at the levels of which they could and should be capable."
"A critical question mark should also be placed over the funds allocated."
"EUR 115 million may be a lot of money, but it is spread over five years and the Marco Polo programme is a different situation yet again for all of the measures that were mentioned just now."
"Last but not least, I would lament a further serious shortcoming at European Community level."
"The way that Europe drafts its legal texts, the public will never understand us."
"With this in mind, I quote from the fifth recital, as also amended by the European Parliament: 'The Marco Polo programme features three types of action: (1) modal shift actions, which should focus on shifting as much cargo as possible under current market conditions from road to the more environmentally acceptable short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways; such actions must not lead to a shift of freight flows from short sea transport, rail or inland waterways to another of these modes, unless the share of freight transport by road in the transport chain is thereby substantially reduced.'"
"Does anyone here understand this language?"
"I find it hard going even when I am reading the text!"
"Mr President, I welcome Marco Polo in principle and in practice."
"Its predecessor, PACT, was very popular in the United Kingdom with both the public and the private sectors."
"I am sure Marco Polo will be even more popular in the United Kingdom."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur for ensuring that Marco Polo will be even more business-friendly than PACT was."
"I agree with the Commissioner that is important that Marco Polo does not lose sight of its main objective, which is to encourage modal shift."
"Why must we do that?"
"Firstly, because we must tackle pollution."
"Transport is the fastest-growing source of global warming gases in Europe."
"Secondly, we must tackle congestion."
"We must, for example, help switch high-volume, long-distance freight away from the road onto the railways where it belongs."
"Action is also clearly needed at EU level, not just at a national level."
"After all, only by encouraging the 15 railway companies to work together can some of the artificial national barriers to free movement be removed."
"Action is also needed to encourage greater use of our ports, seas and inland waterways."
"40 per cent of freight already goes by sea."
"That is an area where we can - and because of Marco Polo will - see more growth."
"Marco Polo will make a difference there."
"Finally, and most importantly, let us not get carried away with our own rhetoric."
"Marco Polo is a positive move but, on its own, it is clearly nowhere near enough."
"The PSE Group urges the Commissioner to encourage more actions like this and encourage the Member States themselves to take on board their own responsibilities to encourage modal shift in a much more dramatic and radical way than we have seen in the past."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Bradbourn's report."
"He can certainly count on my vote in tomorrow's plenary."
"I particularly support his view that modal shift should not be the programme's only goal."
"The programme should also look to reduce congestion, lower thresholds and increase accessibility."
"The goal of the Marco Polo programme should, in fact, be extended, so that the programme can also contribute to the search for and development of more sustainable transport systems."
"I therefore value this line of approach."
"Sustainable transport systems cannot be achieved by modal shift actions alone."
"We must extend these actions to other forms of transport, including not only inland shipping but also short sea shipping, and of course rail transport."
"Roads remain of crucial importance, with a reduction of traffic congestion by more efficient use of them being the starting point."
"This is extremely important."
"This brings me straight to the next point, which is savings in transport."
"I am pleased with the amendments that the Greens have tabled before the plenary and I will endorse them."
"A great deal is to be gained from transport saving techniques."
"These are worth investigating within the framework of the Marco Polo programme."
"In addition, the important point is made that we must stay one step ahead of developments in transport."
"My objection is that only rather limited resources have been made available over a five-year period."
"The amount of EUR 150 million has already been mentioned, and this is precious little to follow up PACT, a programme that already proved successful."
"I had expected the budget to be higher, and that may, in fact, turn out to be necessary."
"Also, the Member States themselves need to make efforts in this area and must commit themselves to solving problems, so that new opportunities can present themselves for the economy."
"I hope that the Commission will ensure that good communication is established with society, so that it is possible to seize the opportunities that present themselves."
"Mr President, honourable new Members, I will cut straight to the point."
"Lorries are at their most environmentally friendly when they are off the road."
"We must therefore focus more on transport prevention."
"The Marco Polo programme only deals with other transport, not less transport."
"A programme such as Marco Polo must be more ambitious than the current draft."
"This ambition must also translate into projects geared towards preventing transport."
"The European Union's aim is to grow annually in economic terms."
"However, this economic growth goes hand in hand with a growing demand in transport, and what is worse is that this demand for transport now even exceeds economic growth."
"The correlation between economic growth and transport growth is tragic on different levels The European economy will in this way become increasingly less transport efficient."
"We drive more miles to achieve the same economic results, with more traffic jams and accidents to boot."
"Secondly, the sudden increase in mileage requires an enormous amount of fossil fuels and causes ecological and social damage."
"I take issue with the rapporteur's remarks about the doubtfulness surrounding the calculation of external costs and the increasing eco-efficiency of road transport."
"It is true that the performance of individual lorries is improving, but they are doing more miles."
"This increase in miles negates the profit gained from using an economical and clean engine."
"Journeys must be avoided and economic growth must be disconnected from transport growth."
"We therefore insist that projects aimed at transport prevention also be given scope within a programme such as Marco Polo and should not be discounted from the outset."
"Marco Polo is a very important project to us."
"We would like to see Marco Polo become more ambitious and it should, therefore, also offer opportunities to projects in which transport of this kind is avoided, for that is true innovation."
"Mr President, experience has taught me that when bureaucrats and politicians resort to jargon, citizens should guard their wallets."
"What is one supposed to make of the phrasing used to proclaim that one of the aims of the Marco Polo programme is to maintain the module repetition of freight transport at its 1998 levels by promoting a modal shift from road to other transport modes?"
"Another gem was the heading 'optimism in infrastructure capacity and logistical concepts'."
"This sort of mindless gobbledegook means as much to the ordinary citizen of Europe as a text in ancient Sanskrit."
"The Commission needs to learn that transparency is not about putting things on the website."
"It is about writing in clear, jargon-free language that ordinary people can understand."
"As to the substantive issue of reducing road congestion and improving the environmental performance of the transport system, I note that this ambitious aim is to be funded to the tune of EUR 115 million over 5 years."
"That is just EUR 23 million a year to be spent Europe-wide between 15 Member States - or is it to be 25 Member States?"
"Frankly, even if this aim could be achieved by the Commission's financial instrument - and I share Mr Bradbourn's scepticism on this - the amount of money allocated would hardly begin to dent the problem."
"As always, the Community's ambitions are bigger than our pockets."
"Therein lies the problem."
"The money being spent belongs to the taxpayers of Europe, it is drawn from national governments, each of which has its own unique problems."
"Thus, as always, the Commission is looking for a European problem that does not exist on a European level and then failing to address it."
"Mr Bradbourn's traffic-light solution, however, hardly seems appropriate."
"The problem in eastern England, the region I represent, is that we have neither decent roads nor decent railways."
"Yet improving infrastructure would cost more in my part of England than the whole of the budget allocated to this scheme."
"Given such a pathetic response from the Commission and the clear evidence that this House does not have any better solutions, it would be better to leave transport improvements to national governments."
"Our government in particular seems well capable of making its own mess of our transport policy without any help from the Commission and its jargon."
"Mr President, I welcome this programme to shift freight transport from road to short sea journeys, inland waterways and rail, and also the aim of holding the amount of freight on roads at the present level until 2010."
"I particularly welcome the lower threshold for subsidies and the simplified definitions."
"These measures will be of significant help to SMEs."
"Regarding SMEs, I hope that the Commission's aim of funding large projects, while understandable, does not mean the exclusion of smaller projects which are more likely to be placed in smaller, peripheral Member States which are nonetheless in great need of help and support in this area."
"I think of my own country in this context, with its poor road, rail and inland waterway infrastructure."
"Ireland suffers doubly from safety problems, road congestion and environmental damage."
"I welcome this programme, but it should not exclude smaller innovative projects which are deserving of support."
"Mr President, I welcome this excellent initiative."
"We need to ensure as far as we can that freight is removed from our roads and is placed onto alternative means of transport."
"Ireland has benefited greatly from EU funding to develop its rail and road infrastructure."
"It is currently in receipt of monies to develop a new tramway system in Dublin and a tunnel to take freight from the north side of the city - the M50 in the airport area - to the docks, thus keeping unnecessary freight from the city's streets."
"I want to raise a serious problem that has arisen in relation to the completion of the M50 in the Carrickmines area of Dublin."
"Around EUR 74 million has been allocated to this project."
"It has been found that an environmental impact assessment study which has been necessary to qualify for EU funds is seriously flawed."
"It did not identify an internationally important archaeological site, Carrickmines Castle, which contains, amongst other things, the remains of a 13th century Norman castle."
"The motorway, as currently planned, will bury this site before an archaeological dig has been carried out."
"It is not appropriate that European taxpayers' money should be used in this way to destroy our heritage."
"It is not just Irish heritage, it is European heritage."
"I am calling on the Commission to intervene urgently to have the construction of this road stopped until a full review is carried out as to why the environmental impact study did not identify this major archaeological site when it was identified by a state-sponsored organisation, An Foras Forbartha, in 1983."
"This is a major issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the Commission."
"Mr President, I am delighted with the Commission proposal on the Marco Polo programme which should contribute towards a shift in the transport of goods from road mainly to short sea and inland shipping, and soon also to rail."
"At present, the White Paper is before us in Parliament and if there is something we are all agreed on, it is that something should be done to prevent a total standstill."
"Nit-pickers criticise us for interfering with the free market forces in an unacceptable manner, but this is somewhat laughable if one considers the amounts involved."
"As if this small amount would make any difference to market forces!"
"Let us not get carried away here."
"We are already very happy if, with Marco Polo, we can persuade the sectors involved to be more resourceful in thinking of ways of transporting goods from A to B. Road transport should therefore not fear an exodus."
"In fact, within a few years, the sector will want more goods to be transferred to other modalities in order to maintain mobility and cut down on traffic delays."
"With regard to the amendments, we also tried to cater for small investors in the programme, while keeping the programme intact."
"Parliament wants to give the sectors involved a clear signal."
"We are quite happy to help clear obstacles to reach the modal shift."
"We do not want to impose any rules, but we do expect the sectors to use their common sense, for doing nothing leads to inertia and an enormous drop in dynamism and competitiveness."
"The sectors I have talked to have, in fact, interpreted the programme in this way and have appreciated the gesture."
"Rail transport must, in my view, make a greater effort, cut down on red tape and work in a more customer-friendly manner."
"Failing this, I fear that citizens and governments will not be prepared to invest in new or modern rails."
"Can you detect any improvements yet, Commissioner?"
"For I cannot."
"I fail to understand why the Council wishes to cut the programme's funding."
"Europe will make an utter fool of itself."
"More funding would be a more reasonable suggestion."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Parliament for its excellent work on the Commission proposal as shown in the report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"I am delighted that both the Commission and the Parliament share largely the same vision on how to actively promote sustainable transport."
"In particular, I am happy to see that the Parliament supports the Commission with regard to the overall budgetary envelope of the programme."
"You surely know that this is a matter of discussion in the Council."
"The Council may propose a lowering of the amount."
"This would risk rejecting a disproportionate number of good proposals and endangering the very goal of Marco Polo."
"Coming to the proposed amendments, you will not be surprised to hear that the Commission can accept a large number of them, possibly with redrafting or even unchanged in so far as they improve or clarify the Commission's texts."
"However, there are some amendments which, in our view, would not be conducive to the overall goals and management of the programme."
"The Commission rejects these amendments or parts of them."
"Let me briefly explain the position."
"Amendments 14, 15, 21 and 24 aiming at lowering the contract thresholds will not help us to generate projects which by their size are of real European added value."
"We need fewer but larger projects with real impact."
"This will also help the Commission to manage the Marco Polo programme effectively."
"I agree with the concerns of some Members of the Parliament regarding the role and participation of small and medium-sized enterprise, but in fact SMEs do have the opportunity to join trans-national consortia in which any kind of companies can participate."
"The Commission also has a problem with bringing forward the date of its report on the implementation of the programme, as proposed by Amendments 3 and 27."
"While I understand the concerns of the Parliament, the date proposed will not give us enough time to gain experience with the programme."
"Using the term inter-modal action as proposed in Amendments 8, 9, 12 and 28 may carry the risk that we narrow the scope of Marco Polo and exclude important segments of the freight transport sector such as bulk and conventional traffic, which are not inter-modal."
"The Commission must also reject Amendment 10 and part of Amendment 17 aiming at including road transport actions in the programme."
"This is against the modal shift nature of the programme and may render it unmanageable."
"As for the second part of Amendment 28, modal shift between non-road modes is not within the scope of the programme because it would lead to unacceptable distortions of competition and does not focus on the main overall programme objective."
"Moreover, the concentration on maritime transport as such, as proposed in Amendment 16, would narrow down the 'regional motorways of the seas' wording, since the latter includes inland waterways."
"We cannot accept the reduction of the central steering role of the Commission in complex logistical projects as proposed by Amendment 18."
"The detailed financial rules requested by Amendments 25, 26 and 31 seem superfluous as general financial instruments provide for enough control and monitoring."
"Finally, the Commission cannot support part of Amendments 2 and 28, referring to the formation of a common political will in cross-border transport projects as political decision-makers are not targeted by the programme."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the communication being debated today is based on the evaluation by the Commission and the Member States of five years of the employment strategy in practice."
"The results are important and I should like to reiterate a number of them."
"Ten million jobs have been created in Europe, as the result both of economic growth in previous years and efficient reforms on numerous job markets."
"We have seen important structural changes in most Member States, qualitative changes in employment policies and numerous countries have made progress in energising the job market, preventing long-term unemployment, introducing the most employment-friendly tax systems yet, gradually adapting education and training systems and introducing more flexible labour standards."
"What is important about the employment strategy is that the driving force behind it was the management of basic objectives."
"The Member States had common objectives and used the open method of coordination."
"Much still remains to be done and this is set out every year in the Commission's common report and guidelines."
"Your motion contains some very interesting ideas on how we need to proceed and we need to draw on what we have learned to date so that we can make a number of changes."
"I fully endorse the three priorities which you have set: first, the need to increase the rate of employment in relation to the Lisbon objectives, secondly, the question of the quality of work and, thirdly, the need to reduce inequalities on the job market, and here I would highlight the question of inequalities at numerous levels, the gaps on the job market, be they skills gaps, inequalities at regional level or inequalities between the two sexes."
"As far as inequalities between the Member States and the new countries after enlargement are concerned, I disagree with the proposal in the explanatory statement that we should operate with two parallel strategies."
"We need a single strategy and common objectives, although naturally we shall use national recommendations to differentiate our message and accommodate the peculiarities of each country."
"The European Parliament and the Commission also appear to agree on the need to rationalise the procedure."
"One important priority is to ensure the strategy continues to be efficient and discriminating."
"The philosophy we propose is fewer guidelines and a stronger medium-term strategy, more stable guidelines; to put it simply, fewer guidelines which are valid for a longer period of time."
"Again, one question which arises when we talk of updating is the scope of future guidelines."
"What will their scope be?"
"Will they relate specifically to the job market or more globally to all the basic factors which influence employment policies?"
"We take the view that they should have a broad scope which covers the main factors which influence the level and quality of employment in our economy."
"As far as the management model, the method used to manage and administer the employment strategy is concerned, I totally agree that we need to incorporate the employment strategy at all levels of national planning."
"We have seen interesting examples of regional and local employment strategies over the past 5 years, local action plans on employment have been submitted, and this was a successful initiative."
"The commitment and contribution of the two sides of industry is very important."
"Of course, our initial evaluation is that not every means of involving them has been exhausted and that important efforts are needed."
"And as far as the involvement of civil society is concerned, it is still early days as regards any decisive involvement of civil society in employment policies."
"I agree that the national parliaments have a vital role to play."
"The parliamentary Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has already organised events with national parliaments on exchanging experience and information and we believe that this should continue but that, in future proposals, starting with the debate in the Convention, the national parliaments should play a more important part in national action plans and the European Parliament should play a more important part in the European procedure."
"My last comment has to do with bringing the European Employment Strategy into line with the general economic policy guidelines, as proposed in our communication of 3 September."
"We hope that, in adopting this proposal, which I presented to Parliament the day it was adopted, we will achieve greater cohesion between the two strategies, without calling the independence of the employment strategy in question."
"The purpose of the communication taking stock of the strategy, together with the communication on rationalisation, is to start an open debate on the future of the European employment strategy."
"After five years in practice, I think that your report has made a valuable contribution and that the Council will do likewise at its meeting on 8 October, when one of the basic issues of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be the debate on the evaluation and the future of the employment strategy."
"As you know, the official proposal on the 2003 guidelines on employment will be submitted next April, together with the proposal on the general economic policy guidelines."
"In the interim, there is time enough for everyone to take part in this procedure and express their opinion."
"In order to broaden and facilitate this debate, the Commission intends to publish a further communication in January which, as far as the timing of specific proposals is concerned, will come halfway between the communications already approved and the proposal for the 2003 guidelines."
"This means we shall have two-and-a-half months in which to conduct an in-depth debate."
"We eagerly await your proposals and, if we draw on experience from the past five years, we shall be able to improve the employment strategy dramatically."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the European Employment Strategy was adopted five years ago it was seen as an important step towards combating unemployment."
"All in all, its four pillars have passed the test."
"The first, employability, includes developing skills and qualifications."
"The second concerns the adaptability of the individual to the ever-increasing demands in companies and society."
"The third is entrepreneurship with the aim of job creation, and the fourth, equal opportunities, is one of the most important pillars, which, like the others, needs to be developed further."
"The very ambitious aim is to make the European Union into the most dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world, but this is not only significant in terms of the economy; there are also clear implications for social policy."
"In 1997 there were 17 million people unemployed in the European Union."
"Last year there were 13 million."
"This year, however, the figures are clearly rising again."
"This is particularly noticeable in my own country, Germany."
"We must not become accustomed to these high figures."
"In some countries, however, there has been an increase in employment and women in particular have benefited from this."
"Nevertheless - and here is the rub - the jobs concerned are mainly part-time and lower qualified jobs."
"The Member States must, by creating the appropriate conditions, by policy-making and by negotiating constructively with the social partners, create higher quality jobs, in particular in the full-time sector."
"We are still miles away from achieving the ambitious goal set in the Lisbon Council Conclusions of an employment rate of 70% or 60% for women between 2000 and 2010."
"In my opinion, which was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we criticise the fact that the Member States still have not set any employment rates for women in their national action plans."
"In the NAPs no significant suggestions are made for improving performance in the equality initiative."
"On average women earn 76% of the hourly rate for men."
"The social partners are called on to implement the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value."
"To create jobs, women also need to be encouraged to found firms or become self-employed through targeted support."
"What does this involve?"
"Reducing the burden on business, simplifying the formalities, particularly at the start-up phase, and setting up funds."
"It also involves securing access for women to education and vocational training."
"Gender-specific discrimination must therefore be combated energetically."
"We call for these steps to be included in the national action plans in the future so that their results can be monitored."
"In the Committee on Equal Opportunities and Women's Rights we addressed one further interesting issue: how better to reconcile work and family life."
"Progress has definitely been made in the Member States."
"However, in many cases working conditions are not sufficiently family friendly."
"There are not enough facilities for the care of children and other dependents and in general there is a lack of flexibility."
"The main points in my opinion were accepted unanimously by the lead committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank Herman Schmid for his concise report and for his ability not only to seek compromises but also to put them into practice."
"My work in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities was not the only say that I had in the Schmid report, because I was also the shadow rapporteur for my group, the PPE, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Despite a willingness to establish common ground, there were quite a few differences of opinion."
"That is why we will be tabling amendments again tomorrow in the plenary."
"Let me give you an example."
"Since the Luxembourg employment summit, which was initiated by the highly successful Council Presidency of Jean-Claude Juncker, we have all endeavoured to achieve better coordination of economic and employment policy."
"Agreed!"
"However, we must not ignore the fact that it is the responsibility of the Member States to take the practical measures."
"That is where investment is made, but unfortunately all too often withheld."
"That is where the competence for taxation, social security and other charges lies."
"There social policy is at home with different national traditions."
"We do not agree that the open coordination method needs to be extended to all areas of social policy."
"Although it is necessary to strengthen democracy and involve as many stakeholders as possible, we must not have it extended haphazardly to any number of players in civil society, because there is a risk, Commissioner, that Members of Parliament, at both national and European level, and the social partners will be sidelined in the process."
"That would be wrong."
"I hope that we are successful in winning the support of other groups for this and other important amendments."
"If so we will have a majority not only in the committees but also in the plenary tomorrow in favour of Herman Schmid's otherwise expert report."
"Mr President, I am delighted that we are having a debate on this vitally important subject."
"It is clear that many Member States still have much to do to reduce high levels of unemployment."
"It is very easy to set targets and to make promises - as Chancellor Schröder has found out - but the jobless need action and not words."
"I agree with the rapporteur that job creation is a major challenge."
"I disagree with his conclusions that we need the Commission to examine anew the causes of low economic growth and to submit suggestions to reverse it."
"The causes are clear, the actions required are clear."
"What is needed is the political will to make it happen."
"There is, however, no solution to unemployment in strengthening the role of the social partners to quote the rapporteur 'in all matters' regarding the organisation of work and working conditions - though I am sure the trade unions are always looking for such an opportunity."
"The social partners may well have a very useful role in some countries and in some cases but, given that the majority of employment growth is coming from SMEs whose employees are beholden neither to big business nor to big unions, it is hard to see how such a move would be positive for job creation."
"Certainly we must all put job creation at the top of our own agendas."
"I earnestly hope that colleagues from all sides of the House, and indeed the Commissioner, will reflect on this when we are voting on the Atypical Workers Directive in a few weeks time."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking Mr Herman Schmid for his extremely valuable cooperation in preparing this report."
"He has been very constructive."
"I share the Commissioner's view that the employment strategy has been successful, as far as we can see."
"During the five years that it has been applied, unemployment has gone down, the number of jobs has increased and, for example, the active labour market policy, which was previously being conducted at a very low level in Europe, has now been considerably improved, partly through lifelong learning."
"Big improvements have taken place."
"Nevertheless, there remains a lot to be done, just as the Commission's document states."
"Unemployment is still too high."
"There is a big gap when it comes to education and lifelong learning."
"Those who already have a high level of education also help themselves to most of the education offered in the labour market, and those who have least education do not obtain as much."
"There are also big regional differences within Europe."
"The overhaul and improvement of the employment strategy are necessary therefore."
"I myself think that the pillar structure has been valuable as a structural instrument, because some parts of the pillar structure have been more successful than others."
"The employability pillar has been relatively successful, and the equality pillar has also been successful in the sense that female employment has increased, even though a lot remains to be done."
"On the other hand, the adaptability pillar, which is a little more difficult to understand, has not been as successful."
"This is nonetheless an important area we must continue to work on, for it is this which has an influence upon working life, the working environment and lifelong learning out there in the workplace."
"All these factors must be improved in the future."
"It is good that the Commission is now proposing to coordinate employment policy and economic policy, but I share Mr Herman Schmid's view that social security too, in relation to which we also have a European process, must be involved in this coordination."
"When coordination takes place, no area must be given precedence over another."
"It is easy, both at national and European levels, to allow economic policy and the economic process to take precedence over the socio-political dimension and considerations relating to employment policy."
"That must not happen. They are equally valuable processes which must be treated equally when coordination takes place."
"I regard open coordination as a complement to legislation, not as an alternative to it."
"We must, however, improve the actual way in which the open method of coordination is applied."
"Since there is no qualified majority in the Council on the issue of the objectives, it is reasonable for the European Parliament to have the right of co-decision concerning these objectives."
"When it comes to the national action plans, I share Mr Herman Schmid's outlook."
"It goes without saying that they must be debated and decided upon in the national parliaments."
"It is only fair that we should have democratic control, both at European and national levels, where these important issues are concerned."
"It is also important to involve other actors."
"Of these, the two sides of industry are perhaps the most important of all."
"It is important for them to be involved in devising policy, both at European level and at the other levels."
"It is also important, as mentioned in our proposal, for the candidate countries to be integrated into this process at an early stage."
"There are a number of differences between the candidate countries and our own countries, but there are also similarities."
"Demographic developments and the demands they make upon the labour market are similar in the candidate countries."
"Consequently, the candidate countries need to be involved in this process soon."
"Moreover, we want to see a clearer link between employment policy and existing economic instruments, namely the European Social Fund and Equal."
"The employment strategy underlying those instruments must be made clear; clearer, that is to say, than it is at present."
"In general, we are encouraged by the developments in this process but, as mentioned earlier, institutional changes are needed: better coordination and a strengthening of the European Parliament and of the national parliaments."
"We must not forget, however, that economic policy, employment policy and the respective councils must be accorded equal value."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should also like to begin by sincerely thanking Mr Herman Schmid for the very expert way in which he has overseen the preparation of this opinion."
"Thanks to his knowledge, expertise and focus, we have obtained a very stringent report."
"I also very much agree with his observations to the effect that the European employment policy must be organised to a greater degree from the bottom up rather than from the top down."
"That is a matter on which I agree with him, in spite of the fact that our political starting points are otherwise very different."
"We have all of us raised the issue of whether the European employment policy has worked, and we have of course genuinely obtained a situation in which countries are speaking more of a common language in some areas."
"Unemployment is nonetheless still high in many countries, and it has almost become a persistent feature of countries that set the trend."
"There is a lack of structural reform and not enough ability to comply with the employment strategy."
"What ought therefore to happen?"
"The answer is that we must strengthen the employment strategy by making it more open, because it is important for governments to commit themselves to the strategy on behalf of their electorates."
"It is important that we simplify the employment strategy and make its objectives clearer, and the Commission and the Council are both thinking along those lines."
"It is the correct path to go down."
"Rather than draw up a long list of quantitative objectives covering every conceivable aspect and then measure success in terms of the amount of reports and paper generated, we must clarify the objectives and ensure good communication."
"It is important that we involve the local and regional authorities and both sides of industry."
"That is something for which Parliament has fought, and it has now become an integral part of the European employment strategy."
"As pointed out in this opinion, it is both desirable and important for us to involve the national and regional parliaments so as to broaden the public debate and enable national politicians to assess the employment strategy, see what is being done in other countries and learn from their experiences."
"On the other hand, I think that open coordination should continue to be intergovernmental, and it must be flexible."
"Employment policy is a national competence, and that is a fact that must not be changed by the back door."
"It is therefore important that no change be made by the back door to the character of employment policy by, for example, giving Parliament the right of co-decision."
"That is not something we can support."
"It is also essential to ensure coordination with economic policy."
"Success in employment policy will of course be synonymous with success in economic policy."
"Many countries struggle with large budget deficits which they would not have at all if they were to abolish large-scale unemployment."
"There must therefore, of course, be better coordination, and I am able to welcome the initiatives the Commission is working on in this area."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his tremendous work on this report."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner for some of the hints she has given us on what she hopes to achieve in the coming year with regard to these guidelines and strategies."
"No-one has yet mentioned that people create jobs."
"Any model where a forced system of state employment or superstructure artificially creates employment is doomed to failure."
"This is because underlying economic development, which ensures that long-lasting, quality jobs can be created, is not there."
"There is, however, a necessity and an urgency for the state to be involved in the protection of workers and the social protection aspects."
"However, when the role of the entrepreneur or business in creating jobs is taken away, then the reality of the employment-creation quandary is undermined."
"When the overall aspects of the different economies within the European Union and throughout the world are considered, those which have created the best and most numerous jobs are those which focus on five key issues. Firstly, a strong social partnership model whereby all the actors at a national level are involved in determining broad economic policy, as well as social policy."
"Secondly, where incentives are given to entrepreneurs and to businesses to invest in new jobs, in new infrastructure and in research and development, giving a longer-lasting guarantee to the creation of manufacturing in other service jobs."
"Thirdly, a very solid and continuously evolving education and training system, because the real tools we should use to adapt our workforce to the present, as well as future, conditions are those of education and knowledge."
"We often hear in this House and other establishments about the idea of lifelong learning."
"What does it really mean?"
"Mr Bouwman mentioned that middle-aged workers had asked him at a fair what he could do about work for them."
"There is a depth of knowledge within the European Union, amongst people between the ages of 45 and 60, that is going untapped, a resource that is being lost because of ignorance, because of a lack of innovative thinking or simply because of a lack of a properly-structured training programme to allow them to adapt to the new market forces and employment opportunities available."
"There is an old saying: give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish, you feed him for life."
"That must be the underlying basis of our strategies with regard to the quality of jobs, work and employment opportunities available - the kinds of skills that we give to people."
"The fourth point concerns competitiveness."
"It may not be a popular thing to say in this House, particularly when we are discussing social affairs, but unless an economy is competitive, it is not going to be able to deal with the fractures of the market in which it is operating."
"It is not going to attract inward investment from companies and it is not going to be able to prevent the relocations of industries from that economy to other economies where there is more competitiveness or better conditions."
"My last point, which is not often mentioned and which is not paid due recognition, is flexibility - the ability to adapt to changing circumstances."
"Who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first started that the numbers of people in employment in the European Union in the information technology sector would be as high as they are today?"
"Likewise, who would have thought five years ago when this strategy was first implemented that the number of long-term unemployed would still continue to be the same five years later?"
"If anything, we have failed those people who are the most vulnerable - the long-term unemployed - by what we have put in place over the last five years."
"We have failed them, failed to give them the proper tools of knowledge and information to be able to cooperate and deal with the new opportunities that are available."
"When we look at the overall strategy a number of things jump out - colleagues on the other side of the House may disagree with this interpretation, but this is my opinion."
"Firstly, we need to narrow down the guidelines."
"We need to ensure that they provide the ideal focus needed to attack the areas that we recognise as being the most important."
"Secondly, we need to give a longer timespan for the guidelines to work."
"Instead of revising them every year, why not make it every three or four years to ensure again that they can be seen to operate within the mechanisms and systems that they are emerging from?"
"Next, as many speakers have mentioned, there is a need to coordinate the broad economic policies with regard to employment strategy, to ensure that the two match."
"Some people say that there is a tension between these two ideals."
"However, in reality, unless they are working in parallel and in coordination with each other, maximum results will not be achieved, i.e. maximum economic growth and development and maximum employment of those ideals."
"My last point is that we need to continue investing in people, because no matter how many figures and statistics are put before us the bottom line is that we are talking about one single individual person who has lost out on an opportunity within the European Union."
"If, by our discussions here tonight and our work over the next year each of us could get one single person into a quality job we could achieve a lifetime's work because we have helped our fellow human beings to help themselves and they in turn can be the trainers, educators and ambassadors of the future."
"Tomorrow we must give this report a ringing endorsement, but we must also ensure that we do not tie our hands."
"Future ideas must be flexible and able to adapt to the new society."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in implementing the European Employment Strategy, the European Union is seeking to establish the medium-term objectives of full employment, integrated into a context of political coordination, for every Member State."
"Mr Schmid, whom I shall take this opportunity to congratulate, highlights the positive effects and also some of the less successful aspects of the European Employment Strategy in the last five years."
"One of the problems that needs to be resolved is the poor transposition of the Strategy at the decision-making level in the field of employment."
"The open method of coordination is an important instrument for the implementation of this strategy."
"As everyone knows, this was designed for sectors in which the Member States retain their autonomy."
"Differences still remain, however, between national interests and European interests, hence the suggestion that every government should incorporate the national action plan into the development of common policies in the field of employment."
"The active support of the social partners and their contribution to the implementation and the integration of the Strategy's priorities into their annual programmes is particularly relevant in areas such as lifelong learning, active ageing, equality between men and women and the modernisation of the organisation of work."
"Account must also be taken of the consequences of enlargement for the current labour market in the European Union."
"If we are going to be able to improve the current situation between the common global policy at European level and the adoption of policies at national level, adjustments must be made to economic development, by harnessing human resources and creating new institutional structures, but also by strengthening the entrepreneurial spirit."
"In Portugal, the National Employment Plan transposes the content of the Strategy to the Portuguese situation in an attempt to respond to the new challenges."
"In recent years, the Portuguese labour market has generally performed well."
"Structural weaknesses still remain, however, which only a coordinated medium and long-term strategy, with the active participation of the social partners, will enable us to overcome."
"Amongst these weaknesses I would highlight:"
"the low level of training,"
"the significant effects of long-term and extremely long-term unemployment,"
"the existence of a group with special difficulties in rejoining the labour market, comprising young people, older workers, women, ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities,"
"a sectoral and entrepreneurial structure with serious shortcomings,"
"low productivity,"
"considerable regional inequalities."
"Lastly, I should like to emphasise that, in order for economic and national employment policies to be effectively coordinated and coherent, and to guarantee the effective achievement of the European Employment Strategy, the possibilities of the open method of coordination must be improved and exploited, without losing sight of the requirement for this method always to make transparency its top priority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a successful European project which five years ago still had a host of detractors and which has earned the right for its fame to spread beyond a handful of experts."
"Since 1997, around 10 million new jobs have been created."
"This is not enough, in terms of either quantity or quality."
"We agree, however, that the Employment Guidelines need to be made more efficient; they must not be extended, but they need to be more transparent and they ought to have more binding force."
"We do not wish, for the time being in any case, to change the pillar structure."
"However, we do think that it ought to be overhauled."
"In previous years, Parliament has often offered new suggestions with this in mind and also pointed to shortcomings."
"We also want the guidelines actually to be implemented."
"We are aware that some Member States put up so-called passive resistance to the Commission."
"For once this too needs to be clearly stated."
"The assessment of the first and fourth pillars was favourable."
"With your permission, I should like nevertheless to examine this with a more critical eye."
"On the basis of my own experience in the Member States I would say that the first pillar - employability, which deals above all with further education and training - is still far too haphazard, arbitrary and shortsighted."
"We need continuous professional training, and at the end of the day this means employees having a right to further training, and not only when they are 50 or 55 years old, but also when they are only 30 or 35."
"The fourth pillar - equal opportunities - has been warmly praised."
"I believe that the considerable success we have been able to see here is also due to the fact, Commissioner, that equal opportunities policy has been supported on several occasions by anti-discrimination legislation."
"Entrepreneurship and adaptability are still judged to be deficient."
"It seems to me that many employers still have not even realised that they too are expected to show flexibility and make changes."
"The European Social Fund is certainly an effective instrument, but we Europeans should also link it to the fulfilment of certain obligations by the Member States."
"We will probably not be able to manage without European sanctions in the long term."
"Commissioner, my group stands by your side."
"The national employment plans are often still seen as secret government documents, their contents unknown to national Members of Parliament and the public."
"That is why, for the sake of democratic legitimacy, we need codecision at EU level and legislative proposals to provoke debate and decisions at national level."
"As social democrats we will be happy to support you in this quest."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, employment is the key instrument in counteracting social exclusion."
"That is why this is, in my view, such an important item on the EU's agenda."
"I should like to thank Mr Schmid and Mr Mann warmly for the critical eye they have cast over five years of European employment strategy."
"It is of crucial importance to us in Parliament to have our voices heard now, particularly because it is reported that the Commission will be producing a proposal for employment guidelines in 2003."
"I, for my part, should like to make the following observations."
"In its report, the Commission admits unhesitatingly that the European employment strategy cannot take all the credit for the increase in employment over the past couple of years."
"This worries me greatly, because at present, we are clearly heading for a recession, and this is exactly a time when we need an effective strategy."
"If, therefore, it is not clear whether the policy works, is it useful to retain this strategy?"
"The question also arises as to what exactly the European Union's role is."
"Is it a matter of subsidiarity?"
"It is therefore high time sound indicators were developed and the statistics were updated more effectively."
"Only then can we really discern what works and what does not."
"In the meantime, it is a fateful sign that the Court of Auditors will, on Friday, have very critical things to say about the EU's local employment projects in terms of the objectives, how they are monitored, and the inspection of financial resources."
"And then there are women."
"From the Commission communication, it appears that older employees and women still get a rough deal in the area of employment."
"Although over the past five years, employment for women has increased by 4.3% to 54.9% - a very minor increase after all - the jobs involved are mainly part-time and without any real prospects."
"The glass ceiling may have become a little more fragile, but it is still in place."
"However, it is of course completely unacceptable that wage differences still amount to an average of 16%."
"In addition, one of the main headaches for the working woman is combining family with work."
"Although Member States have paid increasing attention to parental leave and childcare over the past few years, I think that more is needed."
"In many Member States, the public is struggling with the notion that the husband can also apply for parental leave."
"The househusband is viewed with suspicion."
"I think it is up to the Union to try to change this."
"In terms of best practices, I believe that a country such as Sweden can certainly be held up as an example."
"Finally, the older employee too is still given too little consideration."
"Lifelong learning often passes them by, while this is, in fact, very important."
"It is extremely important, in my view, to develop a sound, effective and verifiable strategy, certainly in the light of the pending enlargement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the balance-sheet of five years of the European Employment Strategy demonstrates that major shortcomings remain in the creation of quality jobs with rights."
"Most of the jobs created during these years have been precarious, part-time or very short-term, and which fail to guarantee that equal rights and opportunities will be complied with."
"As stated in the report by Herman Schmid, whom I wish to congratulate on his work, unemployment remains at high levels, and long-term unemployment in particular is one of the main causes of social exclusion in Europe, to which we can add precarious and poorly paid work."
"Women are still the worst affected, with average salaries still being considerably lower than those of men, and women still experience considerable difficulty in being promoted to more senior and executive positions."
"The continuance of the restrictive monetary policies of the Stability Pact, the cuts in public investment, the insistence on privatisation, specifically of public services, relegate social and job creation policies to second place, and this is the current situation."
"Priority is still also being given to Community policies in the fields of competition, fisheries and agriculture that fail to take account of small and medium-sized enterprises or family-run smallholdings and of small-scale and coastal fishing, which contribute to exacerbating unemployment and prevent quality employment from being maintained. The same thing is happening with the restructuring and relocation of undertakings, specifically of multinationals, in a flagrant breach of respect for workers' rights."
"It is particularly significant that there is widespread lack of knowledge in the Member States about the European Employment Strategy and that their national plans do not contain quantitative objectives, specifically employment rates for women - as defined at the Lisbon Summit - and nor are these plans being presented in the national parliaments or debates held on their content."
"Account must, therefore, be taken of these issues if we are to achieve positive results in the creation of jobs with rights."
"Mr President, this debate is nearing its end and I think that we are all agreed that the employment strategy has not borne fruit everywhere, or at least not the same fruit."
"But what is important is that all the Member States are starting to change the way they design their national policies, mainly by shifting their priorities from managing unemployment to managing an increase in employment."
"Mr Schmid's report highlights a series of issues which our committee voted in favour of, the purpose of which is to supplement and enhance the Commission communication so as to strengthen this strategy which started in Luxembourg."
"I should like to focus in my speech on a number of issues which other honourable Members have also raised this evening."
"First of all, the involvement of local regional authorities and non-governmental organisations is less than satisfactory."
"The Commissioner referred to local action plans submitted and implemented by local agencies which might set an example, but they are, I think, the exception rather than the rule."
"I think, as Mr Andersson said, that we need to study these examples and find out exactly how and why they benefited some regions and not others."
"I should like to mention something that has happened in my country, which has made me sit up and think."
"Greece is preparing for local and regional elections and absolutely no-one has highlighted the part which local agencies can play in creating jobs."
"Everyone trumpets how important they are in keeping the place clean, creating green spaces, with the odd allusion to social policy for good measure; but never that they can mobilise local forces and create jobs."
"And as for non-governmental organisations, they are even worse off and, unless they are officially involved in social dialogue, local society will not, I fear, look on them as serious, efficient partners."
"Another issue is unemployment among women, which the spokesman for the Committee on Women's Rights, Mr Mann, highlighted. I think that here too, despite the increase in the number of jobs, the Member States need to show serious commitment and consistency in adopting quantitative targets for making qualitative improvements to women's jobs and creating new jobs."
"This relates directly to the issue raised this evening, an issue which I too vigorously endorse, namely the need to coordinate employment policy and social policy."
"It is here that the serious question of creating the conditions needed in order to reconcile work and family life raises its head."
"This is a question of social policy, for which the Member States are responsible; but it is also a question of social responsibility, an issue of concern to the European Parliament and for which the social partners are responsible."
"So, as we can see, huge efforts are needed to ensure that the employment strategy operates at several levels, not forgetting the serious role which national and - where they exist - regional parliaments should play; because employment policy really is an issue to which they have paid scant attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's stocktaking exercise illustrates very clearly how important it has been even to reflect on strategies at European level because, although responsibility for labour market policy lies with the national governments, when it comes to economic policy and social policy it really is time that we recognised that the internal market has contributed to making our national economies interdependent and at the same time to creating interdependent living and working conditions, with the result that we are quite simply compelled, as the European Parliament, as a European institution, also to find an adequate response to this challenge."
"That is why this stocktaking exercise actually does nothing other than invite us to join up procedures even more closely, and to support the Commission's streamlining initiative in economic, employment and social policy so that we gain even better instruments in these fields."
"We have to make it quite clear that we agree that if we wish to respond successfully to the challenges coordination has to be a European task."
"After all, these challenges are greater than ever before when we see that successes in employment are being cancelled out by weak economic growth and that poor labour market figures are in turn dampening growth."
"We must finally get used to the idea that we need to have an economic policy at EU level that also has to meet employment policy objectives, and that we need to pursue a modern EU employment policy that secures sustainable and high-quality growth for everyone."
"This bond needs to be emphasised as we look towards the future."
"I have to say that quite honestly I really hope that the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference will succeed in making a breakthrough in this regard, so as to enshrine the Lisbon process in a constitution, in particular with the aim of full employment."
"Allow me to make three further comments on practical and comprehensive actions which seek actually to increase employment intensity in the European Union and which are in particular also very important from an economic policy point of view."
"Firstly, employment intensity can certainly also be increased further through taxation measures, for example by applying low rates of value-added tax to labour-intensive services."
"It is disappointing that so little progress has been recorded here."
"In addition, it should also be said that initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and small and medium-sized enterprises need to be more closely interlinked than has been possible in the past."
"Thirdly, and this concerns the Employment Guidelines in particular, we should also consider whether we might establish a link with the guidelines in competition policy, that is in policy on state aids, where we of course have specific rules, so as to have exemptions to the ban on state aid when small and medium-sized enterprises are being promoted or jobs created."
"The approaches found there are, however, not necessarily reflected in the Employment Guidelines and the Employment Guidelines are not necessarily reflected in these rules either."
"In my view this is really vital, because aid is also a significant aspect, just as competition policy as a whole is an important policy area for promoting employment."
"Mr President, at a time when unemployment is high in the countries of the European Union, it is vital to draw up a European employment strategy."
"First of all, however, such a strategy should prohibit all large companies from making mass redundancies along the lines of those currently being implemented by the extremely wealthy trust, Alcatel."
"Everyone knows that the responsibility for unemployment lies principally with these large companies, which are not only failing to create the extra jobs they should, but are eliminating jobs purely for the benefit of shareholders."
"Furthermore, any employment strategy should commit the Member States to taking the initiative in creating the hundreds of thousands of jobs lacking in all the Member States of the European Union, in hospitals, the public transport sector, the postal sector, or in education."
"It would also be in society's interests for the Member States to set up large-scale projects to build low-cost, high-quality accommodation."
"The current policy, however, which consists of privatising public sectors left, right and centre, is exactly the opposite."
"Under these conditions, talk about an employment strategy is nothing but pious hopes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank my colleague, the rapporteur, Mr Schmid, and congratulate him on the guidelines he has proposed in his report, with which we largely agree."
"In fact, like many of my fellow Members, I consider that the European employment strategy we have known over the past five years has, to varying degrees, perhaps, depending on the regions, been effective and has benefited the citizens of Europe."
"However, I believe the time has now come to review its structure and also to propose a new strategy that takes full account of the coordination of macro-economic, social and employment policies."
"From this perspective, we have just reviewed every aspect of European employment strategy during the last five years and proposals have been made regarding the guidelines to follow."
"I would like to focus on three points."
"The first point concerns the necessary relationship between the European employment strategy and national employment plans and in this respect, I believe it is a question of the relationship with citizens and the understanding citizens may have of European strategies that affect them."
"In actual fact, this relationship takes place through the intermediary of the national parliaments, both in giving their consent and in implementing the European guidelines."
"In this regard, I believe the situation to be something of a paradox."
"The employment situation is deteriorating."
"The European Union's efforts to set up employment strategies should target people in difficulty."
"However, those who should be able to benefit from the actions are in fact the most disillusioned, the most critical and those who least understand our positions and the proposals we are making."
"I therefore think that if we try to implement a coherent strategy, which fully involves the national parliaments by allowing them to debate national employment plans and make them their own, we will contribute to democratising European procedures, in particular with regard to the European employment strategy, and legitimise our actions in the eyes of the European citizens."
"The second point - on which, I believe, everyone agrees - is that, in order to be effective, the European employment policy should really be an integral part, in socio-economic terms, of European policies."
"The objectives of full employment, education, lifelong learning, all of which have been cited, are in fact parallel objectives which largely fall outside the scope of the guidelines for each sector alone."
"Lastly, in conclusion, I think we need to review the subject of the social instruments used by Europe."
"In fact, even if we reach an agreement on the objectives to be achieved, we still need to provide ourselves with suitable instruments with which to implement them."
"On this subject, I believe we must reconsider using the codecision procedure and majority decision-making with regard to employment policy."
"Although the open coordination method has proved useful, I believe it must be used to complement the other legislative instruments, as was originally intended."
"Mr President, I should like very briefly to thank Parliament and everyone who has contributed to this important debate during the course of the Commission's efforts to present the new, post-evaluation employment policy."
"Serious account will be taken of Parliament's proposals and opinions and I should like to touch on four points which were raised several times this evening."
"The first is the basis on which the employment strategy is being developed."
"It is a combination of competitiveness and cohesion."
"Clearly, the employment strategy takes account of the needs of companies, both large and small, and the needs of the workers."
"The doubt expressed by a number of honourable Members as to the extent to which it fosters competitiveness is, I think, somewhat exaggerated, given that, if nothing else, the employment strategy has resulted in what are also business-friendly job market reforms."
"The need to achieve competitiveness and cohesion at one and the same time means, as several honourable Members have pointed out, that we need to couple employment strategies and policies and social policy; in other words, they cannot be segregated and we need to take account of social policy issues every step of the way."
"The second point is the framework, cooperation, updating the employment guidelines and the financial package."
"Important and serious proposals and approaches have been voiced."
"I would point out, as several honourable Members have said, that the employment strategy needs to be discriminating, its scope needs to be clear and it should not be incorporated into the economic guidelines."
"The third point is involvement."
"One of the basic problems we identified during our evaluation was the involvement of national parliaments, which need to assume a more important role, and of social partners and of local authorities, as regards the regional and local application of the employment strategy."
"Finally, I should like to refer to the method itself as a tool, as Mrs Gillig quite rightly pointed out; a tool which we are using for the first time."
"The open method of coordination has no separate entry in the Treaty; however, it has been a very successful method, which is why we have used it in another two procedures, exclusion and pensions, and we believe that the Intergovernmental Conference will perhaps give us the chance to finalise it and use it more efficiently in other policies."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, this is the second time that social policy and policy on equal opportunities for men and women have been scheduled so late in the day."
"This is acceptable once in a while, but I should nevertheless like to ask those who draft the agenda to switch things around and to schedule economic policy and agricultural policy, for example, this late on the agenda, which would allow us to discuss our reports in the afternoon and prevent Mrs Diamantopoulou and us always having to sit here burning the midnight oil."
"I shall now turn to the report."
"Why has a report been drafted on the representation of women among the social partners?"
"Firstly, because there has been an enormous increase in the number of working women."
"Women constitute 42% of the total workforce in the EU."
"This same increase is not reflected in the bodies that have a say in policy."
"These are the structural bodies of the social partners themselves, their chairmen, their secretaries-general, their executive committees, their general meetings, their negotiation committees, and so on. Women are underrepresented in these."
"Even where social partners function as delegates in advisory bodies, these delegates are very rarely women."
"Despite this, the social partners require - and we grant them this with pleasure - a large proportion of the power in Europe and the Member States, for it is, of course, a fact that the collective labour agreements they conclude, and which therefore also affect women, generally have force of law."
"Indeed, a large proportion of legislative authority, namely that related to labour, has been passed on to them."
"This is permissible, provided that the social partners are representative."
"If they are not, then this is not really tolerable."
"I maintain that they are not representative."
"When, while 42% of women are in the labour market, not even 25% of women are represented in the administrative bodies of the unions, a figure dropping below 12% or 10% in some administrative bodies, and if, for example, employers' organisations have 1% or 2% of women in their administrative bodies, then I maintain that these social partners are not representative of the labour market."
"Hence the report."
"We would therefore ask first and foremost that data be collated and that a database be set up that tracks the presence of women amongst the social partners, for it is extremely difficult, Commissioner, Mr President and fellow MEPs, to obtain these figures."
"This is not too bad for the trade unions since they themselves keep track of these figures to some extent, but this is practically impossible for employers."
"If you were to ask any Member State what the proportion of women is in employers' organisations, you would not get a reply, any figures or data."
"Either this is due to unwillingness, or the data is not available."
"It is therefore essential to set up a database."
"I know that the Commission is in the course of setting this up and that a research mandate has been issued."
"This mandate, however, runs over four years, and I hope, Commissioner, that it will not be four years before steps are taken."
"If we have to wait for the figures, it will be a long time before anything happens."
"In my view, the Commission, the Member States and the social partners must pursue a policy that is similar to that in the political world."
"Fortunately, political parties have gradually been convinced of the fact that the political bodies must be representative of the people in their country."
"If 50% of those people are women, as is the case in all countries - and it is often more - then the political world should be a representation of those women too."
"This is policy both in Europe and in the national Member States."
"The same cannot be said, unfortunately, of the social partners."
"This is why a series of measures is being proposed in this report which must be implemented either by the European Union or the social partners themselves, with a little pressure from the Member States, in order to achieve an acceptable level of representation of women in all negotiating bodies and in the bodies of the social partners, also with the aim of allowing women's issues to be discussed during the negotiations."
"It does indeed speak for itself that those who are around the negotiating table are most sensitive to their own issues; this is always the case."
"This is also normal, for they are most familiar with their own issues."
"This is similar to organising a negotiating table with disabled people; they too would be very sensitive to the issues affecting disabled people, and they would be right."
"This is also true of negotiating tables attended only by men."
"They are very sensitive to their own issues and not so sensitive to those of women."
"Hence our theory."
"I urge you, Commissioner, to adopt a policy that addresses this issue as a whole."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Smet for this report, which shows that very little progress has been made as regards the representation of both sexes among the social partners and that discrimination is alive and kicking."
"It is a disgrace that huge trade union organisations in Europe, with hundreds of thousands of members, do not even have token representation of both sexes and that there are entire trade union executives made up only of men."
"The number of women on the job market has risen but there has hardly been a commensurate increase in the number of women in trade union organisations, where fewer than 25% hold executive positions, even though over 40% belong to a trade union."
"On the employers' side, as Mrs Smet said, the situation is even worse, with the lowest proportion in Belgium, with 1.5%, and the highest in Finland, with just 19%."
"Of course, there has been an increase in the number of working women over recent years, but remember that Beijing concluded ten years ago that, if we continue at this rate, we shall achieve equal numbers in 2500 years."
"So what can we do at European level?"
"Clearly this is not an issue which can be resolved through legislation or binding measures."
"The Commission, as you have already heard, has selected a researcher to monitor statistics and record them throughout Europe, because at present the only records we have are from the national representations; we have no analytical sectoral representation and no breakdown by Member State."
"This statistical exercise will last 4 years, but we shall be able to use the data from year one and it will be especially helpful in finding out where we need to intervene by networking, by exchanging practices, by working together and by giving incentives to trades union."
"The second point is that we need to agree on specific quantitative targets and timetables for the involvement of women."
"The social partners, who are due to present their common agenda at Christmas, intend, as far as I am aware, to include the question of equality as one of the common issues which they will endeavour to resolve over the next few years."
"So if the social partners at European level present a common agenda at Christmas and include the question of gender equality, it is important that we then set specific quantitative targets and timetables."
"The Commission is still aiming for equal representation of men and women at all levels, including in the committees it sets up, but, to tell the truth, few women are involved even in the Commission unions."
"Before I finish my intervention, I should like to point out that the question of the lack of involvement of women, as Mrs Smet has explained, is a question of democracy, it is a question of representation, it is a question of neglecting half the population, neglecting half the force and half the talent of European society."
"We really do believe that, with the employment strategy and social dialogue, we can make progress, but Europe cannot push ahead alone if the social partners themselves fail to assume a large part of the responsibility, which is why we also need their initiative here."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mrs Smet on her own-initiative report and for highlighting an issue which has been more or less forgotten at both European and national level."
"It is true that we have little information on the under-representation of women in social partner structures and on their lack of involvement in social dialogue negotiations."
"It is also true that this deficit, this problem, is not acknowledged in political circles."
"In fact, while we often hear about the absence of women from parliaments, from governments, from local and regional authorities, we rarely hear about the absence of women among the social partners."
"So we too need persuading, as European institutions, as national governments and as social partners, that the involvement of women in decision-making procedures within the social partnership will not merely add credentials to their authority and quality to democracy; it will also, in the final analysis, promote our development objectives, since it will help increase employment, improve the quality of work and increase productivity and competitiveness."
"As far as the involvement of women in decision-making processes is concerned, it is the only opportunity to take account of the demands of women, both employed and unemployed, to develop social responsibility for the benefit of working women, to create the conditions needed to develop creativity in the workplace, to take account of specifically female aspects and to deal with wage differentials, which is the most basic problem of all."
"So we need a broad information and awareness-raising campaign in every direction and to motivate working women themselves, because they too must take their share of the responsibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, although the European institutions have in various documents highlighted the need for a more balanced and proportional representation of women in the various decision-making structures and political and social bodies, also where the social partners are concerned, the fact is that profound imbalances and enormous inequalities still remain, as Mrs Smet's report points out, and as Commissioner Diamantopoulou confirmed a short while ago."
"And although where the social partners are concerned only incomplete information is available, the meagre data available on the participation of women demonstrate that at executive level, the percentage of women is low, with women being clearly under-represented in the upper echelons of organisations, which weakens democracy and makes it difficult to achieve real equality of rights and opportunities, which we incorporated into the Treaties and into various Directives to which we refer on a daily basis."
"We therefore support the initiatives proposed in this report, both those that seek to obtain a greater knowledge of the current situation (and the need for data collection has already been mentioned here), and those intended to achieve a more balanced representation of men and women among the social partners."
"We call for timetabled performance targets to be established - on the quantitative and qualitative representation of women, both in internal decision-making structures and in collective bargaining, including at the forthcoming trilateral social summit - and I now wish to draw the Commissioner's attention to this matter - and also for reports to be drafted on the progress made and the impact of the measures adopted."
"Objective conditions must be established, however, to ensure that the participation of women in the social and political bodies becomes a reality."
"The Commission must also create a database and good practices must be disseminated, including in the joint report on employment, sharing information on the participation of women, and specifically in collective bargaining, and also on the progress made in the field of equal opportunities."
"This information, this analysis and this approach must be formalised in the various reports on the social sphere and on employment."
"Mr President, in all of the European Union's Equal Opportunities Action Programmes, for example the Fifth Action Programme for 2001 to 2005, great importance is attached to there being balanced representation of men and women in decision-making bodies."
"While good statistics are available in parliaments and national institutions, there are still not any satisfactory surveys of the social partners."
"In both the unions and the employers' organisations women in leadership roles are in a tiny minority."
"There is no doubt that this needs to be changed, but please not at a snail's pace."
"In the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, we have unanimously called on the social partners to set precise targets as soon as possible with a view to improving the quantitative and qualitative representation of women."
"As part of this, deadlines should be agreed for their implementation."
"Databases should be created so as finally to provide a precise overview of female representation in expert fora and decision-making bodies."
"A further long overdue measure is the creation of posts for equal opportunities officers in all of the Member States."
"Whenever change is initiated, however, intensive awareness-raising is required."
"In training courses and at conferences on gender mainstreaming, women's structures in the social partners should be visible."
"Positive measures need to be developed in the form of action programmes within organisations."
"Women's networks should be created and should communicate with each other."
"They should exchange experiences and pass on information about projects to each other."
"These projects were successful and are therefore worth replicating and the others failed and we should try to understand what we can learn from them."
"An important component is responsibility at executive level right up to the boardroom."
"There are therefore sufficient reasons for drawing up this own-initiative report."
"The vote in the Women's Rights Committee was unanimous and is testimony to the exemplary work of our rapporteur, Miet Smet."
"I too can fully endorse this assessment of her report."
"Mr President, the most striking statistic I have heard tonight is the one from the Commissioner when she indicated that it would take 2 500 years for us to reach a position of equality for women if we continue at the same pace."
"I wonder how much faster we need to move in order to achieve this equality within the next hundred years, which even then would be quite a long period to have to wait."
"It strikes me that while we talk consistently, and correctly, about the need to create equal opportunities in the European Union that in a very real sense that is a secondary objective to treating people with equality, because there is a distinct difference between the question of equality for every single human being and the idea that they should also have equal opportunities."
"Without equality there can be no equal opportunity and that has to be fundamental to our approach to this issue of women participating in decision-making."
"One of the issues that must be addressed if we are to ensure that women - and in particular working women - can participate and that they get time off work in order to pursue trade union activities, is that of employers being extremely reluctant to allow workers to have time off to pursue either training or trade union activities."
"This is increasingly the case, even before one deals with the question of allowing either men or women time off to have babies or to look after children."
"I am not surprised by the statistic which indicates that there has been a decline in the number of women participating in employers' organisations."
"The only slight criticism I would have of some of the statistics in the report is that they are out of date."
"That is not the fault of the rapporteur, it is down to the fact that we do not have consistent and systematic collection of proper data."
"One of the keys to making progress in this area is to have affirmative programmes, action plans and targets."
"Critical to it also is a programme of sensitising people in trade unions and in employers' organisations to the fact that there is another half of the human race who are entitled to equality as of right and not just as a privilege."
"Mr President, the only point of the fallacious symmetry established between the under-representation of women in managerial organisations, on the one hand, and trade unions, on the other, is to show that there are still far fewer women in managerial organisations than in trade unions, even though managers face no material obstacles to this other than the misogyny of the managerial environment."
"On the other hand, it would be extremely cynical to reproach workers' organisations for not including women in their number, when female workers throughout the European Union have the problem of insufficient or non-existent crèches and nursery schools."
"As the rapporteur is a former minister, she would be better advised to use her influence to encourage the Member States to implement an extensive programme for the creation of crèches, day nurseries and nursery schools, employing a sufficient number of staff."
"That would certainly not solve the problems of female representation in the managerial bodies of trade unions, but it would create better conditions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this excellent report, Mrs Smet, whom I congratulate on her magnificent work, highlights the insufficient participation of women among the social partners in the European Union and the consequences of this for the implementation of equal opportunities policy."
"In order to remedy the glaringly obvious shortfall in the representation of women in the decision-making structures and bodies of the social partners, three measures, in particular, are to be emphasised."
"First: we need to know where we are now and where we want to be."
"Hence the need to ensure that we have statistics that give us a true picture of the situation and which can provide a basis for the creation of action programmes and the drafting of evaluation reports;"
"Second: knowledge and training are the keys to individual and collective progress."
"The preparation of women for leadership duties must, therefore, be a priority."
"This aim can best be achieved through the creation of centres for the dissemination of specialist knowledge."
"Third: the social partners must provide training actions to raise awareness of equal opportunities and this issue must always feature on the negotiating agenda."
"In my country, for example, the rate of women in employment has been steadily increasing and is one of the highest in the European Union."
"Nevertheless, such changes are not matched by the level of women's participation in the decision-making processes and many inequalities still persist."
"With regard to access to executive positions, only 2% of women occupy the posts of departmental heads and managers, which rises to 3.2% at more senior levels."
"We are also seeing the insufficient participation of women in positions of greater responsibility in union life."
"Reliable data are difficult to come by, as has already been stated here several times."
"Lastly, I wish to remind you that various studies confirm that the presence of women in decision-making bodies and in collective bargaining has a very positive impact on the implementation of equal opportunities policy."
"Therefore, the balanced representation of men and women, apart from being a democratic imperative for the social partners, will lead to a more favourable working and organisational environment."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Bastos."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.48 p.m.)"
". (PT) I wish to express my agreement with this recommendation for second reading and with the consequent adoption of the Council common position, which I believe is of crucial importance to the promotion of road safety."
"As advocated by Mr Hatzidakis, whom I shall take this opportunity to congratulate on his excellent work, increasing road safety by limiting the speed of the vehicles used in both passenger and freight transport, is to be welcomed."
"The Commission's proposal to extend the scope of the directive in force - Directive 92/6/EEC - and the phased installation of speed limitation devices reflects a constant concern of Parliament, which is the promotion of road safety in the European Union, to which I have always subscribed and which I continue to call for."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to adopt the Council common position as rapidly as possible and without amendments, given that most of the amendments tabled by Parliament have been taken into account, whilst new elements have also been incorporated, which have helped to improve the clarity of the text under our consideration."
"Tourism and the way in which travel agencies operate has changed dramatically in the last 25 years, following the adoption of the special VAT arrangements for this sector."
"At the same time, the activity of travel agencies has undergone a profound change."
"The special arrangements defined in the sixth Directive are finding it increasingly difficult to match the current needs of this sector."
"The myriad derogations from which various EU countries benefit and the privileged situation of third-country travel agencies with regard to VAT has led to unfair competition or to the practice of the most powerful companies setting up branches in third countries - Switzerland, for example - in order to avoid their tax obligations to the European Community."
"The Commission proposal warrants our vote."
"I therefore propose a practical method of collecting VAT imposed on third-country travel agencies that sell products in the European Union or to individuals resident in the Community; the same method, in fact, that Parliament adopted for electronic commerce."
"I also propose a method of improving the competitiveness of travel agencies when selling tourism products within the Union to residents of third countries."
". (PT) My vote against the report does not overlook the fact that the Laeken Summit of December 2001 reaffirmed the need for the EU's Member States to adopt a common policy in the field of asylum and immigration by 2004."
"I am actually sensitive to the need for coordination procedures to be established in the field of asylum policy and even, for the sovereignty and the competences of the Member States to be respected, with regard to the permanent incorporation of a method of coordination in the field of asylum in order to encourage the convergence of national systems."
"I am not indulging in hyperbole, however - especially in an extremely sensitive area such as this - and I regret the fact that both the rapporteur and the specialist committee have opted for a hyperbolic and frankly excessive approach, which goes far beyond what is necessary."
"This is why I voted against the report."
"And ultimately, this is the underlying reason for my final rejection of the report, which should serve as a warning for the future: in striving to achieve too much, the basic needs may suffer."
"This budget is simultaneously delightful, detrimental and disastrous."
"Delightful because of the amount: EUR 100 billion."
"This is the highest budget we have seen since 1958."
"Detrimental with regard to agriculture."
"The percentage of agricultural appropriations in spending as a whole is being relentlessly eroded and, in particular, the appropriations authorised in financial forecasts are never used to the full."
"Over ten years, if we add up the annual differences between the agricultural budgets implemented, on the one hand, and the agricultural budgets voted for and the estimated agricultural financial forecasts, on the other, the equivalent of an annual agricultural budget has been spirited away."
"The EUR 40 or so billion that have been stolen from European farmers could have been used to save our apiarists, promote our wines and create a European fund against natural disasters."
"In the Languedoc area, for example, where flooding in September destroyed 4000 hectares of vineyards."
"Disastrous, because 2003 will be the last year before we jump into the bottomless pit of globalisation without a safety net."
"It is the year of Cancun and the WTO Ministerial Conference that will seal the world agreement on agricultural free trade."
"It is also the year in which there will be real conflict over the CAP review, with a powerful ally for Mr Fischler in Renate Kunas."
"It is also the beginning of our descent down the slippery slope of enlargement, with the accession of the Eastern European agricultural countries bringing unknown costs in real terms."
"Outcome of World Summit on Sustainable Development"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development;"
"report (A5-0237/2002) by Mrs Hulthén, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission communication on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme [COM(2001) 580 - C5-0164/2002 - 2002/2072(COS)]."
"In opening this debate, I am pleased to be able to give the floor to President Haarder, formerly one of our fellow Members and Vice-President of the European Parliament, who will now speak on behalf of the Council as President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr President, we welcome this opportunity to present the Commission's assessment of the outcome of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg concluded three weeks ago."
"It is in a way rather early to make a definitive assessment of the outcome."
"Time and our own committed efforts will tell if this summit will deliver where Rio de Janeiro did not."
"As we said repeatedly at the end of the negotiations, we have the words and it is now the duty of all of us to turn these words into effective deeds."
"I will not over-simplify and try to sum up the summit in one word as either a success or a failure, but overall the Commission believes that we can be satisfied with the results of Johannesburg."
"We succeeded in adding new momentum to the cause of sustainable development and the outcomes of the summit take us in the right direction."
"Of course people will draw comparisons with the Rio Earth Summit of 1992."
"The immediate assessment of some NGOs and others in the period after Rio was that it had been a failure."
"Now it has come to be seen as a defining moment in the fight for sustainable development."
"The Rio Summit was very different from Johannesburg in some important respects."
"Most importantly, the political climate in 2002 is very different from ten years ago."
"Against a difficult political backdrop it fell largely to the European Union to champion the cause of sustainable development in Johannesburg."
"We were, you might say, almost the only engine in this whole process."
"Let me remind you of how the European mandate was determined."
"In preparing for the summit, the Commission issued two specific communications, one in February 2001 entitled 'Ten years after Rio: preparing for the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002' and a second communication in February 2002 entitled: 'Towards a global partnership for sustainable development'."
"Building upon these communications the Council adopted several sets of conclusions in 2001 and 2002 in which the European Union's negotiating platform for the World Summit on Sustainable Development was defined."
"It is worth noting specifically the Development Council conclusions of 30 May 2002, which list in detail the EU's priorities."
"The European Parliament also issued its opinion in a resolution adopted on 16 May 2002."
"In substantive terms, we worked to undertake further steps towards the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by 2015."
"Poverty eradication was the over-arching theme to which we linked all the concrete issues. The Union argued that we had to show real commitment by setting quantifiable targets, with timetables and monitoring mechanisms, in the Implementation Plan."
"Let me now focus in particular on some key achievements reached in Johannesburg, which Mr Haarder has already mentioned, but which I think are worth noting again."
"The first element I would like to highlight is that a set of new targets has been agreed as part of the Implementation Plan."
"I will mention five."
"First, halving by 2015 the proportion of people lacking access to basic sanitation - this currently stands at three billion people, half of the total world population."
"This new target complements the Millennium Development Goal on access to clean water."
"Second, a commitment to minimise harmful effects on human health and the environment from the production and use of all chemicals by 2020."
"Third, a commitment to halt the decline of fish stocks and restore them to sustainable levels no later than 2015."
"Fourth, a commitment to begin implementation of national strategies on sustainable development by 2005."
"Fifth, a commitment to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010, as earlier agreed by the parties to the Biodiversity Convention."
"The endorsement by all Heads of State and Government is a major achievement."
"The agreement to establish a ten-year framework for programmes on sustainable consumption and production, with industrialised countries taking the lead in this global effort, is another important result."
"On globalisation, as has been said, the summit agreed on concrete actions to enhance the role of trade for sustainable development, for example by encouraging trade in environmentally friendly and organic products from developing countries and by strengthening international action for corporate responsibility."
"The EU's objectives on energy were addressed in the Council Presidency Conclusions of 30 May 2002, in which the EU reaffirmed its commitment to facilitating the achievement of the millennium development goal of halving the number of people in extreme poverty, and other millennium development goals, by 2015, through the provision of adequate, affordable and sustainable energy services."
"In line with its general position in favour of a focused and result-oriented implementation plan, the European Union also supported, among other things, the establishment of a quantitative, time-bound target to increase the proportion of renewable energy within the overall energy mix."
"Although we were ultimately not able to get a specific target for renewable energy sources in the Action Plan, we did reach an agreement to increase urgently and substantially the global share of renewable energy sources."
"We also agreed to take joint actions to improve the access of the poor to energy."
"Those agreements will be regularly evaluated and their progress reviewed."
"In addition, the European Union launched a 'coalition of the willing' on renewable energy."
"This includes countries and regions willing to set themselves targets and timeframes for the increase of renewables in the energy mix."
"This coalition maintains pressure on the unwilling, and should give a boost to the development of renewable energy throughout the world."
"Significantly, this coalition will set a renewable energy target representing a floor as opposed to a ceiling."
"Linked to this, there have been positive developments on climate change."
"Those who have already ratified Kyoto have confirmed their commitment to entry into force at the earliest possible date and others are urged to join as soon as possible."
"The announcements made by Poland, as well as by the Russian and Canadian Prime Ministers, mean that the Protocol should enter into force very soon."
"The European Commission spoke with one strong voice in Johannesburg."
"As Commissioner for the Environment, I shared with Poul Nielson (Commissioner for Development) the responsibility as chef de file in the preparations for Johannesburg."
"We both participated in the high-level negotiation sessions at ministerial level at the WSSD Summit."
"Coordination was further enhanced by the presence in Johannesburg of the President of the Commission."
"I am now pleased to hand over to my colleague Poul Nielson who will speak, amongst other things, about the need for follow-up and implementation of our WSSD commitments."
"Mr President, Mrs Wallström has correctly said that I will be talking more specifically about trade, finance and follow-up, but first a few general remarks."
"One needs to keep in mind that Johannesburg was a UN conference."
"This means delegations must reach consensus."
"Not everybody gets everything."
"As Commissioner Wallström said, we are in a different political climate than in 1992."
"It is almost as if NGOs and the Group of 77 had given up expecting constructive multilateralism from the United States; as if the US is not part of the equation for sustainable development."
"That attitude is not possible in the negotiation rooms, where the US, of course, is a real player, as we could see when the US and OPEC members joined forces in resisting targets on renewable energy."
"But Johannesburg did result in consensus, and that in itself is positive."
"Let me address trade issues in more detail."
"I have noted some concerns here."
"The negotiations were indeed difficult."
"Developing countries focused on trade and on subsidies in agriculture."
"This forced the EU to put in a strong effort to safeguard Doha as the place to discuss the substance and to avoid, in general, a derailing of the multilateral agenda."
"I have noted point 6 in the motion for a resolution, and I would like to point out that I think this is a correct reading of this problem."
"We succeeded in avoiding this derailing of the multilateral agenda, but of course we had to use up negotiation capital defending what everybody had in fact internationally agreed less than a year ago."
"What is very encouraging - and you could call this 'EU leadership' - is that we avoided a repetition of the disorganised 'agenda overload' that was in fact the cause of the breakdown in Seattle."
"When NGOs say that Johannesburg was a failure because it didn't reopen Doha and Monterrey, this is a self-constructed and unnecessary misunderstanding of what Johannesburg was about."
"The fact that some MEPs seem to share this misunderstanding does not help much."
"Doha dealt with trade in November 2001."
"Monterrey dealt with financing in March 2002."
"This helped Johannesburg succeed."
"The multilateral agenda was better organised for Johannesburg."
"This enabled us - despite the difficulties I mentioned - to focus in the end-game on the core issues of the Johannesburg Summit."
"The EU will continue to promote its positive agenda on trade for the benefit of developing countries."
"There are plenty of things to report here:"
"First, we are ahead of other major trading partners on market access, thanks in particular to 'Everything But Arms'."
"Second, on Friday, the EU and the ACP countries launch negotiations on Regional Economic Partnership Agreements under the Cotonou Agreement."
"I can go into more detail if you have questions about this."
"Third, last week, the Commission adopted a communication on trade and development, addressed to Council and to this Parliament."
"It sets out what needs to be done to help developing partners benefit from national, regional and global trade."
"It responds, within less than a month, to the Johannesburg Political Declaration and the call for increased Trade-Related Assistance."
"The relevant Doha provisions are quoted throughout the text."
"The Johannesburg text also calls for the successful completion of the Doha Agenda, placing the needs of developing countries at the heart of negotiations, but without interfering with its negotiations on subsidies and tariffs."
"On subsidies, the Johannesburg text directly quotes the Council's conclusions."
"The text also reaffirms the text on access to medicines and TRIPs."
"In short, the Johannesburg text on trade and finance is in line with the mandate given by the Development Council on 30 May."
"That is not a bad result."
"The message from southern delegations was nevertheless loud and clear: 'The North must show that it is serious about Doha being a development round'."
"That is a rather useful reminder which we, from the Commission side, welcome and find meaningful."
"Regarding finances, Johannesburg fully reconfirmed the millennium development goals, also adding a few new, important targets."
"Sustainable development remains the core objective of the Johannesburg political declaration, and this gives us a coherent framework for implementing the outcome of all major UN conferences."
"The fight against poverty was given high priority throughout the chapters of the Plan of Implementation."
"It is a step forward that the summit explicitly prioritised fighting poverty in pursuing targets such as access to energy, water and sanitation, and equitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity."
"We therefore have sound, common yardsticks for whether the community of nations is doing enough."
"The agreed language on finance ensures a dynamic post-Monterrey process, thereby maintaining the pressure for more ODA."
"You will not be surprised to hear, however, that I think donors should be doing a lot more."
"If you want concrete answers as to where the EU is going, you should look at 2003 fiscal budgets for each of the EU Member States."
"That is what I will do."
"Regarding the role of the European Parliament - there has been some debate on the role of Members of this Parliament at the summit, and on collaboration with the Commission."
"Since some of these remarks have been made in public, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly react."
"The Commission was pleased to accept a substantial presence from the Parliament in the Union's delegation, as has been the case for all major UN conferences."
"Members followed the summit actively and interacted with the Commission in briefings, summit events, side-events and so on, all in the interests of representing Europe."
"As agreed between the institutions, Members of Parliament participated in delegations as observers and did not take part in negotiating sessions."
"There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg."
"I think I should repeat this."
"There was no deviation from established practice in Johannesburg."
"The Commission did its best to support the parliamentarians."
"They were kept regularly informed of negotiations, and the Commission listened carefully to their views."
"Debriefing meetings were held on a daily basis by senior Commission officials."
"This demonstrates the importance we gave to a transparent flow of information."
"Both Commissioner Wallström and I participated in this process, and I personally met the Parliament delegation three times during the summit, not to mention the Parliamentary side-events I attended, including two events organised by the Green party."
"All of this was done within the current framework, a framework referred to explicitly in President Prodi's letter agreeing to parliamentary participation."
"I pointed out to Members of Parliament raising this issue in Johannesburg during the summit, as I had to, that we had not come there with new rules and that it was not in our power in Johannesburg to change these arrangements."
"Any such changes require a tripartite decision involving the Commission, Council and European Parliament."
"If being a loyal custodian of what has been agreed to makes one ancient, I prefer that, rather than trying to be modern if that means not being able to respect what has been agreed to."
"Now a few words on follow-up."
"Partnerships between governments, business and civil society will be necessary to deliver the commitments made in Johannesburg."
"We welcome the more than 200 partnerships launched at the summit."
"These partnerships will hopefully bring additional resources and expertise, and mobilise action at all levels."
"But it is the quality and size of the partnerships that matter, not the numbers as such."
"The Cotonou Agreement is 'only' one partnership, but it covers 15 EU Member States, 77 developing countries, and has a financial protocol of EUR 15.2 billion."
"We are not starting from scratch."
"The European Commission will focus on securing strong EU implementation of the two EU-wide partnerships on water and energy launched in Johannesburg."
"During the summit, the EU signed with its African partners a strategic EU-Africa partnership on water and sanitation."
"In conjunction with the EU Water Initiative, this is an important step towards the development of concrete actions building on strong ownership and commitment from African partners."
"More generally, it is clear that the effective implementation of the outcome of Johannesburg means translating intentions into action through development cooperation undertaken regionally and nationally as well as locally."
"The EU must continue to take the lead."
"The European Council has already agreed to review, at its Spring meeting in 2003, the EU strategy for sustainable development, with a focus on putting into practice the commitments undertaken in Johannesburg."
"To prepare this review, the Commission intends to submit proposals building on the communication 'Towards a Global Partnership for Sustainable Development' issued earlier this year."
"Internally, one of the main issues to be addressed in the synthesis report for next Spring's European Council should be how to move towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns in the EU."
"I would conclude by saying that the European Union can be satisfied with the role it played in Johannesburg; and by stressing 'European Union'."
"The cooperation between Commission and Council was also a very positive experience."
"The EU clearly came with the longest wish list."
"But of course, the higher the level of ambition, the greater the scope for disappointment."
"NGOs and the press focus on these shortcomings."
"So be it."
"But as responsible politicians, we must be careful not to draw the conclusion that we, for this reason, should be less ambitious in the future."
"The Commission does not believe the EU - and indeed the world - can afford to be less ambitious."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Danish Presidency and the Commission."
"I want to begin in a positive mood and say that I fully agree with the Commission and the Council that we should not be too critical and negative about the result of the Johannesburg Summit."
"It is not possible to measure the gain that nonetheless results when we see that more people have access to water, proper sanitation, food and an environment with fewer chemicals."
"I think that we should say that this really is a gain and that we should share the credit together, for, had it not been for the European Union, I think that we never would have got as far as we did in Johannesburg."
"This is also perhaps where part of Parliament's frustration lies."
"Ever since the period before the Gothenburg Summit, we in Parliament have worked actively for sustainable development."
"Many have compared our wish list to some sort of Christmas tree with an overabundance of decorations."
"We have nonetheless been agreed on the requirements and on the process we wanted the Union to implement in order to make the necessary changes."
"Our frustration stems from the fact that we can see that the results have not yet been achieved."
"If our wish list is considered to be an over-decorated Christmas tree, then one could well say that the result from Johannesburg is more like a Christmas tree with no needles - but nevertheless a Christmas tree."
"Our frustration also expresses itself when we are not able to make use of our abilities and our knowledge at summits."
"I still think that this message is one that the Commission should take note of."
"It is a matter of the attitude between Parliament and the Commission."
"This fact is, however, worthy of a much smaller degree of frustration than the situation we actually ought to be frustrated about, that is, the situation the world finds itself in."
"This is the problem we really ought to discuss today."
"The problems that might exist between Parliament and the Commission as to who should say what at the international meetings can be taken up in a forum other than this Chamber, and we should now concentrate on the problem that we actually need to do something about."
"It is good that there is emphasis on us now having to start on the real work."
"We must ensure that the commitments and promises that the EU made in Johannesburg now find expression in our actual policies and that they are visible in our budget."
"I should like both the Council and the Commission to return to Parliament in February to report on what has been done up to then and what will happen in future so that the commitments from Johannesburg can be implemented."
"In this connection, I will naturally emphasise aid."
"The Member States fall embarrassingly short of the standard when it comes to international aid."
"There are few who actually come up to it."
"I would also like to say a few words about the other commitments that the EU has made, for example at Kyoto, and about how things are looking with our own climate programme, which the Commission approved about a year ago, a two-year programme that comprises one half of the strategy to combat climate change within Europe."
"We come back to the other half, the trade in emission quotas, in October through Mr Moreira da Silva."
"It is a pity that we cannot also discuss emission quotas in this context, but I will, however, say something about the report that the Commission published about one year ago."
"We have made good progress with what the Commission has put forward, but the Commission's programme is lacking a great many important parts."
"Agriculture policy, for example, is still not included, but this could perhaps be included in the programme now since one year has passed."
"With regard to our targets and the 8% reduction we want to achieve, the principle must still be that climate policy should form the basis of energy policy."
"This should govern the formulation of our energy policy in future."
"We must ensure that this is expressed in our research programmes and in the directives that the Commission has promised, such as the directive on public procurement with regard to energy."
"Transport remains the biggest problem."
"There are no good solutions, a fact that could be described as embarrassing."
"Less embarrassing are the local examples."
"The car-free day all over Europe on Sunday is witness to an enormous commitment of a kind that we should make much more often than we have in the past."
"Mr President, I speak in my capacity as draftsman of the opinion on the European Climate Change Programme."
"Commissioner Nielson, I was astonished by the self-satisfaction you radiated during your contribution on the outcome of Johannesburg."
"There is little evidence to justify it, and your abuse of the press is of no use and makes no difference."
"I wish to speak on the Climate Change Programme, and with specific reference to the ten of its forty-two points that are to be implemented over the coming two years."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has welcomed this programme as a whole, as we take the view that it is not enough for measures to be taken by the Member States alone."
"There can, though, be no doubt that responsibility for adherence to the climate change objectives rests primarily with the states that signed the Kyoto Protocol, that is, with the Member States of the European Union, that burden sharing is a voluntary agreement within the European Union, and that the measures proposed by the Commission and supported by Parliament must not be allowed to frustrate these objectives."
"That is why the Committee on Industry takes the view that what matters in evaluating the measures is that the most efficient and cost-effective should be taken first."
"It is, then, about not providing just for any old measures that cost a lot of money and put the European Union's industrial competitiveness at risk, but rather about making a start where everything can be put into effect as quickly as possible."
"There are, as yet, few proposals on how to go about this."
"Two have been received, one on biofuels, which are the right thing but expensive, and another on emissions trading, on which latter subject the Committee on Industry has made an emphatic call for a voluntary pilot stage up to 2008, and for such trading not to be enforced before that date."
"It is my belief that this objective and these considerations have to be looked at from the point of view of industry policy."
"I have been preceded on the floor by four speakers from the Scandinavian states."
"I believe it to be the common responsibility of us all not to lose sight of our industrial policy objectives and our economy's competitiveness, no matter how necessary it is that we support to the utmost a sensible European climate change programme."
"Mr President, I am going to speak about the Johannesburg Summit."
"With regard to the Hulthén report, my colleague, Peter Liese, will address this issue."
"Unlike what many tried to do, and which amounted to condemning the summit to failure even before it began, Parliament set out for Johannesburg with considerable ambition: in other words, we did not join in with the cynical approach of those who sought to lower expectations before setting off in order to be able then to make small victories appear to be major ones."
"We adopted this approach for two reasons: first, because this is what the world required."
"The world is in a state of emergency, in both the environmental and the social fields, and so achieving a merely reasonable result at the summit was not acceptable to this Parliament."
"Second, because this was an opportunity that did not arise ten years ago and which will not arise in the next few years."
"It would, therefore, have been a tragic mistake not to take advantage of this opportunity."
"We set out, then, with considerable ambition and with a great spirit of unity and of solidarity between all the political groups."
"And at the end of the summit, I must say that although we moved in the right direction and we went further than Rio, we achieved less than what was needed."
"Admittedly, some results were achieved, but these are by no means sufficient to reverse the signs of unsustainability afflicting the planet."
"On the positive side, in addition to what the Danish Presidency and the Commission have highlighted in terms of timetables and targets, specifically for poverty, water and health, I would highlight as equally positive the change in the character of the summit."
"Whereas in Rio we did not get beyond the concept of sustainable development, Johannesburg was associated with action."
"The nature of the summit took a qualitative leap forwards."
"Secondly, a qualitative leap was also taken in terms of concepts: sustainable development made a very close link between the environment and poverty."
"And I think that another qualitative leap was the desire to eradicate poverty and, at the same time, to put a brake on environmental degradation."
"Thirdly, in terms of the actors: reversing unsustainability stopped being an obligation of nations, of states alone."
"With the huge number of partnerships approved, the participation of civil society has been guaranteed."
"Both the public and private sectors are committed to this objective of sustainable development."
"On the negative side, it was obviously a disappointment that no quantified targets were set for renewable energies or for reversing lost biodiversity."
"I would, however, add a point not mentioned either by the Danish Presidency, or by the Commission, and which I believe is negative: it is the fact that no boost was given to institutional reform in the field of the environment."
"This summit could have been used to ensure the 'greening' of the existing institutions, such as the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, but also to launch new institutions that place globalisation at the service of sustainable development."
"I am thinking, for example, of a World Environment Organisation."
"This issue was not mentioned or discussed, and played no part in the summit, and this was deplorable."
"I have one last thing to say, also on the negative side, with regard to Kyoto. Many people have placed Kyoto on the positive side of the balance-sheet of this summit."
"I would put it on the negative side."
"It is true that Russia, Canada, India and China made very fine declarations with regard to the future."
"What was expected of this summit, however, was not declarations or intentions about Kyoto: what was hoped for was for the summit to lead to the practical implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"And ten years after the Rio Summit, Kyoto has still not begun to exist in practice."
"I wish to say one last thing about the role of Parliament and our relationship with the Commission and with the Council."
"We tend, at these summits, to praise the Commission and to criticise the Council."
"This time, things were reversed: our relationship with the Danish Presidency was excellent, transparent, highly cooperative and, unfortunately, this time, with the Commission, we did not see the same level of cooperation that we have grown accustomed to at the conferences on climate change with Commissioner Wallström."
"We have always enjoyed excellent cooperation at the summits on climate change."
"Unfortunately, this time there was neither transparency, nor cooperation, nor sufficient collaboration."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Johannesburg was indeed a summit at which it was no longer the fine and already so often enunciated words that mattered, but the commitment to definite actions."
"I believe that this was also timely, as what we know to be necessary has long been an item on the agenda."
"If it is the worldwide acceptance of sustainable development that we are about, then it goes without saying that this involves the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of social cohesion in many countries of the world, that being the foundation stone for sustainable development and for environmentally responsible behaviour."
"So it is that I find it all the more regrettable that the current American administration behaves as it does, making use of every tactical evasive trick in an attempt to forestall definite commitments with the ultimate aim of causing its own economic interests to prevail."
"I believe that this has to be said with the utmost clarity, especially in the light of how the European Union, the driving force behind this summit, tried to get the right questions onto the agenda and also to get to grips with the right targets for implementing sustainable development."
"This has, unfortunately, been only partly successful, mainly because the world's largest industrial state blocked it."
"The EU provided the driving force and indicated the right way to go, notably on issues of water supply, sanitation and environmentally friendly production."
"I also found the daily discussions with the Commission good and appropriate, and am also grateful to the Presidency of the Council for, on three occasions, having very in-depth discussions with the Parliamentary delegation, although it is still Parliament's demand that the leader of the delegation at least should take part in the EU coordination meeting tomorrow and be able to observe and comment on the actual negotiating processes."
"If, however, you point the finger at the right issues, three fingers are generally pointing back at you, and that is also true on this issue of sustainable development."
"One of these fingers is our agricultural policy."
"How, indeed, can we go on the offensive in demanding changes in production worldwide if our agricultural policies and subsidies stand in the way of fair dealing, if our agricultural subsidies are many times in excess of what we give as development aid?"
"Second finger: what about a system of fair trade for the world?"
"To judge by the situation that coffee growers currently find themselves in, there is a need for bold revision of the trading system and also of the international financial flows, which have to aim at fair investments rather than the maximisation of short-term profit."
"The third finger, without a doubt, points to the issue of sustainable policies in our own activities."
"How successful are we in fact in pointing the European Union's transport systems and private households towards sustainability?"
"We will have credibility in the eyes of the world only when we ourselves can make it clear that what we demand of others we also put into practice ourselves."
"That is why the climate change programme that we are discussing today is an important building block towards combining environmental policy channels with economic performance and social justice."
"Mr President, at the close of the Johannesburg Summit, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, stated that this type of conference cannot be expected to produce miracles."
"I must add that the results of previous conferences, Rome and Monterrey, to be specific, did not give rise to such expectations either."
"We agree, however, that it is legitimate to expect more than what was achieved."
"And, basically, considerably more was needed."
"Obviously, we do not wish to play down some of the objectives that were sketched out and also some of the time targets that were adopted, particularly in terms of access to drinking water and to basic sanitation, in terms of the use and production of chemical products or the recovery of fish stocks. Not to mention other objectives which had been previously enshrined and which have now been reaffirmed."
"However, and at the same time, we cannot ignore or gloss over the clear failures seen in other fields, specifically in the field of renewable energies, to which the European Union has been so committed, but in which the results fell far short of our expectations."
"Furthermore, we must bear in mind that the means and even the commitment crucial to realising the objectives adopted remained largely undefined, especially if we take account of the deadlines that were set."
"Despite the fact that, as has been mentioned, some new objectives were defined, nothing relevant or practical was put forward apart from the insipid Monterrey commitments in the field of financial resources, either in terms of public development aid or of debt cancellation."
"We are aware that a decision was taken to create a solidarity fund designed to eradicate poverty."
"We also know, however, that this fund has a purely voluntary basis which is not, therefore, binding. We cannot, therefore, expect great results of it."
"At the same time, this fund demonstrates the clear failure by the developed countries to provide the public aid to which they committed themselves some decades ago."
"In other words, given the lack of adequate resources, we might once again be in the field of good intentions, such as many of those declared in Rio and which experience has shown have gone no further."
"Fundamentally, however, the Johannesburg Summit produced no clear and objective definition of the direction to be taken in order to achieve the realisation of the central objective of the summit, and which it took, incidentally, as its motto: sustainable development."
"We would really like to see, in this field, a level of commitment, a degree of responsibility and a clarity with regard to targets similar to those that have been adopted at the trade summits."
"It is clear, however, that neither the will nor the political priorities are the same, especially on the part of those that determine the outcome of these events."
"And, with regard to this, it is worth pointing out that Secretary of State Colin Powell set the tone by making the very limiting statement that trade is the driving force of development and that Johannesburg is an important step on the path that lies between Doha and the future."
"Much of what happened in Johannesburg can be understood in the light of these two statements placing the entire emphasis on trade."
"Mr President, the lack of success of Johannesburg was due to the change in the political climate."
"This change in the political climate is taking place not only in the US, but also in the EU because we have a much more trade-dominated political agenda than we did in 1992."
"The Verts/ALE Group today considers that we will no longer be credible in the eyes of the G77 countries if we do not change this and add four cornerstones to our international policy."
"Firstly, monitoring is not sufficient."
"We need a binding agreement in the EU on 0.7% of ODA."
"Secondly, we must stop export subsidies on agriculture."
"Thirdly, we must progress in Europe in the area of production and consumption patterns."
"Fourthly, we must stop trade dominance and restore a better balance between multilateral environmental agreements and trade, and also introduce binding agreements for big business with regard to their corporate and social responsibility."
"If we look at the way the negotiations were handled in Johannesburg - and this is another reason for its lack of success - in the first week we had a Commissioner who was primarily interested in trade issues."
"There may have been very good reasons why the Commissioner for the Environment was only able to attend for some 48 hours, but on top of this we had a Commissioner who had determined a substantial part of the negotiations, without any democratic scrutiny, in secret negotiations months ahead of the whole summit."
"Finally, we were less well prepared with regard to the energy partnership than we were on the water partnership."
"That was another reason why we were not able to move ahead quickly on this and you, Commissioners, signed a letter in which you tried to readdress the question of the role of nuclear energy in this partnership."
"Can you give us a clear message that we in Parliament will be much more involved in the future of this partnership, as we requested in our report?"
"Mr President, what we are left with after Johannesburg is little concrete progress and a muddy outlook for future global work on sustainable development."
"What should have been the climax of the Johannesburg summit - the political declaration - ended up being a weak mish-mash of the special interests of various countries which does not dare mention human rights directly, which leaves it up to the corporations themselves to check whether they are meeting their responsibilities and which erased all mention of the promises made at Rio not having been met."
"A declaration that never managed to grasp the nettle and change the circumstances that could really make a difference to the poor people of the world."
"Neither the EU nor the USA had the will to make concessions to the developing countries in the area of aid and trade."
"Both Mr Lange and Mr Turmes have mentioned the EU's agricultural subsidies, which are quite fundamental."
"Consequently it was also difficult to achieve improvements in the areas of the environment and human rights."
"So that was the outcome of hours of negotiations behind closed doors - in sharp contrast to several sections of the declaration, which talk about the broad involvement of partners."
"The Johannesburg Summit provided confirmation of ten years' experience of the USA as a player in global environmental and development policy."
"First they water down the agreements, then they still do not sign up to them anyway."
"Unfortunately, the EU does not have much to boast about either."
"'Let us enter into an agreement capable of replacing darkness and despair with light and hope for hundreds of millions of people,' said Mr Rasmussen in his speech at the summit."
"Sadly, I find it difficult to see where these fine words are reflected in the final outcome."
"Water and sanitation - yes, those are positive things, but if we look at the promises made at Cairo, for example, and at how few of them have been met, I would like to see things implemented before I dare to trust in these promises."
"Do global summits still have a role?"
"Yes and no."
"As long as the rich leaders of the world have no real intention of bringing about improvements for the poor people of the world, the money can be spent on better things than expensive conferences and summits."
"It will take more than pipe dreams to feed the poor properly."
"Mr President, the world at large is slowly getting tired of hearing reports on environmental summits with feeble outcomes."
"Rio still managed to be the bearer of great hopes, at least as regards theoretical approaches and fine words."
"The deeds that ensued were so disappointing that the environmental movement around the world has been virtually struck dumb."
"Kyoto was at least able to formulate an objective."
"The length of the periods of time leading up to implementation is such as to induce paralysis."
"Johannesburg was another disappointment in terms of what had been expected of it."
"Every failed summit does more harm than good, as it brings on a mood of resignation."
"Despite all this, I would like to mention the positive things about Johannesburg."
"For the first time, the European Union set out a practicable way ahead and a definite strategy in the form of the development of renewable energy sources."
"It is of course a matter for regret that the global one per cent increase was not adopted, but the EU now has the chance to live out and demonstrate, within its own borders, the way in which conversion to renewable energy sources makes everyone a winner, in that, by doing so, we will not only be mitigating climatic disaster, but will also be creating five times as many jobs as we would with traditional use of energy, preserving resources around the world, using renewable energy sources to develop technologies that we can export."
"Let us bear in mind that two billion people in the world have no electricity."
"It is now for us to work hard at demonstrating by our actions that we are actually achieving the objectives set by the White Paper for renewable energy sources."
"I would like to point out that we are rather behind in our aim to double their use by 2010."
"I wish to inform you of the progress of our work."
"We should have finished this part at 10 a.m., which would have given us 45 minutes of free debate between the Members present in the Chamber."
"I regret to say that hardly anybody respected the speaking time, with the - greatly appreciated - exception of the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Now, before we start this part of the debate, the two Commissioners have asked to speak - in response to Mrs Hulthén's speech, I imagine - and they will speak later on as well."
"I invite the two Commissioners to be brief in their mid-debate contributions."
"On a point of order, Mr President."
"I think we should ask the Commissioners to reiterate their positions at the end of the debate rather than while it is in progress."
"Now it is the turn of the MEPs!"
"Mr Liese, the two Commissioners are already scheduled to speak at the end of the debate."
"I am quite aware of that."
"However, they have explicitly requested the floor now and I cannot refuse."
"Mr President, we are totally in your hands."
"We can do this in whatever way you want."
"I would like to thank the two Commissioners for their amenability."
"In actual fact, I too found the idea that they should make three contributions to the debate a little odd."
"The two Commissioners will, therefore, respond at the end, after the free debate which is about to take place and the second speeches of the speakers from the political groups."
"Mr President, I am speaking on the Hulthén Report in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group, but I cannot be anything other than astonished at Commissioner Nielson's behaviour in particular."
"What has been reported by the Members of this House who were in Johannesburg, and also his conduct here today, make me wonder whether it makes any sense to let a Parliamentary delegation take part in such summits in this way."
"Let me turn now, though, to Mrs Hulthén's report on climate change, which is excellent and for which I thank her."
"One might say that this topic has been whirled back to the surface by the floods in Germany and in neighbouring countries."
"Although we cannot say that this actual flood was a product of climate change, we are all aware that such events will occur more frequently if we do not take prompt action now."
"This makes the European Climate Change Programme important, but the actual measures so far proposed by the Commission are insufficiently ambitious."
"Emissions trading is a highly controversial topic in this House, and the Commissioner knows that Mr Moreira da Silva has my firm support in his efforts at improving the Commission proposal and preventing it from being watered down."
"The Commission proposal on emissions trading is, however, only a part of a comprehensive strategy."
"Too little has been done to date in the areas of transport and the Budget, and, if we are not careful, this can even result in grave distortions, for example, to the detriment of railways and to the benefit of HGV transport."
"We are still waiting for the proposal on the energy efficiency of machinery."
"If we are to have a comprehensive strategy on this as well, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi should waste no time in submitting a very ambitious proposal."
"I would like to draw Members' particular attention to item 16 in the Hulthén Report, which has to do with the abolition of subsidies that harm the environment and the climate - a difficult topic, but we are sticking with it, dealing as it does with the introduction of a revenue-neutral pollution-related levy for all areas to which emissions trading does not apply."
"This means that industry, if it wants to campaign against emissions trading, has to ask itself whether it would, in its stead, prefer this pollution-related levy, and I do believe that we will then have a hard-headed discussion on this issue."
"Mr President, I welcome the part of the proposed resolution relating to health and meeting health targets."
"Firstly, the reduction of the prevalence of HIV-AIDS - a disease that has reduced life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa from 62 to 47 years - is an absolutely essential target."
"There are reliable estimates to say that if the present state of the disease continues, every other 15-year-old girl in South Africa will die of HIV-AIDS."
"One way to combat this is through further development of microbicides."
"This particular form of preventive treatment can be singled out because, unlike conventional methods of protection, it allows women to take responsibility for its use."
"The problem is that investment in their development is not sufficient and such treatments are still several years away."
"There is a real problem in obtaining money for clinical trials."
"The second point is to draw the attention of colleagues to Parliament's own work on the Sixth Framework Programme."
"Through this programme the European Union has given high priority to combating poverty-linked infectious diseases, such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"Finally, I should like to mention access to medicines."
"I hope the present contretemps about TRIPs and possible barriers to the most modern medicines will be overcome very shortly."
"There is also a shortage of generic medicines, the cheaper medicines and other forms of treatment, which are just as important in countries where poverty is so rife and where water standards are so poor."
"It is a priority and the European Union must do all it can to stave off one of the biggest threats to the global population - disease."
"Mr President, I listened carefully to the two Commissioners emphasise the positive role played by the European Union during the negotiations at the Johannesburg Summit."
"I think that it is true that the European Union played a positive role."
"I would like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that if we really want to make progress at this type of summit, we must be credible to the partners who take part in negotiations and discussions."
"In this case, however, our credibility is marred by the fact that the European Union, in a whole string of policies, is doing the opposite of what it claims to want to do."
"If we take the case of the common agricultural policy, the current debate on Mr Fischler's proposals shows that the majority of the Member States are reluctant to change, are reluctant to abandon the privileges that we acquired in the area of export subsidies."
"We absolutely must make an effort in this area to withdraw export subsidies and to gain this credibility in countries which are affected by these subsidies."
"If we do not do this, how can we ensure that, at summits of this type, these people listen to us slightly more earnestly than they do at the moment?"
"They are not listening to us, because we are not credible."
"I am thinking of the agricultural policy, of the fisheries policy, which we are proposing to reform as well."
"The future will tell us that if we are not capable of revising these policies, in the appropriate fashion, we will not succeed in gaining more influence at forthcoming summits, because the Johannesburg Summit is not the only one, there will be many others."
"It is absolutely essential that we put our own house in order before we tell others what to do."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the wording of items 6 and 7 on the CAP and the agricultural subsidies demonstrates three major political mistakes."
"The first is a total ignorance of the declaration signed in Doha, where the European Union agreed to reduce its export subsidies, but managed to insist that all other types of subsidies, specifically the credits handed out by the United States of America and the state undertakings of other countries, should also be reduced."
"And this is a major victory for the European Union to have achieved."
"The second reason is that this wording reveals a completely ingenuous analysis, which states that a unilateral reduction of subsidies by the European Union could solve the problems."
"Especially at a time when the United States has just approved an agricultural policy in which they increase their subsidies and especially when it is widely known that this new American policy is heightening the depression in world prices."
"This way of thinking is all the more ingenuous because the USA is the largest exporter of agricultural products to the Developing World, and not only to the European Union."
"The third reason is this declaration's incomprehensible silence on the European Union initiative known as 'everything but arms', which is to date the largest, most relevant and generous offer made by the developed countries to the world's poorest countries."
"And the fact that this has been ignored and not mentioned is incomprehensible."
"In other words, we are not valuing our own efforts."
"All these reasons, therefore, explain why the wording of items 6 and 7 in this declaration on agriculture is known in politics as 'shooting oneself in the foot': this weakens the European Union, this European Union that has until now been the most powerful force promoting the interests of the poorest countries."
"This is why it is crucial, in tomorrow's voting time, to remedy these aspects."
"Mr President, politics works in such a way that, after each international meeting, we spend more time talking about the results that are, apparently, still unsatisfactory than about the actual progress that was made."
"This is what happened after Rio, this is what happened after Kyoto, even though, in the meantime, Rio and Kyoto became undeniable milestones in the area of sustainable development."
"The concept of sustainable development has become a chant, a sort of enchanted prayer that is uttered indiscriminately."
"In my view, it is obvious that there can be no sustainable development without economic and social development - it is as simple as that."
"Poverty is the major enemy to managing natural resources and protecting the environment in a responsible manner."
"Responsible globalisation must become the process of a global economic development that makes genuine global solidarity possible."
"State development aid is not sufficient, even if we manage to double or triple it."
"USD 50 billion of state aid is not much."
"Americans spend the same amount of money on the upkeep of their lawns!"
"In 2001, a year that did not bode well for international investment, private investment flows towards developing countries amounted to over USD 200 billion, in other words already four times more than the total state aid."
"For private investment to reach all countries, we must, as a necessity, negotiate a multilateral agreement on investment protection, which involves creating international arbitration bodies responsible for resolving disputes."
"No private investor - no ethical investment fund, even - will invest any money without guarantees and without the prospect of a return."
"In the absence of any multilateral rules, there will be an avalanche of bilateral agreements."
"There are already more than 1 200!"
"Yet, in all bilateral agreements, it is not the poorest partner who dictates the conditions."
"Sustainable development needs global standards, and these standards are also needed for investments and for their protection."
"Mr President, I shall focus on the European programme on climate change."
"I fully and wholeheartedly agree with everything Mrs Anneli Hulthén has to say on this matter, but I do miss one aspect, namely communication with the citizen."
"Since the recent floods, the seriousness of any potential climate change is starting to strike home, but few are aware, let alone convinced, of the need for action."
"I would suggest three points that could facilitate communication with the citizen."
"First of all, I believe that the citizen must be given clear choices."
"Although Member States play an important role in this, the Commission can do a great deal to clarify the options."
"What is the implication, for example, of reducing the maximum speed on motorways to 100 km/hour?"
"How much do we stand to gain?"
"What does it mean if each house were to be fitted with a solar panel or use low-energy light bulbs?"
"Are these merely drops in the ocean or do they make a substantial contribution?"
"If the choices were clear, then citizens could become involved in the subject of climate."
"Policy on climate could then also become integrated in a climate strategy."
"Secondly, policy on climate should be placed much more in the context of development."
"Investing in sustainable energy is costly, but rewarding."
"At present, 2 billion people have no access to electricity."
"Sustainable energy is local and can give an enormous boost to development."
"We should not only send out this message in Johannesburg, but also in Brussels and Strasbourg, and preferably every day."
"Thirdly, a flagship is what is needed."
"Member States must invest jointly in the development of sustainable energy and energy efficiency."
"Something along the lines of the Airbus project."
"The Sixth Framework Programme for research and Article 169 offer good opportunities in this area."
"A flagship project is visible to the citizens and can play a key role in public awareness."
"Commissioner, in my view, there could be a little more enthusiasm for policy on climate."
"To date, we have mainly sent out a negative signal and a sombre message."
"More attention to communication and the political aspects could contribute to public involvement."
"Mr President, I have just had this confirmed to me by various Fisheries Ministers meeting at Reykjavik in Iceland."
"These Fisheries Ministers came from the USA, Chile, Sri Lanka, Tunisia, the Faeroes, Norway, and so on. They say unanimously that Johannesburg is on the right track with this decision."
"Rarely enough are there real political decisions."
"Everyone prefers to rush to coat their personal or national egoisms with a veneer of sanctity, particularly when the eyes of world public opinion are upon them."
"This time, though, there was a real decision on sustainability and on the fisheries sector, which has undergone such a severe battering."
"This agreement on a point of principle was achieved very quickly."
"It sends the message that there is nothing more to be discussed, and that now is the time to act."
"That is Johannesburg's appeal to the world."
"It is also addressed to us who have Europe for our home and sit in this Parliament."
"The reform of European fisheries policy simply will not wait."
"It is of great intrinsic value and must not be used to gain advantages in other policy fields by being a pawn in negotiating tactics and games that it is all too easy to see through."
"That is what is also called meeting each other halfway at the expense of fisheries."
"Johannesburg was unerring in recognising that."
"Fish stocks are to recover by 2015."
"Now we have to get a move on."
"I hope this will be one of our successes - one of the successes of the European Union within the framework of a reform that is imminent and can be delayed no longer."
"Mr President, Commissioners you will be beginning to find our speeches repetitive."
"Great: in a multi-national and cross-party body, that means our message will get through."
"We all agree, for example, that energy is the largest contributor by far to the emission of greenhouse gases. Some of us think that nuclear energy is expensive, outdated, potentially dangerous and no solution at all to energy problems."
"But we all agree that transport is the key energy problem: fossil fuels must be replaced by alternatives, and very soon."
"How?"
"We agree that renewable energy and energy efficiency are key solutions."
"This was recognised in Johannesburg, but unfortunately, only to a limited extent."
"However, we should act quickly on this through the EU."
"Remember that the key role of energy in poverty alleviation was recognised at Johannesburg, and that the new EU programme, COOPENER, on renewable energy and energy efficiency in the developing world, will help to access some of the funding which will be available, this programme is important."
"There is, incidentally, a very strong gender implication to the provision of energy, because of the tasks of women throughout the developing world."
"The failure to achieve targets for renewable energy - a failure for which the United States, to their shame, are largely responsible - can be overcome with goodwill and effort from the European Union."
"On the matter of implementation: Carrying suitcases from summit to summit does nothing."
"It is what happens in between the summits that matters, and I urge you, Commissioners, to use your legislative powers and your monitoring ability to ensure that what was said at Johannesburg, even if it is not enough, is carried through."
"Mr President, I was one of the Members who attended the summit in Johannesburg and was fortunate enough to meet some of the thousands who went there from all over the world to focus attention on the need for people-centred policies."
"We heard over and over again that the summit had to change the lives of the poorest people in the world if it was to be a success."
"We did not expect dramatic changes and we did not get them, but there was some modest progress."
"For example we saw a move towards achieving better governance."
"I hope that this Parliament will actively support universal membership of the UNEP for environment ministers."
"This could be the starting point for a world environment organisation."
"This brings us to the central question of enforcement and monitoring."
"We know from experience since Rio that it is one thing to make agreements but another to ensure they are implemented."
"We welcome the possibility at last of bringing the Kyoto Protocol into force, but it has been a long and difficult process."
"How will progress from Johannesburg onwards be achieved?"
"It is not clear."
"Although the Johannesburg Declaration includes a commitment to an inclusive process, which means involving the kinds of groups that met around the summit, how is this going to be done?"
"Similarly the regional and local level are important."
"We know how the private sector is going to be involved, but how will different levels of government be involved?"
"Finally, I welcome the fact that the efforts to include biotechnology as an intrinsic part of sustainability were resisted in Johannesburg, despite the efforts of the United States."
"At the very time when the summit was going on to use a human crisis to try and force GM food aid on some of the world's poorest countries."
"This takes away freedom of choice, undermines human dignity and works against sustainability."
"We must continue to resist it."
"Mr President, Commissioners, I am reminded of the optimism caricatured by the French philosopher Voltaire in the person of Pangloss, which, in fact, derives from the philosophy of the German philosopher Leibniz, according to which 'everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds'."
"If Voltaire were to return here, however, he would also draw a caricature, certainly a very impressive one, of those that today think that everything is for the worst in the worst of all possible worlds."
"This almost phantasmagoric pessimism that affects many commentators, many politicians and many Members of this House is unjustified."
"It is unjustified because at the Johannesburg Summit, as I see it, indication was given of the right way forwards, the correct diagnosis was made, and the European Union acted correctly at the summit, and we should be congratulating it on this instead of being constantly critical."
"The summit pointed in the right direction but we must also take account of the fact that the rich countries are going to have to pay for the policies that were outlined in Johannesburg and that control mechanisms must be established to ensure, as has already been said, that words are translated into action."
"I would also say that the Johannesburg Summit served to reveal some of our fears and weaknesses in analysing the world's problems."
"I wish to highlight only one of these, if I may, which is the issue of birth control and the world's population."
"It makes no sense that this problem should not be addressed because we fear religious dogma, the type of dogma that Voltaire condemned, or because we fear being considered Malthusian."
"We all know that it is precisely where the population grows at a faster pace that we see more poverty and more degradation of nature."
"And, therefore, this issue of birth control, of the global regulation of the world's population cannot be ignored in any discussion about the survival of the earth and about a more humane life for human beings."
"We now come to the speakers from the political groups."
"The good news is that I can be flexible in terms of timings: speaking time can be extended if the speakers so wish."
"Mr President, the previous speaker referred to Voltaire."
"Let me refer to a Danish author, Hans Christian Andersen, who wrote a story that many of us have read, The Emperor's New Clothes."
"Sometimes I feel that the debate we are holding is a little reminiscent of this very story."
"Everyone can see that the emperor is naked, but we will not, dare not, actually say so."
"I am therefore one of those who cannot in any way see the Johannesburg Summit as a success."
"I think that it was good that the meeting was held, that a large number of contacts were made and that a number of good decisions were taken."
"Given the problems we face on this small planet; poverty which continues to spread rapidly, the spread of infectious diseases, the many environmental problems and, especially, the tremendously rapid development in technology in many areas, some form of regulatory framework is required if it is to work well."
"What we arrived at in Johannesburg is not sufficient."
"Unfortunately, I am afraid that we will meet here again in five or ten years and that we will then see that a great many of the problems that have quite rightly been identified in connection with Johannesburg will have become worse."
"Let me raise an issue where I think that the final result from Johannesburg leaves a great deal to be desired."
"As early as 1992 in Rio de Janeiro it was seen that current patterns of production and consumption are not working in a world with seven to eight billion people."
"At the same time, everyone wants the poor countries to develop."
"It is therefore obvious that production and consumption must change."
"What I had hoped for from Johannesburg was a real commitment from the rich countries to assist with the modernisation of patterns of production and consumption in the poor countries."
"This applies to energy production, which is now expanding very rapidly, this applies to transport, it applies to chemicals, waste handling, agriculture and water."
"Every year, countries like China, India, Mexico, Indonesia and Brazil invest hundreds of billons of US dollars or more in new energy production."
"Most of this is carbon technology."
"We have a self-interest in helping out with favourable loans, with subsidies and with technical cooperation in order to actually ensure that the required energy development also occurs in an environmentally friendly and efficient manner."
"Unfortunately we do not have the instruments."
"I welcome the initiatives that the Commission took on Sustainable Energy."
"I think that this was very good, especially in the light of the Commission's previous doubts about making vigorous efforts in this area."
"I will gladly contribute towards working out the details, but this is a very limited measure compared with the great needs that exist."
"I consider that we need efforts of a completely different magnitude."
"It seems as if we have realised this too late."
"In a few years, we will undoubtedly increase resources in this context, but they are required now."
"Let me conclude by stating that perhaps we simply have too great a level of expectation from this type of international cooperation."
"I think that Commissioner Wallström made a very true remark in the days after the Johannesburg Summit."
"She said 'that it is possible that we must find other ways, that we must identify countries that want to go further, including hopefully the European Union'."
"We should perhaps create partnerships with companies that want to progress further and faster, with popular movements, with researchers and so on, so that we can achieve greater speed in some of the areas where the situation is particularly critical."
"We simply do not have any political system at the international level that is a match for the development that is now occurring, where so many problems of different types require common rules."
"I look forward to initiatives from the Commission in these areas."
"I would ask the Commission in each individual case to involve Parliament at an earlier stage."
"As regards the initiatives that the Commission took in the areas of water and energy, we have never had an opportunity to present any opinions, something which is somewhat frustrating considering that there is indisputable commitment and interest in these areas."
"Mr President, I would like right away to enlarge on Mr Wijkman's analogy with Hans Christian Andersen's story of the king's new clothes."
"I do think that there are enough Members of this House, who, on finding the king totally naked, would say so out loud in the plenary."
"I believe it is very difficult to assess either the role of the European Union or the results of the Johannesburg Summit."
"None of us is satisfied with the results."
"We would, in various areas, have preferred results that went further."
"I would, though, like to say that I see the European Union's - Europe's - role as having been a good one and one that was also well coordinated."
"It should also be said at this juncture that, on the most important demands, coordination between the European Union and the candidate countries worked."
"I am of course not satisfied with the Commission's attitude towards us, or with the information policy."
"I want to address Commissioner Nielson directly in saying that we did not expect all our demands to be met, but it is sometimes the case that the tone is what matters in music, and at times our side was dissatisfied with the way the parliamentarians were negotiated with or spoken to."
"I took part in this delegation as a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and one of the major topics in Johannesburg was of course the way in which development is financed."
"It was also clear that we will not go back to the way things were before Monterrey."
"One generally wonders whether it makes sense to stage UN summits of this sort at short intervals and then end up with little substance to the agenda at a summit on sustainability."
"That, though, is the responsibility not of the Commission, or of Parliament, but of the United Nations."
"The question I want to put to the Commission is a very straightforward one: how will we monitor the Monterrey undertaking to allocate an average of 0.39% of gross domestic product to development cooperation with effect from 2006?"
"Will Parliament receive reports on development?"
"I am from Austria, and on this point I am less than proud of my own country, which is among those at the bottom of the league as regards support for development cooperation."
"Now for the actual question."
"I know that you cannot draw up the national budgets, but what form will follow-up take, including as regards Parliament?"
"Something I found quite absent from Johannesburg was the issue of population growth and that of reproductive health."
"I found the formulations in the final text to be woolly, to say the least."
"There is reference in them to health and to mothers, but not to reproductive health, which, along with family planning, I believe to be essential issues in sustainable development."
"I would, however, like to express my gratitude for the clear position that the European Union has taken up on these issues."
"We know that America, with the fundamentalist states, has stood in the way of progress of every kind and that the requirements of the Cairo Action Programme on reproductive health are far from being complied with."
"Mr President, Parliament's task is, in the first place, to monitor the Commission and, in general, the Council's and Commission's achievements in Johannesburg."
"I think that this debate demonstrates that we can be rather positive about the role Europe played."
"In my view, Commissioner Wallström was right in saying that the European Union was the driving force behind the Johannesburg Summit."
"As far as I can see, though, the results of Johannesburg are too insubstantial, but this is actually more despite rather than thanks to the EU's efforts."
"I believe we can be pleased about the role we ourselves played on that forum."
"Nevertheless, the outcome of Johannesburg is, broadly speaking, too insubstantial."
"In not one single area have verifiable and firm goals been established, and sanctions pertaining to the infringement of the already weak goals are completely lacking."
"I believe that this is because these goals were too abstract."
"Everyone is in favour of cleaner water, less poverty and more education, but in my view, the Heads of State or Government should have directed their energy more towards achievable and concrete projects."
"The Rio Summit had already taught us that concluding agreements that cannot be enforced is an empty exercise."
"Despite this, some positive results have been achieved which have been mentioned in this debate."
"I should particularly like to single out progress in the field of cleaner water, hygiene and the prevention of diseases."
"These elements are, of course, of crucial importance, particularly for the poorer sections of the world's population."
"Another positive development is what has finally been said in the documents on fisheries and on energy, although concerning the latter, these documents could have easily been a bit more constructive in the chapters on wind and solar energy and hydropower."
"Anyway, this too is something which causes no problems in the EU but has run into major problems elsewhere."
"These texts are upbeat, even the introduction in the text on agriculture and relevant subsidies is upbeat, in my view."
"It is not, however, the EU that we have to thank for this, of course."
"Quite the reverse, in fact; the EU could have been a little more accommodating on this front."
"Anyway, we are all familiar with the internal situation."
"It is a matter on which we need to reach a better position internally the sooner the better."
"Agriculture still remains a weak point for all of us in those international negotiations, and this is something we only have ourselves to thank for and which requires our involvement."
"It is also related to the issue of environmentally harmful subsidies, something that we know Commissioner Wallström wishes to address in the EU."
"It is a matter related to agriculture, but also to all kinds of other subsidies that we provide in the EU, as this is also done worldwide."
"The fact that we made little progress in this area in Johannesburg should serve as an incentive to address it within the EU and outside it as a matter of priority."
"I should like to finish off with a comment on the role of Parliament's delegation."
"I did not intend to mention this at first, but since the matter has now been brought into the open in such a manifest way, I should like to say a few words."
"This delegation was, incidentally, excellently led by our fellow MEP Mr Moreira da Silva."
"I should like to express gratitude on behalf of our group for the way in which he acquitted himself of this task."
"I should also like to thank the Danish Presidency."
"We - at any rate those of my group who attended the Johannesburg Summit - were delighted with the communication at the summit."
"I am, however, somewhat surprised about the comments by Commissioner Nielson on this score."
"I can understand that it is disagreeable to be monitored by troublesome MEPs, but it is still necessary for us to join forces more effectively at times like these."
"We must create a wider support."
"I think that the MEPs who attended the summit had a positive attitude and that better cooperation and communication benefits us all."
"The Commissioner struck me as somewhat acidic in his comments, and the environment is acidic enough as it is without the need for an acidic Commissioner."
"I therefore hope that in future, at other conferences too - for this was not a one-off problem, but one that also plays a part elsewhere - better cooperation will be established between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Cooperation is fluid and requires a positive attitude, not only from Parliament, but also from the other institutions, and this will eventually benefit us all."
"Mr President, with all due respect to the Commission and the Council, the judgments we are making here in the European Parliament are being made on the basis of resolutions which we passed before Johannesburg."
"We passed our resolutions and we held our debate and, that being so, I have no desire to challenge all the positive points we have managed to find in Johannesburg or what Mrs Wallström has said or what the honourable Members who were in Johannesburg have said."
"I shall not reiterate them, just as I shall refrain from reiterating the negative points, the specifics, aid, renewable sources of energy etc., issues which my honourable friends have already raised."
"I should like, if I may, to comment on two or three other points which perhaps received too little attention."
"We said before Johannesburg that we need to strike a balance between development and trade on the one hand and environmental protection on the other."
"This balance was not struck."
"The Johannesburg text is full of references, reservations and provisos, just to make sure we keep our hands off trade."
"It is written with one eye on the World Trade Organisation and there is no institution with the same standing and influence as the World Trade Organisation to oppose it."
"That is a fact."
"It is not good, I am not saying it is fatal, but it is a fact nonetheless."
"A second point we made was that we needed to incorporate the cost of environmental protection into our production and our consumption in the most practical way possible."
"Instead of this, which implies certain things, it implies taxes, it implies bans, political arrangements, a whole series of topics under discussion, we have a statement to the effect that we need to change production methods and consumption patterns."
"And why not?"
"All very ambitious and even rather literary, I think, but it does not say to what."
"To me, it is totally incomprehensible, as it is to my first year economics students."
"A third point we made was that we would at least try to keep to and, of course, build on and implement what was said in Rio."
"For example, what has become of the principle of prevention?"
"Why was there a preventive approach?"
"What does this bode for the future?"
"For the policy which we, the United States and others will apply?"
"Why were the United States so insistent?"
"A fourth point we highlighted was the policy and international dimension of environmental protection and sustainable development."
"Instead, nothing was done."
"And with all due respect, not only was no world environment organisation set up; it was buried post haste before Johannesburg had barely started and all discussion of greater political coordination between old and new bodies, between Bretton Woods and the World Trade Organisation, for instance, with the political objective of sustainable development, was sidelined."
"Why?"
"How are we supposed to pursue a line of thinking that says we set targets, we introduce measures, we monitor and control and we impose sanctions?"
"Which is the very essence of governance."
"Governance means no more and no less."
"Because if all it means is moralising to Developing World countries, however useful that may be, it is too little and it is highly hypocritical on our part."
"I think that pretty speeches were made, with no targets, means or timetables and we need to keep an eye on that."
"I suggest and request that we think hard."
"Surely somehow - I think under the Rules of Procedure - the European Parliament should be able to set up an ad hoc committee to permanently monitor the application of all these pretty speeches along general lines to have come out of Johannesburg, so that we can also look at what the Commission and the spring Council bring and what is happening internationally, so that we do not just simply end up like Epimetheus, saying what we like or dislike after the event and with no monitoring on our part."
"Mr President, let us not mince our words."
"Johannesburg was not a success."
"The results were disappointing, but I am pleased that the Commission is now giving a balanced judgment rather than the overoptimistic views it expressed immediately at the end of the summit."
"In our view, if the summit were to be rated according to the Dutch rating system, it would be given a four out of ten, a fail in other words."
"I am bound to correct the Commission on one point, namely biodiversity."
"It has not been agreed worldwide that we will put an end to the loss of biodiversity by 2010."
"The only thing that has been decided is to significantly reduce the extinction of species, while only this spring, 100 ministers in The Hague called for an end to the loss of biodiversity by no later than 2010, as we have also stated at European level."
"The question is, of course, why Europe has achieved so little."
"Of course, it is true that the United States wanted hardly anything, but many G77 countries are also tired of unfulfilled promises."
"They were promised more development aid while they are, in fact, receiving less."
"This is why it is logical that these G77 countries have focused on the traditional fight against poverty and for clean drinking water, sanitary facilities and energy for the poor."
"This is what they got, which is a positive thing."
"We must, however, search our own conscience."
"Too many key players in Europe, particularly Commissioners Lamy and Nielson, saw Johannesburg only as an intermediary step between Doha and Cancùn."
"That is why Europe had hardly anything to offer to the G77 countries."
"This is not helped by the fact that we still have not reformed our own agricultural policy and that we consider our own trade interests to be more important than sustainable development."
"We have not got our own house in order in terms of agriculture, fisheries, traffic, energy and the use of materials."
"I do not think that mega-summits of this kind will work any more in future."
"We should move towards UN summits that address specific goals, the prime example being Kyoto."
"If it is impossible to conclude a treaty at world level, Europe should at least act consistently on its own patch."
"What we need, for example, is a UN treaty in which multinational businesses are required to issue a social and environmental report that is inspected by independent accountants."
"We can start with this in Europe."
"It is also necessary for large businesses, maybe over a 5- or 10-year period, to commit to using the same environmental standards outside Europe as they do inside."
"Volkswagen is already doing this."
"After all, South Africa and Namibia do not have environmental legislation, let alone any system of enforcement."
"We cannot wait for a worldwide regulation in the environmental field."
"Another example is deforestation."
"Rio failed to produce a treaty, and so did Johannesburg, but there is something we can do in Europe."
"Why does the European Commission not suggest that a clear label be introduced for timber and timber products?"
"A green label for sustainable timber and a red label for incorrectly produced timber."
"My group would like to see us adopt an even-handed approach in trade policy."
"I hope that Mrs Wallström will join in the preparatory meetings of Cancùn and that she will be representing Europe at that summit in Cancùn in a year's time, for this is the only way we can prove that we take sustainable development seriously."
"Mr President, I consider sustainable development to be an expression of the task given by God to mankind to cultivate and preserve the earth."
"It is essential for a balance to be struck between social, economic and environmental components."
"Moreover, we should try to achieve this balance in the developed and the developing countries alike."
"The Johannesburg Summit has culminated in a plan of action which mainly focuses on the economic goals and not so much on the environmental goals."
"This is hardly a balance, therefore."
"Ten years ago, a legal framework for climate and biodiversity was established in Rio."
"The Kyoto Protocol has been drafted for climate, but ratification and implementation are still a major point of concern."
"As far as biodiversity is concerned, we opted for the status quo ten years ago."
"As Mr Alexander de Roo mentioned earlier, this goal has now been watered down in Johannesburg to a decelerated decline in biodiversity."
"In addition, the summit did not manage to reach definite agreement on sustainable energy."
"Despite great European ambitions, and it is certainly no criticism of the Commissioners, worldwide sustainable development has not been given any extra impetus."
"Fortunately, there are also a number of positive elements to report, including target goals for drinking water and sanitary facilities, chemicals, fish stocks, the fight against poverty, hunger and child mortality."
"As regards development aid, however, the rich nations have for the past ten years been promising that they intend to spend 0.7% of their GNP on it."
"When will this happen?"
"I would have liked to have seen a deadline set for this."
"The fight against poverty can create scope for environmental protection, for it is true that if people have no food, no housing and no clean drinking water, environmental protection is often a concern for later."
"In other words, we must create a support structure for environmental protection and this is why it is our primary task to do something about the fight against poverty."
"If the agreement, taken from the Johannesburg plan of action, that trade policy should not affect the development of poor countries and is taken seriously in the area of the environment, this will have far-reaching consequences for European agricultural and trade policy."
"I should like to hear from both Commissioners what their views are on this."
"Many people seem happy with the outcome of the UN Conference in Johannesburg on sustainable development."
"Whether my grandchildren will see things in the same light 20 years from now remains to be seen."
"This is a requirement, however, if we consider Mrs Brundtland's commitment to achieve a good definition of sustainable development."
"The implementation of the goals will certainly need to make a contribution to this."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I believe that we are all staunch advocates of the need to improve the quality of the environment."
"I am, however, convinced that we must take as a starting point the consideration that the quality of life and, in many respects, the quality of the environment in the world too are not declining, as some people would have us believe, and that we must therefore avoid any form of disaster-mongering, and I am thinking here of the - subsequently disregarded - predictions of disasters which characterised the environmentalism of the 1970s, from Stockholm to the Rome Club."
"This does not, however, mean reducing our efforts to address environmental issues, which are, moreover, the items on the Johannesburg agenda."
"I have two points to make in this regard."
"Firstly, as, moreover, has been pointed out repeatedly by Members too, I am convinced that one of the decisive factors in improving the quality of life of many peoples and, therefore, of the environment, is the need to open up markets to international trade."
"I believe that the United States, the subject of much criticism in this House, is right on this point, and I feel that Europe must do more in the area of agricultural policy, agricultural protectionism and other forms of trade protectionism."
"We would point out that the Everything but Arms initiative of which the Commission is so proud - and it is right, in part, to be so - provides for the elimination of all agricultural duties and quotas on products such as sugar, rice and bananas imported from the poorest countries."
"This is the commitment we Europeans have to make good."
"Secondly, the countries which do most to protect the environment are democratic countries where human rights are respected, the countries with open economies."
"The increase in development aid has been mentioned: that is all well and good, but I would point out, first and foremost to the European Commissioners and Commissioner Nielson, that much of the aid which Europe appropriates serves to fund dictatorships, non-democratic countries, countries without open economies."
"In those countries, our funding does not lead to improvement of either the quality of the environment or environmental policies."
"May I thank the Commissioners for their cooperation in agreeing to speak at the end, rather than at the beginning of the debate."
"Mr President, I shall start by carrying on exactly where Minister Haarder finished."
"The Commission is looking forward to this."
"As Mrs Hulthén pointed out at the beginning of the debate, we are also looking forward to coming back to Parliament in February to discuss how the follow-up is to be organised."
"All this is quite positive."
"There is one new aspect that is very important: the water and energy initiatives are EU initiatives."
"We are moving into new terrain."
"It is not defined only by what the Commission does."
"This is a 'Monterrey-plus' landscape, because we are about to announce and launch global EU actions, which also makes it quite interesting."
"I turn to the discussion on how we view this matter - whether with complacency, or pessimism, or optimism etc. From a literary point of view it is not totally correct to say that the emperor was naked."
"He was wearing some clothes, but only his night attire."
"So one would be justified in asking whether he was half-naked or half-dressed."
"There is no certain answer to this, just as there is no certain answer to how we should approach this area."
"From the very start - even in Johannesburg when we were trying to respond to questions at press conferences - we tried to avoid using the terms 'success' or 'failure' because it was clear that this would never bring us and the people we talk with through the media close enough to something that was a professional and correct evaluation."
"Again, in the course of the discussion we have tried to address the wilful pumping-up or the toning down of expectations before the meeting, which have been referred to as deliberate working methods."
"This makes a lot of sense, but the truth is that with global UN meetings like this we must calibrate expectations to fit in with reality."
"We are firmly in the realm of intergovernmental work."
"Comparing that with what we in Europe could do if we unite is, unfortunately, not fair."
"Everybody talks about the international society."
"We do not have one, we are trying to create one."
"That is where we are."
"I am pleading for professional realism as to how we evaluate these things."
"On balance, whilst progress was made, we would have preferred to have made much more progress."
"However, to express dissatisfaction as Mr Turmes did when he said that we did not come back with the whole Christmas tree, complete with decorations, is an illustration of the fact that one has not allowed oneself the minimum of realism."
"That is the raw material that creates results."
"I wonder whether a debate like this is taking place in any other political centre in the rich North."
"I doubt that the US Congress would devote a day to discussions, as we are, after Johannesburg."
"It would be nice if this happened, but let me remind you that it would be an error to think that it was only because of US attitudes and resistance to multilateral agreements that these were so difficult."
"It is a dangerous illusion to think that the whole G77 group is very enthusiastic about these different targets, or committing itself to a specific energy mix within a certain timeframe."
"This is not how it is in reality."
"The things we need to change cannot be changed easily."
"Mr Moreira Da Silva said some very important things which characterise indicators of progress."
"They are more specifically action-oriented compared to Rio, but this is exactly what we should be doing with regard to Johannesburg."
"Secondly, Mrs McNally and others pointed out the closer and clearer link between the environment and poverty."
"It is extremely important to move closer to reality."
"The balance between the issues of trade, development and the environment has been taken up by a number of speakers."
"We must remember that the basis on which we were able to work in Johannesburg was very clearly defined by decisions in the Council clarifying our mandate."
"In essence, Europe clearly wanted, and needed, to stick to the Doha formula."
"We could neither add nor subtract anything."
"This was the political basis on which we were able to negotiate in Johannesburg."
"Some may not like it, but it was a diplomatic achievement for Europe that we came back from Johannesburg with a formula that clearly reflected our words and left the Doha track open and clear, as it should be."
"Please bear in mind that the meltdown in Seattle was due to an overload of the international agenda."
"If we had not cleared this up, and done what we did in Doha and Monterrey in order to allow the world to discuss sustainable development in Johannesburg, the whole thing would have been one big mess, damaging our attempts to tackle our problems with liberalising, and reducing subsidies for, agriculture."
"All that is now part of the Doha track."
"This would have been damaged if we had tried to 'redo' Doha in Johannesburg."
"As far as the institutional debate is concerned, some people clearly find it a problem that I described the cold hard reality of institutional agreements."
"I noted Minister Haarder's remarks when he said that he could not promise any changes here today."
"Strangely enough this is exactly what I told Members of Parliament in Johannesburg."
"I could not undertake to depart from the institutional agreement."
"Nor should we regard this debate as simply a discussion between Members of Parliament and a Commissioner."
"Normally one says that it takes two to tango, but the institutional complexity of the European institutions is such that for us it takes three to tango."
"It is therefore a mistake to think that this discussion is just between Parliament and the Commission."
"In fact if people look at what actually took place in Johannesburg, they will see that we did our utmost to try to inform parliamentarians."
"I would certainly have welcomed full participation by parliamentarians until the end of the summit."
"Unfortunately, however, after the weekend, very few stayed in Johannesburg until the end."
"The money spent on travelling there with nine assistants would have been far better spent if Parliament had allowed its representatives to stay throughout the international meetings rather than returning home in the middle."
"That would have strengthened cooperation."
"I would say to Mrs Evans and Mrs McNally that an integrated approach to energy, gender, poverty, health and population - a point which was also very strongly made by Mrs Scheele - corresponds exactly with the kind of approach that is required."
"Mrs Evans stressed the importance of enforcing monitoring."
"The best method is to incorporate this into the country and regional strategies to secure ownership in the South."
"Considering what I said before about the lack of enthusiasm shown by many countries in the South to do these things, it is extremely important that we ensure that this is anchored in their own planning."
"Mrs Scheele also asked how we are monitoring the financial commitments to development assistance levels made by Member States and the Union collectively in Monterrey."
"Fortunately, monitoring is already available via the reports which are made to the Development Assistance Committee in the OECD."
"This means that every donor country is obliged to submit information which the Commission will use to gain feedback."
"Discussions will be held on a regular basis to ensure that this increase is actually happening."
"The discussion on reproductive health and rights dominated the last days of the summit."
"This is another reason why I would have welcomed the presence of Members of Parliament during that time."
"Article 47 of the political declaration was the result of a huge battle that was fought, day and night, before we finally managed, with the support of Canada, to get the established Cairo terms accepted."
"These were reintroduced into the text and we avoided a major defeat at the hands of the dark coalition of you-know-who."
"We ended up with something acceptable."
"This was an unwelcome drama."
"It is very disturbing to have to fight for something like this."
"I have covered some of the aspects."
"Certainly, the enormous follow-up task is going to be a huge challenge."
"The water initiative - trying to organise regional cooperation in all the major African river systems - will be a huge project."
"We hope this will also feed into the general effort of trying to create more stable regional cooperation, which again will be good for democracy, stability and liberalisation of trade."
"So we see the water initiative there not only as an aim in itself but as something which is also very positive with regard to its indirect effects."
"Mr President, we have been here since 9 a.m. to speak about the outcome of the Johannesburg Summit."
"Some Members have taken pleasure in attacking the Commission on the pretext that it has, apparently, failed to communicate sufficient information."
"In my view, the Commission did a good job in Johannesburg."
"It defended European positions, even though it was unable to impose Europe's views on the rest of the world."
"And although the Commission did not have enough time to boost the egos of certain Members who were twiddling their thumbs in their hotel, it is certainly not a tragedy."
"I also think that the same Members who criticised the Commission should have at least stayed in the Chamber to listen to the answers provided by the Commissioners and the Council."
"Mr President, as you know, I led Parliament's delegation in Johannesburg and I should like to explain something, because I think that Commissioner Nielsen has confused matters somewhat."
"Commissioner Nielsen has not understood why we are praising the Council and criticising the Commission for the fact that Parliament was not given the institutional role it should have had."
"I shall try to explain once again: Let us separate the institutional level, the role of Parliament, from political cooperation."
"At the institutional level, we want both the Commission and the Council to support our right to participate in the daily coordination meetings of the European Union."
"This is a matter to be resolved under the forthcoming revision of the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"Cooperation policy is a very diverse thing and we had the feeling that, in the framework of cooperation policy, the Council was acting with transparency and the Commission was guilty of omission."
"And this is what is causing us certain difficulties because we were not used to this sort of behaviour by the Commission; we were used to seeing its commitment, to holding joint Parliament press conferences with the Commission and with the Council, to openness, to a real involvement of Parliament, which this time we only felt was apparent, unfortunately, on the part of the Council."
"Mr President, I too was in Johannesburg and I spent very little time at my hotel, and not because I was doing the rounds of the famous bars of Johannesburg."
"I just wanted to say this: the Commissioner referred to the presence of MEPs in Johannesburg and said, I think somewhat condescendingly, that we left before the work was finished and would have done well to have stayed until the end."
"I assume the Commissioner meant, if we expected to be taken seriously."
"Could you please confirm to us from the chair that our delegation to Johannesburg had orders from the Bureau itself to leave for Europe by Sunday at the latest in order to attend September's part-session."
"The Rules say that Members cannot be on mission during Parliament's plenary session."
"Mr President, I would like to turn to our audience today and welcome them to this debate in the European Parliament."
"We are discussing two different things, although they are interlinked."
"We are discussing a report that has been drawn up by Mrs Hulthén, a Swedish MEP, about how to combat climate change."
"I would first like to comment on that and then make some concluding remarks about our discussion on Johannesburg."
"I will now speak Swedish for a little while."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"I have received a motion for a resolution"
"(FR) Being aware of the lack of conviction at international level in favour of a sustainable development which reduces poverty and preserves the environment, we are nonetheless reassured that the principles agreed at Rio will be honoured."
"Which was not self-evident, so whose fault is it?"
"Community responsibility for this lamentable lack of progress should not be diminished."
"The collective failure amounts to a loss of credibility."
"It is ridiculous to seek majority agreements with the G77 countries, who were allies at Rio and Kyoto, whilst the Union's own plan for a sustainable development within its borders has failed!"
"The examples are as numerous as they are revealing: biodiversity, the subject of a Convention in Rio, continues to decline sharply."
"Species are disappearing and habitats are being lost forever."
"The 'Biodiversity' action plan is honourable, though it is nothing more than a pious hope."
"And it is still an instinctive response for many Member States to overlook the 'Birds' and 'Habitats' Directives."
"It is our essential political and moral responsibility to demand of ourselves what we are demanding of others."
"The Commission must provide an annual presentation of the progress made in integrating the dimension of sustainable development in all Community policies."
"In order to restore Europe's credibility, we must, in conjunction with our international partners, draft a policy to eradicate poverty and industrial processes that are damaging our ecology."
"Mr President, on a point of order, on Monday I raised a point of order about Rule 2 and yesterday had the Minutes corrected to indicate the exact purport of that point."
"In my remarks on Monday I suggested that there was a risk of a certain meeting of Pesca Ministers having been intended to interfere with the independence of action of Parliament."
"Mr Jové Peres was one of the rapporteurs in question and he made a statement this morning."
"I fully accept what he said and if I caused him embarrassment I would like to apologise."
"Colleagues, fifty years ago the first meeting of the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community, the predecessor of the European Parliament, took place here in Strasbourg."
"We celebrate today, therefore, fifty years of parliamentarianism at the heart of our common European project and enterprise, and fifty years of the contribution of parliamentarians to sustained and sustainable peace with prosperity."
"On that occasion on 10 September 1952, Jean Monnet, as President of the High Authority, welcomed 'the first European Assembly invested with the power of decision'."
"The next speaker on that day was Konrad Adenauer who said that the new Assembly 'marked fresh and significant progress in our project of creating a new Europe'."
"Today on behalf of the Parliament I acknowledge and salute that illustrious post-war generation of the pioneers of European integration: in paying tribute to their indelible achievements, we today pledge our own energies as a directly elected European Parliament and pledge our own commitment to serve the rising generation of Europeans across our entire continent, as we move to embrace the historic and unprecedented enlargement that now awaits us."
"To mark this anniversary, I would like to invite you to participate in a ceremony which will take place today at 1 p.m. in the space next to the hemicycle."
"This will include the raising of the European flag and a short musical performance by a colliery band from the Saar."
"You are all very welcome to attend."
"I would also like to remind you of an invitation to the opening of an exhibition about the history of the European Parliament and European integration."
"The exhibition, entitled 'A story with a future' will be formally opened at 2.45 p.m. this afternoon in the Visitors' area on the ground floor of the Louise Weiss building."
"I would now like to welcome to the distinguished visitors' gallery a delegation of five senators and seven members of parliament from Chile."
"The delegation is led by Senator Gabriel Valdés, Chairman of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee."
"The delegation is in Strasbourg to take part in the Fourth Interparliamentary Meeting between the European Parliament and Chile which is being held today and tomorrow."
"As you know, the European Union and Chile have signed an agreement on economic partnership, political coordination and cooperation."
"On behalf of Parliament I welcome the delegation and wish them a successful interparliamentary meeting."
"The next item is the vote."
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0287/2002) by Lord Inglewood, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive concerning life assurance (7328/1/2002 - C5-0230/2002 - 2000/0162(COD))"

"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, in item 21 of the report we demand a proposal from the Commission 'during summer 2002'."
"Since summer has already gone, I want to change this to 'no later than the end of 2002'."
"I am sure the House will agree to that."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0294/2002) by Philip Charles Bradbourn, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system (COM(2002) 54 - C5-0054/2002 - 2002/0038(COD))"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Report Smet (A5-0279/2002)"
"Mr President, this report was also voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure which allows for no debate and no amendments to the report."
"The British delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support."
"The new rule, however, leaves us no option but to vote against certain reports."
"Most of this report represents the very worse of politically correct claptrap."
"Women are increasingly achieving more top positions in society and this will continue to improve as, in my country at least, women are more successful than men in gaining university places."
"We do not support quotas or interference in the ways in which trades unions, for example, select their officers."
"The Committee on Women's Affairs and Equal Opportunities talks about gender mainstreaming whilst at the same time its very existence contradicts this principle."
"The Moderate Party's delegation to the European Parliament has voted against Mrs Smet's report on the representation of women among the social partners of the European Union (A5-0279/2002)."
"The principle of equal rights for all is one of the most important cornerstones of our society."
"Rights are, and shall remain, individual."
"The collectivisation of rights can be the first step towards the reduction of their importance."
"The European Parliament should as a matter of principle not pronounce on how independent organisations, such as employers organisations and trade unions, should be structured."
"This is up to them and their members."
"Otherwise, the Moderate delegation considers that the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities should be abolished and that its business should be taken over by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Mrs Miet Smet's excellent report once again provides us with the opportunity to condemn the dearth of European statistics on the number of women in the social partner organisations."
"Although many strategies have been implemented in order to remedy the underrepresentation of women in the upper echelons of these organisations, as well as in delegations to social consultation and advisory bodies, we must, as the rapporteur recommends, make a start at European level on the systematic compilation of data relating to the role played by women in the decision-making process."
"It is, however, certain that the application and effectiveness of the measures taken remain entirely dependent on the political will within the organisations."
"Awareness-raising campaigns prior to trade union elections and the establishment of networks among women negotiators also constitute incentives for increasing the representation of women."
"After reading this excellent report, I can only recommend that you vote in favour and reiterate that the Commission must urgently compile these data in the proper fashion with a view to creating a database on the representation of women within social partner organisations."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (DE) I voted in favour of the report on the representation of women among the social partners of the European Union."
"According to statistics produced by the European Trade Union Congress, the proportion of women in positions of leadership is under 25%, which is far too low."
"I believe that it is particularly important to achieve balanced representation of women at leadership level in trade unions, which, in wage negotiations, play an important part in promoting equality of opportunity."
"It has emerged from various studies that women are seriously under-represented in wage negotiations, the consequence of which is that women's issues are taken too little into account in the labour market."
"Women know what the real working conditions of female employees are and where equality is lacking."
"If more women were to be in charge of negotiations, I am quite sure that greater consideration would be given to women's interests in the labour market."
"I therefore call on the social partners to devise support programmes for women in order that their presence in decision-making circles may be enhanced."
"The interests of female employees must not be ignored."
"As part of the European Parliament's objective to be proactive in terms of the participation of women in the decision-making bodies of the various organisations, the report by Mrs Miet Smet is an important milestone, and I am pleased to support the report in this House."
"It is extremely important to implement strategies which seek to promote a more balanced representation within social consultation bodies."
"Within these bodies, decisions are taken that are crucial for women, concerning equal opportunities in the workplace and prospects for career progression."
"In order to protect women's interests, we therefore need to compile accurate statistical data, which is the first essential step in achieving a genuinely balanced representation."
"The increased presence of women will thus help to create new points of view on all the policies defined by the social partners."
"This report is heading in this direction and must be given backing so that the European Parliament can gain further credibility in terms of its objectives."
"This will require the cooperation of social partners, and particularly of employer organisations whose efforts, it must be said, are lacking in this area."
"It is clear that this report is also applicable to the framework of enlargement, and that it is important to start to involve the candidate countries immediately in the process of making the presence of women more balanced."
"Mr President, this report was voted under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no debate and no amendment to the report."
"The British delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support."
"The new Rule, however, leaves no option but to vote against certain reports."
"Whilst we support much of what the Hulthén report contains, and of course its objectives, we could not vote in favour of a package that contains references to European eco-taxes."
"Tax is a matter for Member States."
"It is not within the competence of the European Union."
". (EL) The Anneli Report is well intentioned and proposes practicable ways of keeping to the first phase of Tokyo Protocol commitments, although it also expresses reservations about numerous shortcomings in the text."
"The most important points are:"
"One: a directive needs to be approved for the promotion of combined heat and solar energy which will safeguard low costs and high output."
"Two: the same priority should be given to a directive on the promotion of biofuel-based heat production."
"Three: the Commission needs to submit a communication on quantitative environmental targets in the transport sector by the end of 2002, so that transport also contributes to the 8% Kyoto reduction target in the gas emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect, stressing the need for all motor vehicles to be included in the strategy to reduce CO2 emissions."
"We need to favour fuels and technologies with low or zero emissions."
"It is very important that we promote the use of biofuel and the use of ecological fuels in the transport sector."
"Four: in industry, the Commission should immediately propose a framework directive on fluorinated gases in order to reduce emissions in all sectors."
"Five: a proposal for a directive on more energy-efficient public procurement should also be issued immediately."
"Six: at a political level, the European Union should condemn the USA's lack of environmental measures and its efforts to undermine the Kyoto Protocol as a minimum reaction to the USA's failure to take any action."
"We have voted in favour of Mrs Hulthén's report, (A5-0237/2002)."
"For us Swedish Moderates, the most important environmental issue is to avoid development that can cause climate change on our planet."
"To us, it is obvious that the use of carbon for energy production must be phased out."
"Work on environmental policy must be more clearly focused on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases."
"We have voted in favour of the present report as we consider that attempts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and achieve the targets in the Kyoto Protocol are important."
"This does not mean, however, that we support the report in its entirety."
"Items 16, 26, 34 and 35 advocate the coordination and harmonisation of environmental and energy taxation."
"We are opposed to the EU managing the taxes of the Member States."
"A decision must also be made on environmental taxes in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"A carbon dioxide tax might need to vary among the Member States, since it must be set off against other measures that the Member States need to take to achieve the lower emission targets."
"."
"(NL) Freight transport by road has increased considerably over the past 20 years."
"This has led to bottlenecks and pressure to keep widening motorways and to build new roads."
"This form of transport takes up a great deal of space, is noisy and contributes significantly to the greenhouse effect."
"The Commission is right to conclude that this problem must be addressed by shifting from the roads to rail, inland shipping and coastal shipping."
"A majority on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism are opposed to this and want to spare road traffic."
"A modal shift is said to be too costly, and the alternatives are also faced with shortages of capacity and environmental objections."
"It is true that the often ageing diesel locomotives should become cleaner and that the canal network has been neglected."
"This is now being seized on as an argument for handing out subsidies to restrict pollution and congestion on the roads."
"Furthermore, the thresholds for those subsidies are being halved."
"It is also true that the remaining road traffic should become cleaner."
"Nevertheless, I fear that although the EU will be handing out much more funding, little will actually change as a result."
"Road transport will then get the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the necessary environmental investments, and demand for more motorways will continue to rise."
"I voted in favour of this important report, bearing clearly in mind the worrying predictions of the Commission, which suggest that road freight transport in the European Union will increase by around 50% by 2010."
"I fully share the objectives of the Marco Polo programme, and the rapporteur's view on how to reduce road congestion and improve the environmental performance of the worldwide transport system."
"I also believe that congestion constitutes a threat both to the environment and to the vitality of the economy and am, therefore, in favour of measures that reduce congestion and pollution and encourage the transfer of freight transport from road to rail, inland waterways and short sea shipping."
"We must also pay attention, however, to areas in which bottlenecks occur and the factors causing these in these other modes of transport, so that the Marco Polo programme does not lead to a transfer of congestion from one mode of transport to another."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group I should like to say I was disappointed to see that Amendment 6 from the Committee went through."
"This whole directive was really about cross-border legal aid."
"To take the whole cross-border element out, and to try and look at the whole question of harmonising legal aid throughout the European Union, is - in my opinion and that of my Group - bound to lead to one hell of a muddle."
"If we had stuck to the Liberal amendment and had concentrated solely on cross-border legal aid cases, then I think we could have had a workable document in front of us today."
"Unfortunately we do not."
"However, that being said, we did ultimately vote for the directive."
"There are other parts in it which we feel we can support, and we leave the Council of Ministers, hopefully, to sort out the bits that unfortunately went through."
"In the wake of the attacks of 11 September, the Council urged the Commission to examine urgently the links between maintaining domestic security and respecting international obligations in the area of the right to asylum."
"The Commission's approach was disappointing, since it dealt with only one issue, that of how to deny terrorists and other criminals the right to asylum."
"This approach equates to viewing the problem through a microscope."
"On the other hand, it is an entirely different question - a much more serious one - that is not even mentioned in the Commission's document: what would happen if a considerable proportion of the population of a third country requested asylum in one or more Member States, because of the risk of oppression in their own country?"
"The world has changed since 1950."
"The Geneva Convention was designed to protect individuals facing persecution."
"Today, due to globalisation and the ease of travel, we must contemplate the fact that, one day, the Convention might be applied by whole populations or millions of refugees who would destabilise our countries."
"This is the pressing issue we now face."
"Governments have a duty to deal with this by supplementing existing legislation with means of protection other than conventional asylum."
"The British Conservative Delegation fully supports greater cooperation between judicial authorities, especially in the execution of judgments and the service of legal process throughout Europe."
"This both assists British business and helps with the completion of the Single Market."
"However, we do not see the measures in this Report as being helpful and its resource implications in offering free legal assistance, regardless of the merits of a case, to anyone who wishes to pursue an action are both naïve and totally impractical."
"The British Conservatives therefore cannot support the measures in this Report."
"It is a fact that the criteria for EMU should have included criteria for combating unemployment in the Member States."
"The quantitative and qualitative targets set at the Lisbon Summit and the fact that promoting high levels of employment was included in the European Union's main objectives has helped fight unemployment and reduce the number of unemployed to 13 million."
"The objective, however, of full employment set in Lisbon is a political commitment by the leading Member States, not a binding legal commitment."
"Nonetheless, in order to combat unemployment in the Member States, European governments need to learn from each other, coordinate their approaches and exchange best practices."
"The proposals in Mr Herman Schmid's report on the guidelines on employment could help us make a careful evaluation of these guidelines."
"What happens, however, when a Member State such as Greece, where unemployment has risen from 6.3% to 11.1% in the ten years between 1990 and 2000, has had the same recommendations on combating unemployment since 1998?"
"Safeguarding employment should be a priority, not an empty gesture."
"We cannot support the report since it advocates coordination within areas that we consider are best dealt with at national level, including the coordination of employment and social policy."
"We consider that these issues should remain at national level, since the differences between the Member States are great and will increase further with enlargement."
"A European policy in these areas cannot take account of the great differences that exist between the Member States."
"We even consider that coordination and harmonisation within these areas could put continued EU cooperation at risk."
"We do not therefore adopt a position on the actual measures in the report, but vote against the report on grounds of principle."
"As we take stock, five years after the European employment strategy was implemented, and before the 2003 guidelines on employment are finally adopted, it is important to reiterate that unemployment is still a scourge, and that it is the main cause of social exclusion."
"That is why several things must be done: we must call on the Commission to analyse the causes of the weak economic growth in the Union and to put forward proposals with a view to encouraging genuine and meaningful growth in order to increase the number of jobs."
"Regarding the method, we must strengthen the role of the national parliaments in the drafting of national action plans; we must give the European Parliament a role, as part of the co-decision process, on questions relating to employment under the open coordination method, and we must also involve the social partners more closely."
"Regarding the substance, we should emphasise the development of local and regional labour markets in order to boost initiatives designed to attract productive investments and to encourage economic balance, social cohesion and job creation in the least-developed areas and regions."
"We must also consider how to improve the integration of legal immigrants in the labour market."
"."
"(NL) The EU and its forerunners have been born from the desire on the part of major international businesses for one unfettered market with a common currency."
"As a result, employers' interests have weighed down heavily on the EU's management structures and EU policy."
"For 50 years, there have been calls for more attention to solidarity with those who will never occupy economic positions of power."
"The trade movement asked for a 'Social Europe', and the Council, the Commission and Parliament created the impression that this social Europe was on its way."
"Three years ago, this ambition was officially abandoned."
"The 2000 social summit in Lisbon was not about pensions, social benefits, reducing working hours, public investments, strengthening public services and economic stability, but about large-scale privatisations and increasing company profits."
"This mind-set was expected to result in winning the competitive battle with America and Japan."
"Unlimited economic growth without redistribution was said to automatically solve all social problems."
"Social policy is now at risk of being made completely subordinate to economic policy."
"This policy completely ignores the fact that the crisis in 1929 could only be halted by active government intervention, as advocated by the economist Keynes."
"Given a declining economy and growing unemployment, the neo-liberal approach is a recipe for certain social disaster."
"My colleague, Mr Herman Schmid, is right to denounce any future adherence to this approach in employment policy."
"Increased levels of unemployment and announcements of new waves of redundancies - that is what we have to show for five years of the European Employment Strategy."
"The European Union's restructuring policy does not create jobs, it restricts them, especially full-time, stable jobs, while so-called growth deprives millions of people of the right to work or offers them a poor substitute in the form of part-time employment, with all the financial and social consequences that has for family life."
"So celebrations are unjustified and do not reflect the real picture, which is that generalised, long-term unemployment - and we are talking decades here - is hovering around 10% and is accompanied by generalised, temporary, short-term forms of employment, for which employers may even be subsidised, in order to artificially reduce the figures by making several unemployed persons share one job."
"Active employment policies are being used as an excuse to subsidise big business while depriving families of even the most basic right to survival."
"The proposed 'employability' model may appear to reduce official unemployment statistics, but it does not reduce the fear, insecurity, unhappiness or poverty of working-class families."
"Pronouncements about combating poverty, full employment and so on are hypocritical and their only objective is to foster self-delusion among the working classes and take the edge off the social problems which the very policy of serving multinational interests creates."
"That is why we call on the workers to rally round and overturn this anti-grass roots policy."
"Although I disagree with some paragraphs, I decided to vote in favour of this report on taking stock of five years of the European Employment Strategy. I particularly welcome the fact that, according to the observations made by the rapporteur on the future of employment in the European Union, businesses will be asked to give greater weight to the family-friendly organisation of work."
"I also welcome the view of lifelong employability as a means of preferential social integration, particularly given the increased ageing of the working population in all the countries of the Union."
"It is becoming increasingly important to focus national employment policies and the European Employment Strategy itself on giving dignity to labour and not only on the economic aspects of harmonising the EU's productivity index with the USA, which is mentioned often in the Commission communication."
"In addition to having to be 'productive', employment must be also a means of achieving one's potential and of social integration."
"The Luxembourg process introduced a new way of working within the EU."
"It involved taking new initiatives to strengthen employment policy in the Union."
"After five years, we can now say that this strategy has been successful, even if there is still much to be improved."
"The open method of coordination is not based on legislation, but on common policy objectives."
"This has proved to be an effective method of managing employment issues."
"Parliament does not have co-decision in the open coordination."
"A role that is based on co-decision, which is now required in recital R in the adopted report, would undermine open coordination as a method."
"As a Swedish Christian Democrat I cannot support this."
"Recital E in the report also criticises the entrepreneurship pillar, stating that the emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises has been too narrow a perspective."
"This statement is in direct contradiction of the political priorities of the Christian Democrats in Sweden."
"For this reason also, I have not been able to support the report."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the report (A5-0296/2002), by Elmar Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on Progress in implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) [7330/2002 - C5-0205/2002 - 2002/2010(INI)],"
"the Council and the Commission statements on the Middle East, and"
"the report (A5-0286/2002), by Gary Titley on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the third annual report on arms exports (operative provision 8 of the code of conduct) [2001/2254(INI)]."
"Two ministers will speak today on behalf of the Council: Mr Møller for the Danish Presidency and Mr Yiannitsis on behalf of the next Greek Presidency."
"As you know, Denmark, as a result of its referenda and Treaty arrangements, is not connected with the dossier on defence issues, and so we have the unusual and perhaps unprecedented situation of a troika in operation in the House."
"We welcome both Mr Møller and Mr Yiannitsis."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Naturally, it is a pleasure to address the European Parliament on the EU's progress within the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"As pointed out in the committee's report, the EU faces major global challenges."
"Both our own populations and third countries expect the EU to be able to help to solve conflicts and calm tensions around the world."
"In my statement here I will concentrate on the following topics: Afghanistan, the fight against terrorism, the Middle East, Iraq, India, Pakistan, Russia and Africa."
"As far as the ICC is concerned, I refer to my other statement."
"My Greek colleague, Mr Tassos Yiannitsis, Minister for Europe, will give an account of aspects of the work in the area of the common security and defence policy, or ESDP."
"As mentioned, I will start with Afghanistan."
"The situation there remains frail, but the Loya Jirga process still provides a good basis on which to build."
"Far more refugees and internally displaced persons than expected have returned home, and that shows that there is hope for the future of their country."
"Unfortunately, Afghanistan still faces very difficult challenges."
"The recent assassination attempt on President Karzai and other terrorist attacks are evidence of the serious security problems."
"Without internal security, neither stable government nor sustainable development can be achieved."
"The role of the central government must therefore be strengthened and the influence of the warlords reduced."
"Civil society and the role and rights of women must similarly be strengthened."
"The Afghan institutions and basic infrastructure must be built up again."
"Reforms must be implemented within the judicial system and police, and a national army under civil control must be established."
"The remaining refugees and displaced persons must be allowed to return, and we must support their reintegration."
"We urgently call upon the international community, including in particular Afghanistan's neighbours, to continue to support a further stabilisation of Afghanistan."
"The UN will play a very central role here through the UN special representative Mr Brahimi."
"The EU will continue to do what is in its power to rebuild the country and to implement the Bonn Agreement fully."
"We promised to do so last week during a special debate at the UN."
"We will maintain our strong commitment to humanitarian and restructuring aid, and the EU will follow the work of the new Afghan human rights commission closely."
"We expect the EU Member States involved to continue contributing to the ISAF troops."
"The Danish Presidency further gives the highest priority to combating terrorism."
"We are implementing the European action plan to combat terrorism as planned."
"We will continue our efforts to incorporate the combating of terrorism into all aspects of EU foreign policy."
"Follow-up by the EU to date has focused on the EU's internal measures, in which considerable progress has been made towards implementation."
"Implementation within the EU of UN Security Council Resolution 1373 on freezing the financial resources of terrorist groups may be mentioned here in particular."
"This work will naturally be continued under the Danish Presidency."
"Moreover, based on the Seville European Council, the EU's action plan and the Council conclusions of 22 July 2002, the Danish Presidency will aim to move EU policy forward as regards the EU's international role in the fight against terrorism, including in particular cooperation with third countries and relevant international organisations."
"In the Seville declaration, the European Council defined the Common Foreign and Security Policy's contribution to the fight against terrorism, including the contribution of the security and defence policy."
"As a follow-up to this, on 22 July the Council approved a number of decisions with a view to implementing the Seville declaration."
"These included a revision of the dimensions relating to combating terrorism through the links with third countries, including such links in the form of conventions and specific measures that can help third countries to meet their obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373."
"The Presidency attaches importance to the Council's conclusions being followed up by practical initiatives."
"A number of concrete steps have already been taken."
"I would also like to say a few words about the non-proliferation and disarmament policy."
"We have earmarked the non-proliferation and disarmament policy for renewed consideration as part of the global fight against terrorism."
"We consider it of great importance that this non-proliferation and disarmament policy should be strengthened and we will be bringing the matter up with all the parties involved in Troika cooperation."
"On 15 April 2002, the Council adopted as many as 42 concrete measures that will help to strengthen multilateral instruments, export controls, cooperation and political dialogue."
"The Danish Presidency faces two great challenges here: firstly, continuing efforts to succeed, in The Hague in November, in implementing the international Code of Conduct against the spread of ballistic missiles and secondly strengthening the convention banning biological and chemical weapons."
"This logically leads me on to Iraq."
"In the Middle East, Iraq still is a serious source of concern as far as weapons of mass destruction are concerned."
"We agree with President Bush on this point, which he emphasised in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly recently."
"Iraq has violated various Security Council resolutions in respect of the country's disarmament obligations."
"The country must comply with these obligations immediately."
"The EU is firmly resolved to support the United Nations' continued efforts in this respect."
"Among other things, the Security Council has demanded that Iraq give the UN weapons inspectors unconditional and unfettered access and ensure that the country's authorities cooperate to the extent required."
"The EU has fully supported this demand."
"On 16 September the Iraqi Government notified the Secretary-General of the UN that it accepted the return of the weapons inspectors."
"The Security Council is now investigating whether the Iraqi notification complies with the Security Council's requirements in respect of the weapons inspections."
"The Presidency agrees with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the Security Council must comply with its responsibilities, should Iraq still refuse to co-operate."
"At this juncture, I would like to say something about the Middle East."
"It is two years now since the violent Israeli-Palestinian conflict broke out again."
"However, a number of positive signs of progress - particularly in the area of reforms - have given cause for cautious optimism in recent times, that is, since the summer."
"The EU's response is that this progress should be utilised for the resumption of political negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians which are able to give both parties concrete prospects of a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"The EU has therefore endeavoured to send a concrete message as to how this aim can be achieved."
"At the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Elsinore on 30-31 August of this year, the EU completed its proposal for a timetable pointing the way towards peace and towards the establishment of a Palestinian state by the summer of 2005."
"This proposal, which gives practical expression to President Bush's vision and to the Arab peace proposal for a Palestinian state within three years - and which largely takes the Arab peace initiative as its starting point - anticipates three phases. Firstly, entry this year into an Israeli-Palestinian security agreement that will stop the violence and pave the way for the Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections that are expected to be held on 20 January 2003."
"Following these elections, negotiations are to be started on the establishment of a Palestinian state with temporary borders, and this is to take place in the autumn of 2003."
"We will then enter the third phase, in which a final peace agreement is to be entered into, adopting positions on the difficult issues of Jerusalem, borders, refugees and settlers which must be solved before the final establishment of a Palestinian state in mid-2005."
"In parallel with this - if we are to achieve a comprehensive peace - efforts must be made to resume the negotiations with Syria and Lebanon, so that the process can lead to an overall peace solution in the Middle East."
"During my trip to the Middle East in early September, the proposal was generally well received by the parties in the region."
"The Arab countries gave the proposal a positive reception."
"The proposal was also welcomed by the Israeli side, although Israel expressed a number of reservations as regards certain elements of the proposal."
"At the meeting of the Middle East Quartet on 17 September this year, agreement was reached that, in the weeks ahead, the Quartet - partly following the EU's lead - will seek to reach agreement on a final joint timetable for the three phases of establishing a Palestinian state by August 2005."
"There was also support for the EU's suggestion of holding an international donor conference on support for the Palestinian reform process by the end of the year."
"The Danish EU Presidency has offered to host the conference and thus also the meeting of the Quartet that is expected to be held in connection with the donor conference."
"The EU and the Presidency are working in accordance with the declaration made by the Seville European Council on the holding of an early peace conference which will be able to discuss and reach agreement on a timetable for the road ahead towards lasting peace in the Middle East."
"I have noted that, in its recent report on developments in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy also shares this approach."
"The members of the Middle East Quartet have agreed to continue discussions on the date and modalities of such an international peace conference."
"My clear impression is that the members of the Quartet take a fairly similar view of the situation and that we will therefore be able to achieve a common timetable relatively quickly."
"The Danish Presidency intends to continue this policy and to work actively towards a detailed timetable which can pave the way for a peaceful solution to one of the most enduring conflicts in recent history."
"I also note that yesterday's security resolution specifically mentions the necessity of the EU's and the Quartet's peace plan, or timetable, moving forward despite what happened last week."
"What happened - as all of you here know - is that there were two suicide attacks in Israel."
"That bodes ill as regards achieving the progress that was otherwise on the way following the summer's task forces and working groups, following endorsement by the Quartet and the expansion of the EU's plan for peace."
"Now we have had these serious setbacks."
"Otherwise we would have had reason for optimism, because partly thanks to the EU's intervention Fatah and Tanzim had declared a moratorium on attacks on Israeli civilians."
"However, last week's actions show that militant groups such as Islamic Jihad have no intention of complying with Fatah and Tanzim's moratorium."
"The Presidency has expressed to both parties its great regret about both the Palestinian suicide bombings and the Israeli retaliation."
"Israel has the right to fight terrorism, but the fierce Israeli retaliation - including the siege and bombardment of President Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah - will not bring peace and security to the Israeli and Palestinian people."
"In recent days, the Presidency has been in close contact with the parties about the situation as well as with Russia, the USA and Egypt, and we have sent representatives to the region."
"It is crucial that the heralded American/Jordanian/Egyptian support of Palestinian police and security forces is put into effect very quickly so that there is a unified security system on the Palestinian side with which Israel feels reasonably secure."
"We must not let the radical groups derail the political initiatives yet again."
"Radical groups also threaten peace in the relationship between India and Pakistan, which remains tense."
"The EU is still prepared to contribute to the international efforts to reduce the current crisis, to promote measures to create confidence and to create the conditions for dialogue between the parties on a lasting solution to the conflict."
"Local elections are currently being held in Jammu and Kashmir."
"The run-up to the elections has been violent and has given cause for concern."
"However, it is our hope that the elections in Jammu and Kashmir will be able to pave the way for a resumption of the dialogue between India and Pakistan on a long-term solution."
"India has opposed international election observers, but representatives of a number of EU countries' embassies in New Delhi will be present during the elections."
"I now turn to Europe and to our nearest neighbour, Russia."
"It goes without saying that how the EU gets on with Russia and how Russia gets on with us plays a crucial role in the peaceful development of Europe."
"The lead-up to the summit between the EU and Russia, which will take place in Copenhagen on 11 November 2002, will provide us with an opportunity to take stock of five years of partnership and cooperation."
"We will face new challenges in connection with enlargement."
"We all know that."
"In the first instance, the Presidency attaches particular importance to finding a rapid solution to the issue of the Kaliningrad enclave."
"On 30 September the Council will discuss the investigation of this issue carried out by the Commission in order, in consultation with Poland and Lithuania, to find a solution complying with current Community law."
"Russia is included in our strategy for the Northern Dimension, but we also intend to present a strategy for our new neighbours, since with the forthcoming enlargement there will naturally be a need to consider a new overall strategy in respect of the European Union's neighbouring states to the east following enlargement, that is, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova."
"The purpose of such a strategy will be to encourage democratic and economic reforms in the neighbouring countries and to strengthen cross-border cooperation with these countries."
"On 30 September 2002 the Council will go through the contributions that have already been received concerning the European Union's links with its new neighbours."
"A communication that the Commission will present in the course of the autumn will naturally supplement these deliberations and hopefully lead to a decision in December."
"Now I will move away from Europe and move down to Africa."
"As you all know, critical conditions prevail in southern Africa, where the EU is concerned at the worsening of the situation in Zimbabwe - including the latest attacks on the media, the continuing spiteful actions against farmers and President Mugabe's appointment of a new hard-line government which is being called a 'war cabinet'."
"On 22 July the EU tightened up its restrictions against Zimbabwe by adding a number of names to the list of people covered by the travel ban."
"At the same time, the EU decided to continue cooperating with other international parties with a view to finding a solution in Zimbabwe."
"The restrictions introduced by the EU are aimed at people whom we regard as responsible for the crisis in the country."
"The EU will, however, continue to support Zimbabwe's population - which is suffering from the consequences of Mugabe's policies - by sending massive quantities of food aid which will ease the famine in the country and by offering social and medical assistance."
"The EU notes with increasing concern that a food crisis is rapidly developing in southern Africa and that the humanitarian situation is deteriorating."
"The Community and its Member States have already responded by offering the region food and humanitarian aid to a value of EUR 490 million."
"This aid initiative is being targeted at those countries hardest hit - namely Zimbabwe, Malawi and Zambia."
"A number of political decisions and measures taken by the governments in the region, particularly that of Zimbabwe, have further contributed to worsening the already alarming humanitarian situation."
"We have therefore made it clear that under no circumstances must food aid be used as a political tool and that the recipient countries must ensure that it is distributed fairly and entirely without political considerations."
"Finally, allow me to express the Presidency's satisfaction with the course of the summit that we have just had in Copenhagen - the ASEM Summit."
"It is my impression that everyone from the Asian countries and the European countries were pleased with the summit."
"In addition to informal talks, concrete initiatives were put on the table which we will now work on further, including youth games staged in Asia."
"We also want to strengthen links between Europe and Asia; there are great opportunities for cooperation not only in the economic sphere, but also in the political and cultural spheres."
"Before I hand over now to Mr Tassos Yiannitsis I would like to say that I agree with the report's remarks on the EU's successful work in the Balkans."
"The EU has succeeded in bringing a region characterised by dissolution and instability back into the general development of Europe."
"With the takeover of the UN police mission in Bosnia on 1 January 2003 the EU will make another substantial contribution to promoting stability further in the Balkans."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, it is a very great honour, as deputy Foreign Minister of Greece, to address you today on the aspects of European security and defence policy with military and defence implications."
"I should particularly like to take this opportunity of thanking the Danish Presidency for the way in which it has cooperated on this novel experiment by the dual presidency, which is no easy task."
"May I start by saying that the Belgian and Spanish Presidencies were especially productive and gave a tremendous fillip to the European security and defence policy and it is befitting for us to acknowledge that from this forum."
"There has been a whole series of developments which I should like to mention."
"The first, and perhaps most important, is the official announcement in Laeken last year that the European Union is now ready to carry out certain operations and is gradually moving towards full operational capability which will allow it to take on even the most demanding of Petersburg-type missions."
"The second point I wanted to mention concerns the development of military capabilities, which are perhaps the most important factor in completing the Union's operational capabilities and which have also made considerable progress."
"A conference was held on improving capabilities, giving both the Member States and third countries the opportunity to make additional contributions, and the action plan on capabilities was adopted in Laeken."
"The Spanish Presidency also pushed on with the application of the plan in question, and I should like to acknowledge that."
"May I point out that the announcement of partial operational readiness in Laeken is not simply of theoretical value."
"It says that we have the political will to implement the CFSP mechanism, even if it is still unfinished."
"What this means in practice is that we have given the go-ahead for specific operations to be undertaken in the Balkans, such as the policing mission in Bosnia and Task Force Fox in the FYROM."
"The Spanish Presidency also seriously addressed the related matter of equipment and took the relevant initiatives."
"My fourth point concerns the European Union's first exercise, which was conducted during the Spanish Presidency and allowed the procedures planned to be tested and conclusions to be drawn which will be invaluable in improving these procedures in the future."
"And as part of this procedural operational framework for the defence and security policy mechanism, I should also mention that framework guidelines defining the funding system for military operations, which is again a very important aspect, were adopted in Seville."
"A great deal has, of course, been done to set up the mechanism for developing capabilities which, in turn, is the basic tool of military administration."
"Much of the work has already been done and all that remains is to enhance certain points so that the mechanism can be put into action."
"However, there are a few outstanding questions, such as relations between the European Union and ???? and the related issue of the involvement of European allies who are not part of the European Union."
"As far as the first question is concerned, progress has not been exactly spectacular."
"Unquestionably, some progress has been made, mainly following discussions within ???? of individual issues pertaining to relations between the two organisations."
"However, it is true to say, by way of a general conclusion, that relations between the two organisations need to progress further."
"The reason given for this in certain quarters is the delay in dealing with the outstanding issue of participation."
"I should like to point out that this is not entirely accurate because, although resolving this issue would certainly make it easier to complete permanent arrangements, the fact that it is outstanding is no reason to delay on individual matters."
"Here too, progress has been made, as noted in the Seville conclusions, thanks to the efforts of the Spanish Presidency which, working with the General Secretariat and with the help of certain partners actively involved in the overall issue, brokered a compromise proposal before Seville."
"Unfortunately, this proposal has still not been developed."
"However, the Presidency and the General Secretariat are continuing in their endeavours, as instructed in Seville."
"As far as relations with third countries are concerned, significant progress was also made in Seville, which adopted arrangements to broaden the provisions made in Nice on the involvement in European defence and security policy of potential partners, such as Canada, Russia and the Ukraine."
"As far as the European Union's taking over the Task Force Fox operation in the FYROM is concerned, serious preparations have also been made here."
"However, given that one of the sine qua non for taking over this operation is that permanent arrangements have to be in place between the European Union and ????, which there appears to be little likelihood of completing by the end of October, we may have to examine alternatives."
"Of course, this does not reflect all the progress made on the CFSP over the last year."
"A great deal of more or less important progress has been made, but there is too little time to describe it all."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European defence enterprise is helping to satisfy the demands of European citizens, which are being voiced even more loudly at the moment, for the European Union to take a strong lead on defence issues."
"The European Parliament, with its direct links to the citizens of Europe and with its sensitive approach to important issues in the European Union, will, we are sure, help with this new dimension currently being structured in the European Union."
"We are aware of the fact that, with the CFSP, we are opening up new prospects for the European Union and the cooperation established at the outset is very important."
"For our part, we shall do our very best during our presidency."
"To close, I should like to thank the European Parliament and its president for giving me the opportunity to present the defence aspects of the policy for which Greece has assumed the presidency during the current six-month term."
"Mr President, I have been asked to respond to both the Brok and Titley reports and to make a statement on the Middle East as well."
"I should like to begin with the report by Mr Brok."
"This offers a very good overview of the progress achieved and the new challenges that emerged in 2001/2002."
"When we met here 11 months ago to discuss the previous CFSP Report, we had just been hit by the terrorist attacks in the United States and the war in Afghanistan."
"The picture today has changed dramatically."
"The impact of 11 September on world politics has been immense."
"I agree with Mr Brok that there are currently four major tasks for our Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"None of them are easily met: firstly there is our partnership with the United States."
"The complexity and diversity of this indispensable partnership inevitably generate a certain degree of friction."
"We stand united against terrorism, we share similar values."
"But our interpretation of these values is not always identical."
"United States leadership since the war has been based on two pillars, represented perhaps by the work of President Truman and General Marshall: first containment of threat; second the establishment of a global rule book and of global institutions which could encourage democracy, open markets and the rule of law, both on continents and internationally."
"That approach, which produced so much prosperity and stability for the last half of the last century, is still the right approach today."
"That is why all Members in this House are united in thinking that the right way of approaching the problem of Iraq is through the means of the United Nations."
"In our cooperation with the US, but also more generally, the European Union has shown resolve in the pursuit of this multilateral approach to foreign policy."
"We strongly believe that multilateral arrangements and conventions, the UN, the G8, the OSCE and others are the key to tackling the security, development and environmental problems which confront the world."
"The structures of ESDP and its relationship with NATO are of particular concern."
"I am worried that despite almost indefatigable efforts of many, the Berlin-plus issue remains unsettled with consequences, as we know, for our aspirations in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Finally, bilateral relations have continued to expand in the past year with virtually all major countries in the world."
"Among them, Russia is an increasingly important strategic partner."
"Today, we have an ambitious, comprehensive, bilateral agenda with Russia, including a structured and intensive dialogue on Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"This partnership also helps us to address sensitive issues like Chechnya."
"I broadly agree with Mr Brok's remarks regarding the agenda of our regional policies."
"The report includes a series of proposals which are welcome, such as the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean parliamentary assembly, fresh initiatives for our partnerships with Asia and Latin America and support to the New Partnership for Africa's Development in sub-Saharan Africa (NEPAD)."
"There are four issues that I would like to touch on in particular."
"In the Western Balkans we need to ensure that we work together to preserve the integrity of the stabilisation and association process."
"Those agreements should not be seen as political goodwill signals."
"It is in no-one's interest to finalise agreements with countries before the objective criteria for an agreement have been fulfilled."
"Regarding Iraq, I spoke to the House on this subject earlier this month and said that we must continue to press for full Iraqi compliance with the UN resolutions."
"The political action on Iraq at present is in New York and that is exactly where it should be."
"Afghanistan is an issue I remain seriously concerned about."
"The assassination attempt on President Karzai and the bomb in central Kabul earlier this month are just the most recent examples of the fragility of Afghanistan."
"We must not spare efforts to help the central government extend its authority to the entire country."
"At the UN, in the margins of the General Assembly, I attended an important meeting of Afghanistan's principal aid donors at which we underlined the importance of delivering as rapidly as possible on our respective pledges."
"The regional agenda, important as it is, must not stop us from thinking ahead."
"There are long-term strategic issues that we need to keep in sight."
"There is firstly, for example, the institutional framework for the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"The architecture of the treaties is complex and our work on CFSP is right at the institutional frontiers."
"The work of the Convention will soon produce new proposals to improve the present arrangements."
"I look forward to participating in the discussions of the Dehaene Working Group."
"Secondly, there are preparations for the consequences of enlargement on CFSP and ESDP."
"Enlargement will have a major impact on the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Together with the Danish Presidency, we have started thinking about the consequences of this."
"We have to make CFSP structures responsive enough to cater for 10 or more new Member States."
"Through the Wider Europe initiative we will look more closely into how to organise relations, and whenever possible, seek partnership with the 'near abroad' in the East, the South-East and the South."
"Thirdly I should mention Crisis Management and Conflict Prevention which must become a cross-cutting issue for all CFSP and external relations initiatives."
"Our work on conflict indicators will be instrumental in gearing diplomatic action and aid programming towards conflict prevention and crisis management."
"We need to implement the Göteborg programme for the prevention of violent conflict and we need to further strengthen our human rights and democracy promotion policies."
"There are many examples of how CFSP yields operational results when we effectively pool national and EU resources, both in the Commission and in the Council."
"I look forward to working with Parliament on improving our mechanisms for this and in extending full democratic control and accountability to the field of CFSP."
"But I must say, and I hope it will not be regarded as a revolutionary observation, that however much we discuss improving instruments, however much we discuss institutional architecture, in my judgment on the basis of three years' experience there is no substitute for political will."
"Secondly, let me refer briefly to the admirable report by Mr Titley on the code of conduct on arms exports."
"That code is politically binding on the Member States, and the Commission has a limited role in this process."
"We nevertheless welcome progress made in the Council with respect to improving the implementation of the code and enhancing transparency provided through the annual report."
"We welcome Parliament's intensive interest in this subject and in particular the constructive and very ambitious stance of Mr Titley's report which encourages the Council to pursue and improve further its work in this area."
"We share several of the suggestions presented in the report, such as those referring to arms-brokering activities and the production of military goods under licence, as well as the control of the end user of arms exports."
"We also welcome the suggestions for all Member States to publish national annual reports for ensuring the maximum involvement of the accession countries in information exchange and denial notification as well as for promoting adherence to the principles of the code by third countries."
"The Presidency has spoken about the Middle East and about the positive atmosphere at our Quartet meeting of 17 September."
"I am sure Parliament is aware of the huge amount of work the Danish Presidency put into the preparation of this meeting."
"It was constructive and the meeting served to set the basis for a possible peace plan, as well as for further international support for Palestinian reform."
"Unfortunately the situation on the ground gives no reason to believe that things will get any better soon."
"There was a six-week period of calm - calm of a sort, at any rate, even though during that period 50 Palestinians were killed."
"Then there were the despicable suicide bombings."
"There was also the bombing of the Palestinian school and so the violence increased again."
"To be fair there were some signs of improvement which have passed largely unacknowledged."
"We were encouraged by the declaration of Fatah/Tanzim of their intention to stop attacks on Israeli civilians."
"Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called the Fatah document a 'first dawn of a different season, hopefully' he added, 'spring'."
"But this new understanding seems to have evaporated and the Palestinian Authority and President Arafat have again become the target of an assault in retaliation for suicide attacks by those who do not believe in peace."
"Let me stress once again - as I have done on several occasions in this House - that we must continue insisting that the Palestinian Authority does everything possible to stop terrorism."
"We should exert the utmost pressure on the Palestinian Authority to prevent terror attacks and to bring terrorists to justice."
"But how does it help the cause of peace to deprive the Palestinian Authority of the power and means to do any of these things?"
"How does it improve security to destroy the Palestinian Authority?"
"How does the isolation and attempted humiliation of President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority contribute to the fight against terror?"
"Or, for that matter, attempts to drive him into exile."
"No wonder the Secretary-General of the United Nations described Israeli policy this week as bankrupt, as being likely to increase extremism rather than reduce it."
"On a less gloomy note, the Quartet reviewed the Palestinian reform process which seems to be on track in as much as this is possible under the current situation."
"The reform of financial and budgetary management is continuing with European Union support and under European Union pressure."
"In this context I welcome - as a positive first step - the decision by Israel to pay USD 45 million in frozen tax transfers to the Palestinian Authority through the same bank account and the same monitoring mechanism which was set up as a result of our support to the Palestinian Authority."
"I repeat: through the same bank account and using the same monitoring mechanism which was set up as a result of the efforts of the European Commission and the European Union."
"I hope that the irony of that remark is not lost on some of those who have been criticising the efforts that we have made in order to promote the cause of reform in the Palestinian Authority."
"And I hope that Israel will immediately release the remaining money."
"A wide sector of Palestinian society regards elections as a crucial part of the reform process."
"The pressure for elections must be maintained."
"The events in the Palestinian Legislative Council over the past week and the resignation of the Palestinian Cabinet shows the emergence of a real democratic debate within Palestinian society."
"This is a very positive sign of parliamentary life."
"I sincerely hope that a new Palestinian Cabinet dedicated to the reform process is formed soon and that the achievements of the past few months are not destroyed."
"The European Union is ready to provide assistance if there is a minimum guarantee that the elections will be free and fair."
"Whilst we fully support Palestinian elections and the need for Palestinian people to elect their own leadership, we continue to caution against elections if the legal, administrative and logistic framework for elections, including the political environment, is not in place."
"And how can those things be in place if there are closures, if there are curfews, if there are tanks in the streets?"
"But despite the progress on the reform agenda the humanitarian and economic situation continues to deteriorate."
"This has been recently highlighted by UN envoy Catherine Bertini in her sobering report on the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories: two thirds of the population is under the poverty line and up to half of the population is currently unemployed."
"The situation must dramatically improve if we are to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe."
"But we must do much more than fighting the symptoms of the crisis."
"We must address its causes."
"Providing humanitarian assistance can only be a short-term approach - improving the economy must be our goal."
"Let me mention here that the European Union's humanitarian work is severely affected by the restriction of movement, not just within the Palestinian Territories but on arrival at the border."
"This year so far we have had over 20 cases of Israel denying entry to EU humanitarian teams."
"Finally, the Quartet agreed to hold in November a ministerial-level meeting of the Ad-Hoc Liaison Committee, involving the major donors in the international community."
"The meeting will review the economic and humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as efforts to support and encourage the reform process in the Palestinian Authority, including the prospects for elections."
"I should like to bring to Parliament's attention the fact that donors will inevitably be asked to identify the possibilities of additional funding."
"I should warn Parliament I am likely to come back to Parliament and the Budgetary Authority as a whole on this in the near future."
"Over the last six months we have made some political progress."
"The perspectives are much clearer now; and the Palestinians and the donor community are working hard on building institutions and reforming existing structures."
"But there is a danger of this becoming a sort of virtual politics, while the real situation on the ground goes from bad to worse to appalling."
"Every day we talk of peace; every day people die - Palestinians, Israelis. How much longer must this go on?"
"How much longer must Israelis and Palestinians live in Gethsemane?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for having responded to comments that the rapporteur has not even made yet."
"As you are in charge of the sitting, I would like to remind you of the following, which is to be found in Rule 120(5) of our Rules of Procedure: 'In a debate on a report, the Commission and the Council shall, as a rule, be given the floor immediately after the rapporteur's explanation.'"
"It must surely be clear to you that, whilst the Council is allowed an explanation, it is the report that is on the agenda."
"I do not believe that this is a right or careful way to handle the work of committees in the plenary."
"Thank you very much!"
"Thank you, Mr Brok, for the point of order."
"As you know, we have a joint debate, including two reports and statements."
"In the context of the joint debate it was the collective will of the political groups to follow the order as indicated."
"I am the servant of the political groups in the matter of deciding the agenda, and, in view of the fact that this is a joint debate and not just a debate on reports, it seems to me that it is within the discretion of the groups to seek to order the debate as they have done."
"If you object to this, if you do not wish to pursue that precedent for the future, I would ask you to raise your objections inside the political groups."
"This is a joint debate, it is not only a debate on reports."
"I am not going to entertain a debate on this."
"The point is noted, but this is not the place to resolve the matter."
"Mr President, Mr Møller, Commissioner Patten, Mr Yiannitsis, ladies and gentlemen, a debate such as today's is an occasion on which to take stock of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, highlighting its positive aspects, whilst not omitting those that merit criticism."
"I would like first to extend my very warm thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Brok and Mr Titley, for the excellent reports that they have produced."
"Mr Swoboda, we can talk about that some other time."
"I would have had no objections to the two rapporteurs presenting their reports, but that was not my decision, nor do I have any reason to question the President's rulings, so that is not a question for me, and I am therefore not going to comment on it."
"The positive elements of European foreign policy include a topic that we have not yet mentioned at all, that is, the accession of the central European countries to the European Union."
"That is, indeed, at present still a foreign policy matter, and when these countries join the European Union, it will be a matter for internal affairs."
"That we will soon - we hope, by the end of year - be concluding negotiations with what are obviously ten European countries, is in fact a great success story."
"It is one of the great European political successes."
"Reference has been made to the Balkans, and that is also a positive development."
"There, the European Union is playing a positive part in the interests of stability, security and democracy."
"Afghanistan has been mentioned, and here too Europeans have been active; 13 of the 15 EU States are involved in Afghanistan, whether militarily or in other ways."
"What is actually astonishing is that, although we - by which I mean the European Union and its Member States - are the greatest donors of funds, this actually goes almost without being noticed."
"When the Americans donate a million dollars somewhere or other, then the whole world gets to know about it."
"When we donate a billion euro, I sometimes get the impression that it is the best kept of Europe's state secrets."
"We have to give some thought to how we can make our public relations work even better."
"Turning to Iraq, we very much support the American President's efforts to involve the United Nations in this issue, and we call on all Member States of the European Union to take up a common position as Europeans together."
"We see it as irresponsible for one or more Member States to go their own way."
"Not only does it do damage to that country's relationship with the United States of America, but it also shows a lack of solidarity with Europeans in the European Union, for we can influence American policy and global politics only if we Europeans act together."
"We now have to require the Iraqi dictator to open up his country to inspections - the British Government produced an important document on the subject yesterday - and, if these inspections on the ground are not feasible, then it is the Iraqi dictator who, at the end of the day, bears the responsibility if military action has to be taken."
"I can endorse everything that Commissioner Patten said on the subject of the Middle East."
"Whilst we remain convinced that the escalation of violence must be halted, and that terrorism by suicide commando must come to an end, Israel's responses are quite disproportionate; the Palestinians, too, have their own dignity."
"I can, then, only encourage the Council and the Commission to stick to their policy of talking to both sides in reasonable terms."
"There are others who do not do it in this way, and we have an important part to play, as both sides trust us - one perhaps rather more than the other."
"We Europeans must cooperate with those whose dignity is being violated."
"What we are saying, with the utmost clarity, is that Israel has the right to live within secure borders, but the Palestinian people also have the right to live in peace and within secure borders."
"The representatives of the Palestinian people must also be given opportunities to express their views and suggest sensible ways ahead for the future."
"Mr Yiannitsis, the deputy defence minister of Greece, was right to point out that there is as yet no agreement between the European Union and NATO on access to the North Atlantic Alliance's planning facilities and military capabilities."
"We hope that we will soon be able to come to an arrangement, and also call upon our Turkish partners to contribute towards finding a solution."
"I will conclude by observing that Commissioner Patten referred to the need to improve Europe's foreign, security and defence policy instruments."
"We hope that the Convention will make important proposals on this, and if the European Union is to be able to act and commit itself as it is in Afghanistan, then effective institutions must be the outward expression of this."
"Our group will therefore do all in its power to make the Convention a success, for on this will depend to a great extent the European Union's success with its Common Foreign, Security and Defence Policy."
"(Applause)"
"How can we prevent the United States from taking unilateral action in future, or from carrying out preventive attacks, wherever and whenever, even without our approval?"
"Simply invoking the United Nations and international law is not enough as a formula to change Washington from a unilateral to a multilateral player."
"Only if the European Union organises itself more effectively on a political and military plane can it be a worthy Atlantic partner."
"However, as long as European leaders set greater store by internal political considerations than they do by common foreign policy, our endeavours in this area will be in vain and we will continue to give America all the political leeway it needs to determine its own agenda."
"This particularly applies with regard to Iraq."
"The European Union must sail a liberal course midway between two Social-Democratic extremes: Mr Schröder, the electoral opportunist, and Mr Blair, President Bush's London branch manager."
"The pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow unfettered access to all weapons and to destroy all dangerous weapons must be stepped up to the highest level possible."
"Needless to say, possible military action cannot be ruled out then."
"After all, if we continue to allow Saddam Hussein to ignore the UN resolutions, he will become a great danger to his environment and the UN Security Council itself."
"Military action does, of course, require the Security Council's explicit approval."
"If the international community joins forces, the Atlantic allies will have to follow suit."
"Only with Europe's help can America tackle the problems in the world effectively."
"Political and cultural differences should not make us blind to Europe's and America's common interests."
"Although the enlarged EU can add more weight globally, decision-making must be adapted and the right to veto must be abolished."
"It remains crucial, though, for a common foreign policy in Europe to become more important than the political leaders' own national profile."
"If that does not change, we only have ourselves to blame for America being able to take global control on its own."
"Mr President, the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council on the Middle East gave me great cause for alarm, because there are, even so, few or hardly any regions of the world in a state of conflict that has such a profound impact on global stability."
"There are few regions in which a State breaches international law, humanitarian law and United Nations' resolutions to such a degree and quite so repeatedly, and there is certainly no State associated with the Union which treats Europe in such an off-hand way, destroying Palestinian infrastructures that we have financed, which refuses, first Mr Solana, then Mr Moratinos, the right to visit an occupied Palestinian territory."
"And there is, above all, no State which treats the appeals that we make to it with such scorn, practically torpedoing the peace efforts on which we are working."
"It is in this context that the President-in-Office of the Council speaks of optimism and sees the main obstacle to peace to be the Palestinians."
"I cannot comprehend this!"
"You are obviously right to condemn outright the suicide attacks and any act of terrorism against innocent people, in Israel just as in any other country."
"The Palestinian Authority also condemns them systematically and has often tried to put a stop to them."
"But what has Mr Sharon done during the last six weeks of relative calm to try to dispel the tension and re-launch the dialogue?"
"The Ha'aretz newspaper answers for you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in pointing out that 30 Palestinian civilians were killed in August alone and Yedioth Ahronot, another newspaper, condemned the irresponsible nature of these crimes, although, apparently, the number of terrorist attacks has fallen spectacularly."
"This is the truth, and it has to be told, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Mr Sharon will not bring security and peace to his own people by re-occupying Palestinian towns, setting up yet more colonies, starving the population and destroying everything that can keep the hope of a State alive, particularly the hope of Palestinian Authority, and this is something being pointed out by many dignified and courageous people in Israel itself."
"What credibility can the Elsinore peace plan that you mentioned have, if you gloss over the root causes of the Middle East tragedy?"
"What sort of tragedy might this reckless headlong pursuit of the strategy of force lead to, if all those who have some authority do not use all their influence to stop Ariel Sharon?"
"You did not even demand an end to the siege of President Arafat or the withdrawal of Israeli forces."
"Does it not bother you that your position is a considerable distance from Commissioner Patten's, for example?"
"Europe must live up to the world's expectations of it."
"Today, you unfortunately fell far short of them."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, in addition to what we have been saying over and over again for some time now, I would like to make two comments."
"Regarding the Middle East, we are in a global situation in which there has just been a new development, which is not yet reflected in either the Brok or Titley Report."
"The US Administration is putting forward a new strategy for re-organising the world."
"As part of this new strategy, the US Administration is telling us that there are situations in which we must intervene and take preventative action."
"This is its first argument."
"Its second argument is if the United Nations supports this action, all well and good; if it is against this action, it does not matter, we shall take action with the support of our friends."
"I urge the European Union to draft a memorandum in response to this new situation."
"I do not want the response from Mr Schröder, from Mr Blair or Mr Chirac, or from Mr Anyone."
"I want a response from Europe regarding a situation which completely changes the last 50 years of history."
"Over the last 50 years, we have attempted to put in place a global justice system and global rules by means of global institutions such as the UN."
"It is clear that, in a region such as the Middle East, there are two states, two entities that do not respect the decisions of the UN."
"Israel does not respect the decisions of the UN, it is true, but there are those within the Palestinian Movement who do not respect them either."
"I therefore fully agree with the condemnation of Israel, of the Israeli policy, but I do not agree with the way the Palestinians condemn the attacks, which is purely verbal."
"This is one of the problems: we are faced with two sides who do not respect what the United Nations or the political forces decide."
"Yet the two nations concerned need political forces which respect what global law asks of them."
"Both sides need political leaders which respects what is asked."
"That is why I believe that we in Europe - unlike the US - shall only make progress in the Middle East if we show the same empathy, the same sympathy for the Israelis as we show the Palestinians, only if we feel the same way for the Israelis as we do the Palestinians."
"If someone, a political force, decides to support one side rather than the other, we shall have lost, because it will be impossible to go forward."
"This is why the role of the European Union is so important."
"The Union is the only political entity which is capable today of making each side see reason and of helping, at the same time, both the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"It is this policy that Europe must pursue; but above all, Europe must condemn Ariel Sharon when he blockades Yasser Arafat and condemn the Palestinians when they hide behind terrorists."
"Mr President, for a period of six weeks there was a form of peace in the Middle East and our attention turned to Iraq."
"That peace has been shattered by renewed acts of terror intended to wreck the peace process."
"Once again suicide bombers attacked in Israel."
"More families have been bereaved and more victims have been added to the tragic pages of the Middle East conflict."
"Then came the deployment of Israeli tanks in Ramallah and in the north of the Gaza Strip."
"Palestinian children were targeted in their schoolyard in Hebron."
"Both sides must show their commitment to peace by acting with maximum restraint, as called for by the EU Presidency in its recent declaration."
"Force cannot defeat force, but peace can be built on peace."
"The siege of the Palestinian Presidency compound is counterproductive."
"Restricting the freedom of movement of the Palestinian leadership does not contribute to fighting terror."
"It is hard to see how it will lead to a reform of the Palestinian Authority."
"For far too long the Palestinian people have been denied their legitimate rights."
"Their ability to survive is constantly undermined."
"They are stalked by poverty."
"Without jobs and essential services they are forced to live in appalling conditions."
"The people of Israel also live in a situation of insecurity."
"Attack and counter-attack are leading nowhere."
"The parties must move forward."
"The security issues must be addressed, but not at the expense of the economic and humanitarian needs of the Palestinians."
"The European Union is committed to working closely with the UN, the US and Russia in seeking ways to encourage and assist the parties involved to end the conflict and move towards a permanent peace."
"The conflict must end."
"The way to move forward is through cooperation and dialogue, and permanent peace must be established."
"This must be our resolve."
"The longer the conflict continues, the more it becomes a source of regional instability."
"Mr President, what is reprehensible in the Brok Report - as we have already said, but it is increasingly clear - and, generally speaking, in the CFSP's approach, is this belief, which could be described as surreal, that the EU Member States are automatically associated due to Europe's natural general interest in the world, so that all we need to do is conjure up a pre-existing and straightforward foreign policy that is familiar to the initiated at the very least, to enable the European Union to become, quite naturally, a major player on the world stage."
"This belief is put forward, in the report that is, with the call for the communitarisation of the CFSP, which was also quite rightly criticised last August by the French President, but which constantly comes back to and which is based on this - I repeat, surreal - idea, of the pre-existence of an interest and, therefore, of a common foreign policy."
"Yet, reality, from one crisis to the next, continually challenges this belief."
"The crises in the Balkans, firstly in Bosnia and then, more recently, in Kosovo, in the meantime, the crises in the Great Lakes region, the various phases of the crises in the Middle East, have shown us that the European Union has never ever succeeded in taking an initiative and in playing a role other than that of the stooge, of the United States, obviously."
"We can only respond to the initiatives taken by others, on other sides of the Atlantic, and, the worst thing, which is, in a way, the most delightful thing for those who know what Europe is really made of, namely of independent nations, is that in several crises, particularly in the current crisis in Iraq, there are - poor old Europe, it is still in disarray - stark differences between London and Berlin, and Paris as well, and these are, to a certain extent, patently obvious."
"Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should perhaps reflect sooner or later on the very way the CFSP is put into practice, because we are verging on a degree of absurdity, by constantly repeating that we will do better next time and that, from one report to the next, we will be able to define a common foreign policy."
"This is still a figment of our imagination and will remain so."
"I think that, sooner or later, we should reflect on just how possible this common foreign policy actually is."
"Mr President, looking at the dramatic way the current geopolitical situation has become more acute since 11 September last, there is much to be said for Europe having a Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"It will not, however, be an easy matter."
"When the USA - at a time when Bill Clinton was still President - and England bombed Baghdad shortly before Christmas 1999 without a UN mandate, I wrote a comment piece in an Austrian newspaper, Der Standard, the key point in which was that this bombardment, denounced by France, Italy, and Russia, and which drew a sharp protest note from the Vatican, had resulted in a fine crack running across Europe."
"Today, I leave it to you to judge whether this chasm has widened or become narrower in the meantime."
"I would also ask you to consider whether substantial European interests would be affected by an attack on Iraq or even on Iran, which is sought by certain hawks in the US administration who aim to topple the regimes in Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt as well."
"It is in any case to be welcomed that the EU's Foreign Ministers, at the informal Council meeting in Elsinore expressed their opposition to military intervention in Iraq."
"This awakens hope that the current geopolitical tendency, led by the USA, of resorting to force rather than having recourse to international law, will not be endorsed in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that both the European Union's history and its contemporary outlook provide great proof of its capacity for peacemaking, in the form of the development and enlargement of the European Union itself."
"It is an area of stability, democracy and prosperity, which will be extended by the enlargement of the European Union."
"I consider this a crucial justification for a specifically European policy of making further progress in these areas."
"We have to use it to build bridges to those parts of our continent that even now are not able or due to join the European Union, as well as with those who do not want to."
"Relations with Russia are, for example, made crucially important by the enlargement of the European Union; a positive interaction must come into being, and we must not set up new boundaries, but rather these boundaries must be turned into bridges."
"Commissioner Patten, what the Commission has now proposed in connection with Kaliningrad strikes me as a step in the right direction when it comes to finding a starting point that takes into account small countries' interests, their sensitivities and their claims to sovereignty, and also enables them to implement Schengen whilst at the same time accepting that Russia has a certain interest in the matter."
"I hope that these negotiations lead to a constructive result that incorporates both points of view."
"I know that the Danish Council Presidency has a particular interest in this issue."
"The European Union is also on the right track in other areas, for example in the Barcelona process."
"We are proud that we are able to say that we spend three times as much of our budget on preventive action in the area of external policy than does the United States of America."
"We should also have something to say about the positive elements."
"But - and this is the big 'but' - Europe still lacks a voice when it comes to the real issues of war and peace."
"The significance of what has happened over recent weeks in connection with Iraq, whether it be the uncritical tagging along behind Washington, whether it be an uncritical rejection of its demands for electoral reasons, is that there is no common European position."
"Yet it is only together that we can exert the pressure that is needed to keep the dictator's hands away from weapons of mass destruction, and, on the other hand, to be able to enforce a process of consultation with the United States of America, one that will give consideration not only to the risks of a military intervention but also to all the options for a peaceful solution to the problem of how to eliminate the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein has in his possession, and does so in tandem with the United Nations."
"In neither of these directions have we demonstrated our capacity to give our citizens security, and we have known since 11 September that security is no longer clearly bounded by certain frontiers, but that it is also possible for a mere handful of terrorists to be operating with dangerous weapons in the midst of our own countries and to be capable of killing people in their thousands."
"This has to do with the fact that most people in our Member States have not yet grasped that the small size and weakness of our Member States means that national interests can only be safeguarded if we pool our capacities."
"What is needed is for us to really grasp that and also get it through to our citizens - or rather, it is the citizens that will get it across to the governments, as 70% of the public in the European Union favour a European Security and Defence Policy!"
"Only in the foreign ministries of our countries is that not yet understood!"
"It also ties in with military capabilities."
"That the 60 000-strong rapid reaction force will be set up on paper by next year, is something of which I am certain, but will it be at all effective, being blind and lame for lack of any logistics capability or satellite facilities?"
"Is it truly operational and capable of making a contribution to a secure peace?"
"Are we in a position to devise an arms policy that will make us independent and give us the technological capabilities that are also of great importance for competitiveness in non-military spheres?"
"Mr Titley's report will go into this in greater depth."
"Have we sorted out the problems we had with Operation Amber Fox and Macedonia?"
"Do we have rules to prevent the European Union and Turkey from being at loggerheads?"
"All this shows that national posturing and egoism have prevented us from making really decisive progress in matters of war and peace."
"I do believe that much of the good that was said in the aftermath of 11 September is now forgotten and was locked away in governments' desk drawers not long after it saw the light of day."
"Let us take, for example, the issue of external and internal security."
"Let us just retrieve the great speeches our Heads of State or Government delivered after 11 September, and let us see how much was put into practice."
"If we do, we will see this for the low point that it is."
"I believe that our projects will only succeed insofar as we fashion a vessel in which a common European will can develop in the area of foreign, security and defence policy."
"That is what makes the Convention so very important."
"We have to bring about a reform of the institutions, one in which Europe speaks with one voice, with a voice, moreover, that is subject to Parliamentary control, and whose Budget is subject to Parliamentary control, in other words, with a voice originating from the Commission, although any such external affairs commissioner should of course be legitimised by having a special link with the Council."
"The creation of dual structures, which is currently being talked up so much, has, however, nothing to do with the people involved at the top, who do outstanding work. It costs money, and 80% of its energy is expended on infighting instead of being used to develop European positions in external affairs."
"That is only human nature, but I do think it is something we should overcome."
"We are shortly to have twenty-five Member States, and then that really will not work any more!"
"What this shows is that, when it comes to these issues, the European Union must at last come to realise where its interests lie."
"I believe that the public have moved on from what we are doing politically, and so we in this Parliament should pursue this campaign rigorously."
"It is the governments of the Member States that are enfeebling Europe, while we should be restoring her strength!"
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking Commissioner Patten for his kind words earlier on."
"When we are discussing the Code of Conduct, I think we have to set it in a very clear context."
"We should begin by recognising that the Code of Conduct is the most comprehensive international arms export control regime in existence."
"Nowhere else is there such a sharing of information about arms transfers."
"We must also recognise just how far we have come."
"We were told at one time that a Code of Conduct was not possible."
"Then, that if we had it, it would be no more than a statement of intention."
"Then, that any annual report would not be published."
"And then that the Parliament would never be consulted on such an annual report."
"All these things have come to pass, and we see that the Code, in operation, has developed its own in-built dynamics."
"So, it is actually taking Member States further than they initially wanted to go when they started off rather suspiciously with a Code of Conduct."
"We should recognise that and set all our criticisms in that context."
"The application of the Code is leading Member States towards greater dialogue, mutual understanding and greater convergence."
"What is fascinating for me is that the annual reports show that we are making progress on the very issues which the European Parliament has raised."
"We have often called for action to be taken on arms brokering, and we believe that it has been a fundamental weakness of the Code of Conduct that it has not addressed this issue."
"Therefore, we are very pleased that the third Annual Report states that guidelines for controlling arms brokers have been agreed in Council, that Member States should be looking to register arms brokers, and that these legal controls should be supported by penalties."
"We welcome that."
"However, the report does not say when this is all going to happen."
"We need a timetable for progress, so that all Member States take action in relation to arms brokers."
"We have called for greater transparency, both at national and European level, we recognise that some of the problem of lack of transparency is created by different Member States collecting information in different ways."
"We welcome, therefore, the improvements in the third Annual Report, but we are still having problems in relation to data collection and reporting."
"We look to the Danish Presidency, given its Nordic enthusiasm for transparency, to make progress in this area, during its time in office."
"At a national level, we welcome the fact that the third Annual Report has set out a matrix, seeking to note where information converges and where it does not."
"We would hope that that information is not used to reduce the information to the lowest common denominator; we should be working on best practice in this field."
"Under the Code of Conduct, Member States who grant a licence for an essentially identical transaction previously denied by another Member State should consult that Member State."
"We have never been clear about what 'identical transaction' means, so we welcome the third Annual Report's statement that 'there will be a broad interpretation of that phrase' - but we are still not clear what it means."
"Until we are clear what it means, there will be considerable uncertainty about the 'no undercutting' clause."
"I think we should be asking whether these transactions have an identical consequence."
"If that is the case, then they are an identical transaction; and we would be intrigued to know if consultation did in fact take place on the recent saga over Belgian exports to Nepal."
"We have asked in any case that these discussions should not be bilateral but multilateral."
"Therefore, we welcome indications that there will be multilateral discussions in cases where there is no agreement about whether a licence should be given."
"We would hope that will be expanded, although we recognise the difficulties it presents."
"We have also asked for greater efforts to be made on end-user certification, so we welcome the fact that the COARM working party is working towards this."
"We would like to see a Europe-wide database established in order to assist smaller countries, who find end-user certification and follow-up particularly onerous."
"We have also asked for action to be taken on licensed production abroad; and here again we welcome the fact that there is progress on this in the third Annual Report."
"What we would like to see, however, is clarification on the terms of the Code of Conduct with regard to the export of arms into areas of instability."
"To what extent - particularly given areas of obvious instability, such as India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or the situation in the Middle East - are Member States interpreting that?"
"Finally, I would say that the third Annual Report is a huge step forward, but on closer inspection, much of it is about words and intentions rather than actions."
"My conclusion is this: we have come a long way, a lot has been done, but a lot more still needs to be done."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it was possible, at the Helsinki Summit, to get the impression that we really were on the way to having a common European defence policy."
"The Heads of State or Government of the time set themselves ambitious objectives, and the early months made it possible to assume that these objectives would be achieved relatively speedily and within the time limits envisaged."
"Looking at matters today, when the deadline is fast approaching, we can see that we are far from achieving these objectives."
"The current proposal that NATO should deploy and build up a crisis intervention force makes it clear that our American friends have also lost confidence that we Europeans can actually reach the decisions that are required."
"This should prompt us to make new attempts along these lines, as this European crisis intervention force is, as I see it, an essential step towards securing peace around the European Union."
"Turning now to the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, I would like to thank Mr Titley for his excellent report."
"We have common rules on arms exports, we have a common code and a code of conduct, but these rules are interpreted in different ways."
"We have just seen an export to one Member State prohibited, whilst the same goods were then allowed to be exported to another."
"This must not be allowed to happen in future; whilst we need common rules, the way in which they are applied must also be common to all."
"It will probably turn out that any code of conduct will be insufficient, and these rules will also have to be put on a legal footing."
"When talking about arms exports, we are on the way to a common market in the defence field as well."
"That is why I consider it important, if we are talking about shipping armaments within the European Union and the export rules unfortunately cease to be applied, for these shipments to be made easier."
"All 15 EU countries, after all, form a community of values composed of democratic states, and this leads me to believe that such a thing is possible, as are substantial savings, estimated by experts at EUR 240 billion per annum."
"I would like to conclude by pointing out how important democratic control is in this area."
"I would therefore like there to be even greater attention paid to this debate."
"If not only foreign policy, but also defence policy, are under discussion, then the matter at issue is war and peace, about which democratically elected parliaments alone can decide."
"At present, this burden rests primarily on the shoulders of our counterparts in the national parliaments, but, the more this European policy develops, the more this Parliament will also have to take upon itself this crucial task."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to be frank, I believe Mr Sharon only wants military, not political options."
"He has once again used disproportionate force."
"It is true that the Palestinian suicide attacks are despicable - we all know that - but what did Mr Sharon do during the periods in which there were no attacks?"
"Let us remember his requirement in June 2001 that seven days should pass without violence before he would make any political concessions."
"In December 2001, there were three weeks of peace; in 2002, six weeks."
"Did Mr Sharon make the slightest political gesture?"
"No, but during those six weeks of peace the Tsahal killed dozens of Palestinians."
"I ask the Council, here and now, is this not a bad sign?"
"Mr Sharon carried out military attacks at key moments with the intention of invalidating periods in which there were no suicide attacks."
"The last time, when all the Palestinian groups, under pressure from Mr Arafat, were considering the possibility of putting an end to suicide attacks against civilians in Israel, Mr Sharon's political response was to bomb an entire building in the Gaza strip, killing dozens of people, including eleven children."
"Mr Sharon - let us be clear about this - has never made, nor will he ever make, any political concessions, except those imposed upon him, because he is not interested in peace."
"Mr Sharon is interested in pacification, humiliation, the capitulation of the Palestinians, but not in a genuine, fair peace."
"The situation, Mr President, is extremely serious with regard to Mr Arafat's physical safety, the Palestine identity, which has been crushed by Israel - and more specifically by Mr Sharon - and the area, because Mr Sharon will continue on the warpath until there is an invasion of Iraq, unilaterally decided on by the United States, at which point Mr Sharon will take advantage of the situation to definitively destroy any remaining fragment of the Oslo process, of the 'peace of the brave'."
"Will the EU continue to limit itself to expressing its deep concern over what is going on?"
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, the Brok Report discusses the progress made within the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"There has certainly been progress, but there remains much to be done, exactly as the rapporteur states."
"Foreign policy is one of the most important areas in which we really need strong European cooperation."
"Only through consistent action and a unanimous voice can the EU play a role in the international arena."
"For us Liberals, it is important that foreign policy be based on a clear strategy, characterised by the defence of democracy and human rights, respect for international conventions, free trade, conflict management and cooperation with other nations and organisations."
"We must be clear in our demands and values."
"If the famous human rights clause is to have any credibility, it is important to find tools that enable it to be applied."
"If we do not activate the human rights clause, despite the dreadful attacks made against human rights in the countries we are in partnership with, the clause will only arouse derision."
"For us Liberals, scrutiny of foreign policy is also important."
"Elected representatives and the public must be able as far as possible to follow and control what happens."
"Of course there are exceptions, but my group is not completely happy with the agreement that has been reached with regard to access to foreign documents."
"There are many good things to say about Mr Brok's report."
"My group also fully supports Mr Titley's report."
"Allow me to say in conclusion that we certainly disagree with the US administration on many points, and we have often criticised it in this Chamber."
"The anti-Americanism that sometimes emanates from here does, however, ring somewhat hollow when it is used solely as an excuse for concealing our own failure to produce a clear, common policy on matters such as Iraq and the Middle East issue."
"I have been talking to some of the Members, and they said: 'We do not agree with Bush but, if we had to choose between Saddam Hussein and George Bush, we would choose George Bush'."
"I, however, believe that there is a middle way between killing and dying, which we must take."
"I am not making a philosophical statement: this must be our political strategy, a strategy of living."
"However, in reality, George Bush's decision to use war as a deterrent takes us back to the Pax Romana: they called it peace and turned it into a desert."
"After 1945, we Europeans said 'No more war, ever'."
"This is the strategy we must pursue, a strategy of dignity, for our dignity is also diminished by dishonesty such as that we are currently displaying."
"Of course, Saddam Hussein must be made to change, but his people must change too."
"We must promote democracy in Iraq, we must ensure that the UN resolutions are complied with, but we also have to ensure compliance with the UN resolutions by Israel as well as by Saddam Hussein, and Israel has failed to comply with hundreds of declarations and resolutions."
"Commissioner Patten asked when death and suffering for Palestinians and Israelis will come to an end."
"Yes, when will it end?"
"I believe it will not end until we stop producing statements like those made by the President-in-Office of the Council today."
"As long as we continue along this path, Palestinians and Israelis will endure death and suffering for, as everyone is aware, Ariel Sharon's policy is a criminal policy which is destroying both his own and the Palestinian people."
"Yet it is not just the violence and cruelty which concern me, it is the political decision to colonise a country."
"Indeed, in recent days, while all our eyes have been fixed on the siege of the Muqata, Ariel Sharon has been appropriating land at Rafah and, at Kalandria, the airport has been reopened as an Israeli airport."
"What we are witnessing here is a colonial war."
"It is my genuine belief that, in the interests of peace, it is essential that we follow the example of the Israelis and Palestinians who are stating clearly that it is military occupation that is responsible for the situation."
"On no account can we continue as we have been doing."
"I am truly appalled and saddened, for we are all, myself included, responsible for what is happening in the Middle East and for the continuing deaths in the region."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, since the last debate on the situation in the Middle East, which took place in this House in May, the political horizon has become more than disheartening."
"Less than an hour's flight away from my native Sicily, the tragedy of two peoples with which we share friendship, history, culture and trade is continuing along its inexorable course."
"President Arafat is still enclosed in his headquarters, which have been reduced to a miserable cement hut, deprived of freedom of movement."
"Islamic terrorists continue to stain the cities of Israel with blood, striking at the civilian people without discrimination."
"We all agree in Europe on the need to create two free, sovereign states, and we all agree that this is the only way to restore peace in the Holy Land."
"How much credibility can Europe claim, though?"
"My countrymen ask me: 'How much credibility can you expect to have, as Members of the European Parliament, how can you expect us to become genuine supporters of Europe if Europe continues to sit still, defenceless, in the face of genocide which is taking place only a few miles away from us?"
"How can you fail to convene a major international conference involving the European Union, the United States, Russia and the United Nations, as called for by the High Representative for CFSP, to discuss the Palestinian question and the creation of two States?'"
"If economic measures are not matched by political, diplomatic action, the European Union will not succeed in freeing the two peoples from the tyranny of hatred."
"We must ensure that the European Union both embodies and is seen to embody genuine practical action, unity and accord."
"Mr President, the Council and Commission statements on the Middle East have made a significant contribution to the road map to peace that was drawn up by the European Union and adopted by our partners, the United States, Russia and the UN."
"We think that the progress made thus far to bring about the coexistence of two States should have aroused greater interest, but we fear that this plan will not be applied any better than previous ones, because it lacks a specific point of departure."
"In order to get the process off the ground, so that the Israeli army withdraws from the occupied territories, we also need the suicide attacks, which bring the whole process to a standstill, to stop once and for all."
"Not only do the attacks continue, but the Palestinian Authority also fails to condemn the terrorists convincingly, although they are not obviously protected."
"We therefore call for a policy based on good sense, whose starting point is a - genuine - end to the half-measures currently taken against terrorists."
"We call for an outright condemnation of Hamas and the Islamic Jihad, and for appropriate measures."
"And we also call for the Palestinian Authority to be reformed and to accept more responsibility, failing which, Mr President, it will be impossible for the essential dialogue to be resumed."
"Mr President, representatives of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join previous speakers in expressing my concern over the physical and moral siege that the leader of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, is currently experiencing."
"It is clear that this policy does not contribute either to reducing terrorist activity - but rather, on the contrary, stimulates and increases it - or to democratising the Palestinian National Authority, which had been planning legislative and presidential elections for January next year, nor does it contribute to finding safety valves to put an end to the damaging situation that this region is currently experiencing."
"Mr President, I believe we must ask the President-in-Office of the Council to request, clearly and convincingly, a resolution to this situation."
"This resolution must necessarily involve the lifting of the siege of the President of the Palestinian National Authority and compliance with the United Nations resolutions."
"The European Union, Mr President, must demand, clearly and convincingly, that the United Nations resolutions be complied with."
"Mr President, a truce allowing the Palestinian National Authority to control terrorist activity is also essential."
"It is ludicrous to say that the President of the Palestinian National Authority should control Palestinian terrorist activity when at the moment he is fighting just to survive."
"I also consider it absolutely essential to establish a series of measures aimed at ending Israeli military oppression, which is causing countless casualties, most of whom are civilians."
"It is clear, Mr President, that only on the basis of these premises will the initiatives of the Quartet, a peace conference for the region and the European Union's desire for peace, understanding, concord and reconciliation prevail in the region."
"Mr President, in no way do I wish to contradict the excellent reports by Mr Brok and Mr Titley which I support, in the same way as I support the comments that they have made."
"These reports quite rightly emphasise the progress made since last year in the area of the CFSP and in that of the ESDP. We have made progress, for example, by establishing the ESDP bodies, in the fight against terrorism and conflict prevention."
"I am thinking of the Balkans and of how specific crises have been managed."
"Alongside this progress, however, it must be noted that things have not been going too well just lately."
"Europe's voice often cannot be heard."
"Several speakers have told you this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Here are some examples: the European Union played no part in the military action in Afghanistan, although the Member States participated."
"In civilian matters, the Union once again provided substantial humanitarian and material aid, but its political role remained very low-key."
"In Iraq, in response to US intentions, the Union did, to its credit, reiterate the role that the United Nations should play."
"But what can the High Representative do, when confronted with the conflicting positions of the members of the Council of Ministers?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what are you, personally, doing today, on behalf of the European Union?"
"You have proposed absolutely nothing!"
"And what has our wonderful Mediterranean policy achieved, not only in the Middle East, but in Maghreb and the Mashreq countries?"
"The European Parliament is not the place where we will answer the question 'what can be done?'"
"To sum up, I would simply like to make one comment: the CFSP and the ESDP are intergovernmental policies."
"Once again, this method is showing its limitations."
"If our governments continue to disagree or choose silence or inaction, if, therefore, the Union has no genuine foreign policy or any genuine security policy, then we must change method and perhaps use the Community method instead."
"The answer lies primarily in the hands of the ministers."
"But as you said, Commissioner, nothing is a substitute for political will."
"I should, above all, like to congratulate Mr Titley, because just as the 1998 EU code was an important step towards more coherent and transparent European policy, so do the successive Titley Reports form a constructive and important contribution of this Parliament to reach a binding European code of conduct."
"The need for this code became apparent recently in my country, Belgium, where a minister resigned over an arms delivery to Nepal."
"Incidentally, I should like to note my regret at the fact that a number of Green MEPs have seized on this report for internal political purposes and I am surprised, Mr Staes, at their tabling amendments in which they condemn a decision made by the Belgian Government, while their Green colleagues endorsed this very decision in government."
"However, far more fundamental is that the Belgian Government has announced its willingness to include the provisions of the Code of Conduct in national legislation, as a result of which this code will become legally binding."
"I hope that other Member States will follow this example."
"In this way, we can prevent arms orders refused by one country from being accepted by another country."
"Moreover, Mr Titley is right in quoting existing Belgian law on arms trading as an example."
"This law indeed provides for tough sanctions on those who trade in weapons without a licence."
"The problem, however, does not only lie in the country of origin."
"It becomes a serious issue when the arms reach their final destination."
"A well-known Brussels research centre announced this week that half of all weapons transactions fail to meet the legal obligation of the arrival certificate."
"Consequently, there is an urgent need for an effective inspection system to monitor final destinations."
"It is of crucial importance to know in whose hands the weapons eventually end up."
"Otherwise, the European Code of Conduct, no matter how well intended, is completely futile."
"Mr President, I would also like to wish Mr Titley luck with his report and I would like to add my support for it and for what Mr Titley said in his presentation on further work in this area."
"However, I have a number of problems with Mr Brok's report."
"In my opinion it contains a fantastic amount of useful and important things, but the emphasis is wrong."
"Far too much weight has been placed on military security policy, while civil and economic security policy is left in the shadows."
"I consider that to be getting your priorities wrong, because in fact it is precisely this area in which the EU has a unique opportunity and some unique resources."
"You could say that the arena is now entirely open for us in this area."
"The USA is unilaterally prioritising military security policy."
"It is our strength to move into this field."
"We must use our trade agreements, our many contacts, etc. in the fight for peace, human rights and democracy."
"Unfortunately my own country has helped to prevent some of these opportunities, for example by not wishing to be part of renegotiating the Association Agreement with Israel."
"It is the Association Agreement that Israel is violating time after time."
"Finally, with regard to Iraq: what is the evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction?"
"I have now studied the flood of reports that have come in."
"I have read them in detail."
"The most powerful intelligence services in the world have worked towards this as their sole aim."
"There is not a shred of evidence."
"Why is that?"
"Mr President, I should like to speak on the Brok Report, which, as the previous speaker said, contains many valid points, but also a number of very complex issues, two of which I should like to single out."
"The first point relates to paragraph 20 in Mr Brok's resolution, which states that if the EU wishes to be credible, a further effort in the defence budget of certain Member States will be needed."
"This represents a serious misconception and analytical error."
"Total expenditure of all EU countries in the area of defence and security amounts to 50% of that of the United States."
"The options created as a result only amount to 10%."
"This means that it is of vital importance for cooperation and efficiency to be improved."
"In other words, the EU can do a lot more with the same money."
"This is why my group is completely convinced that an increase in defence expenditure is unnecessary, completely unfeasible in financial terms and wholly undesirable from a political perspective."
"The second point concerns the remark by Mr Yiannitsis, chairman of the Council for security, not, of course, to be confused with the Security Council."
"Unfortunately, you have had to repeat here what many of your predecessors have said before you, namely that no compromise has as yet been reached on the EU's use of NATO funds."
"This can only mean one of three things: either Greece is still being obstructive, and Turkey is outdoing it in obstructiveness, or they are both still being obstructive."
"I beg you, Mr Yiannitsis, spare us all a disappointment in this respect."
"The need for joint EU action has never been so great and, as you said yourself, support among the people has never been so great."
"I urge you to excel yourself for once."
"Show us that Greece, and this also goes for Turkey, is not a prisoner of the past."
"You, Greece, can do the EU a great service, but you can also do it a disservice."
"The choice is yours."
"Mr President, on the Brok report, I remain sceptical of the need to formally institute a CFSP or an ESDP."
"I prefer to retain a national foreign policy and work through NATO."
"Recent events over Iraq have questioned the viability of the CFSP."
"Nevertheless, I engage constructively with the EU reality, and I recognise the positive role Javier Solana has played, through the Quartet in the Middle East, in promoting long-term peace between Israel and Palestine."
"I also particularly support the role of Russia as our strategic partner."
"Nevertheless, I support the High Representative's role as an intergovernmental envoy and do not want these vital areas made Community-based."
"Furthermore, I support US aims to rid the world of the danger posed by Saddam Hussein."
"I was responsible for the amendment raising the serious issue of organised crime in the Balkans."
"A great advantage of EU enlargement in the long run is the inclusion of a country such as, for example, Ukraine, whose aspirations to join the EU the Commission is, sadly, ignoring."
"Enlargement will bind these countries to the West, encourage economic prosperity and make a much more coordinated fight against crime and illegal immigration possible when organisations such as Europol have a formal mandate."
"Another of my interests is India, which is clearly amongst several potential great powers that are in the midst of internal transition."
"With economic liberalisation, India offers a growing market for EU businesses."
"A multicultural secular democracy in an otherwise troubled region, it is a source of stability with a no-first-use nuclear policy."
"It is a bulwark against the rise of extremism, in particular regional Islamist tendencies such as those evidenced by recent attacks on Christian and western targets in Pakistan."
"These demonstrate an unchecked rise of religious fanaticism in that country, despite President Musharraf's rhetoric."
"Tragically, only yesterday 34 Hindus were killed by an Islamic terrorist bomb attack on a Hindu temple in Gujarat."
"I do not share all the Brok report's objectives, but I remain an interested observer of this revolutionary change from the city state of some 2 000 years ago, to the 19th-century nation-state, and to the EU Member State that we are witnessing today."
"Mr President, historians will without doubt say that Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's 'no' to war was the stimulus for a genuine European foreign policy."
"Mr Schröder had the courage to say clearly and directly to President Bush what the vast majority of citizens is thinking."
"His 'no' marks Europe's emancipation from the Pentagon's imperialist tendencies."
"This preventative and solitary war would have been unjust, because, without the authorisation of the United Nations Security Council, it would have caused political difficulties and severe economic setbacks in Europe, it would have alienated the Arab world, it would not have been in the interest of Israel either, as this war would have converted Israel into a fortress perpetually under siege."
"The most affected, however, would have been the Palestinian people, who are today surrounded, trapped and starving in their vast open-air prison."
"According to the findings of the Luxembourg Committee for a Just Peace in the Middle East, this war would have exposed the Palestinians to serious dangers."
"The best case scenario would have been an acute increase in repression; the worst case scenario, which would fulfil Mr Sharon's ambitions, would be the wholesale movement of populations, the colonisation of the occupied territories and the straightforward annexation of these people by Israel."
"The preparations for repression were already so far advanced that Mr Sharon sent in the bulldozers, even in the absence of an attack on Iraq."
"All that the world had to do would have been to turn a blind eye."
"Mr President, in a few months, the UN inspectors will tell us whether Iraq really does have military weaponry."
"There will still be time then, and I am speaking to you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to implement, in its entirety, Security Council Resolution 687(91) which emphasises that the disarmament of Iraq is part of an initiative whose goal is to establish in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles."
"The new world order, proclaimed after the Gulf War by President Bush Snr, has quickly been forgotten."
"Mr President, I would like to devote my intervention to Mr Titley's very fine report."
"Stopping the supply of weapons and the granting of licences is well known to be among the most effective methods of preventing conflict, and this is, incidentally, true also of the Middle East."
"Many things are actually less surprising when one looks at the figures that show how much was supplied to the Middle East last year."
"Although the bringing of conflict prevention to the fore is part of the European Union's purpose - for it is cheaper than ending military conflicts later on - people are still cheerfully exporting to conflict regions."
"The Belgians are supplying firearms to Nepal, where civil war is raging, Great Britain's supply of radar screens for fighter aircraft contravenes Criterion 3 of the Code, while Sweden, France, and Great Britain are contravening its Operative Provision 4 by supplying heavy munitions to India without facing the consequences."
"It is precisely in this area that the Code is weak, as it is not binding and makes no provision for sanctions against those who supply weapons to conflict regions all the same."
"It must not surprise us if taxpayers complain that this European Union of ours gives out, on the one hand, development aid to these countries, which, on the other, are then destroyed by their own munitions."
"It is for this reason that the Code of Conduct has to be applied in such a way as to really stop the supply of weapons to crisis regions."
"That must be our objective!"
"Mr President, the aim of policy regarding Iraq is not to avoid war at any price and it is not merely to see the return of weapons inspectors."
"It is to bring about the disarmament of Saddam Hussein's regime so that he is no longer a threat to us or indeed to his regional neighbours."
"We should have acted earlier."
"11 September has now given us a heightened sensitivity to potential threats."
"If we let Saddam carry on in the way that he is, then what message does this send to others of malign intent?"
"My criticism of the British Government is that it has left it far too late to fight the battle for public opinion and that its effort to build a coalition of political support among the Europeans has clearly been poor."
"The example of Iraq exposes yet again the frailty of common security policy in the European Union and not surprisingly it confirms a widely differing outlook in interests of the Member States of the European Union."
"Unlike Mr Poos, I do not see Mr Schröder as my spokesman."
"Some Members of this House have a reflex anti-Americanism."
"Instead, I had hoped that they would all be motivated by the need to enhance western security in a dangerous world."
"This requires strong and unassailable partnership with the United States."
"The Brok report reveals a different set of motives."
"It is all about empowering the European Union and boosting the role of the European Commission in particular."
"I disagree with this."
"It has nothing to do with enhancing the security of our citizens."
"Yesterday in Warsaw NATO Foreign Ministers welcomed proposals for a NATO military response force."
"20 000 troops will be used for short-term, high-intensity combat operations."
"This would complement other NATO reaction forces already in existence and be a real incentive for NATO allies other than just the Americans and British to provide a small number of highly-trained and well-equipped forces ready to take on urgent tasks on a global basis."
"The European countries should forget the distractions of the European rapid reaction force separate from NATO and concentrate instead on improving military capabilities for alliance operations."
"Mr President, a neutral onlooker recording the current crises would observe that there is tension surrounding Iraq and a second area of tension in the Middle East. He would also observe that, basically, European policy in both areas of tension is conspicuous by its absence."
"Does that mean we have no profile?"
"If we look at other areas of the world, we have a very high profile."
"However, they all have one thing in common."
"Where we have intervened in crises, we have not intervened either to create a crisis or to resolve it, we have intervened merely in order to manage it."
"Yet, in the Middle East, the only time when progress was made, in the agreement between Arafat and assassinated Prime Minister Rabin, the European Union was involved."
"So what does that prove?"
"That the third pillar of the European Union needs more work to build it up."
"It needs a stratagem defined in terms of a number of general principles on which we all agree."
"What are these general principles?"
"First, respect for the European political culture."
"Secondly, respect for international law."
"Thirdly, a balance in relations between the centres of power on the world map."
"Fourthly, a perception of the fact that a common defence and security policy requires certain minimum policies in other sectors."
"For example, I should like to ask the Commissioner, what happens next with Galileo?"
"What happens next with the European Union's famous common aircraft carrier, despite the fact that it is nothing to do with the European Union?"
"Having said which, I think that important progress has been made but that more needs to be done, because a Common Foreign and Security Policy forms an integral part of economic development and peace and every other kind of development."
"I think that the Brok Report provides a fairly relaxed framework for a military perception and we shall slowly have to set it on a firmer basis, with a clear direction and with the objective of international peace, security and cooperation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I am disappointed about the fact that the new Liberal, Mr Johan Van Hecke, is still getting up to his Christian-Democratic tricks."
"Following his pacific speech, I would ask him, during the vote, to be guided by his conscience rather than by the Flemish Liberal Democrat party whip."
"I fully endorse Mr Titley's remark about the absolute need for multilateral discussion once one Member State has refused a licence."
"In this respect, I would recommend approval of Amendments Nos 1 and 7, which make undercutting more difficult."
"It is said, with good reason, that the code of conduct must become absolutely binding."
"This is the gist of our Amendments Nos 2 and 8."
"Further to the Nepal crisis, the Belgian Government will at long last include the code of conduct in national legislation."
"Could I invite the other fourteen governments finally to follow this Belgian example?"
"Mr President, it used to be said that war is too serious a business to be left to generals."
"I fear that today defence is too serious a business to be left to politicians."
"It is my fear that in an understandable but misguided wish for the European Union to have its own defence capability, politicians are forging ahead with plans that are at best wishful thinking, and at worst dangerous."
"If the plan is to mirror the position of the EMU in relationship to the EU, then I foresee that the ESDP is going to inhibit NATO from functioning efficiently and properly."
"I have read Mr Brok's report, and while there is much in it - especially in the original draft - that I find interesting, I fear its proposals will create more problems than they solve."
"Let us be honest, Europe's armed forces have a woefully depleted capability."
"Europe's national governments have no coherence or agreement when it comes to military operations."
"None of the experience and sophistication that has been so painstakingly and carefully developed by NATO on both the political and operational fronts is apparent in any of these proposals."
"Without an increase in defence spending that would be unacceptable to our electors, Europe's armed forces cannot mount and maintain any major operation outside the immediate area."
"Nobody can deny that NATO's record is what we should be seeking to protect, not to undermine."
"It is time that Prime Minister Blair stopped dallying with other concepts."
"He should make it clear that Britain and the other European states that are NATO members have a future only within NATO."
"Defence policy is literally a matter of life and death: the death not of politicians, but of soldiers, sailors and airmen."
"They cannot be put at risk for the sake for closer European political integration."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Bureau informs us that it is adopting measures to stop the noise caused by the automatic start-up of a security system that cannot be switched off for a while."
"For the moment, then, we shall have to work in these poor conditions."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, rapporteurs, where its security and defence policy is concerned, Europe is definitely at a crossroads: either we allow ourselves to be forced, mainly by a few hardliners in the current US Government, into a course of action that would above all further deepen the crisis in the Middle East, or Europe has the courage and strength to break this vicious circle."
"We can, indeed we must, have grave doubts about whether the regime in Iraq, which is certainly abhorrent, should be eliminated by external military means."
"But both moral insight and political common sense mitigate strongly against intervening in Iraq for as long as Israel is not prepared to implement the United Nations resolutions and for as long as Israel is not prepared to allow the Palestinians to elect their political leadership freely and without external pressure."
"Recent events show particularly clearly that the current government - and it is not the country of Israel as such - is unwilling to do its bit to break the spiral of violence and stabilise the region."
"How much more reasonable and successful it would be surely to let our colleagues in the Palestinian Legislative Council get on with their legitimate political work."
"It seems that the Sharon Government actually does not want democratic decision-making structures and free elections in Palestine at all."
"The natural right of any government to defend itself against terrorism is often only used as a pretext."
"The Middle East is a region whose security affects our security in Europe."
"That is why Europe must defend itself against private terrorism, against unreasonable State military measures and unilateral, external interventions not backed by UN resolutions."
"Only in this way can the right to sovereignty and internal self-determination be realised."
"Following the general recognition of Israel, including by the Arab States, it is now time - decades after the founding of the State of Israel - for the second half of the UN resolution concerned to be implemented too, namely the creation of a Palestinian State."
"The best and most successful way of putting an end to terrorism - and this, Mr President-in-Office, should be stated loud and clear - is to recognise those natural rights that are the prerogative of every people and every nation, including the Palestinians."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Parliament for this debate."
"It has been interesting to listen to the many speeches and points of view."
"Weighing up the speeches as a whole, it is quite clear that we must see more progress in the CFSP and that we must have more in the way of a common foreign policy."
"I am pleased that those are also the conclusions drawn in Parliament's report and in Mr Brok's speech."
"I should like, however, to make the point that, in view of the fact that there are 15 countries for which foreign policy is of prime concern, we have really done rather well actually to have a common foreign policy in so many cases."
"The common foreign policy is in actual fact the rule rather than the exception."
"It will succeed only if we listen to each other and bring about a consensus, but that is something we are all united in aiming for."
"It is true that different foreign policy positions are expressed but, when we reach the point of taking the final decision on the common foreign policy, it is usual for us to do so jointly."
"That applies in the cases both of the Middle East and of Iraq."
"There is in fact consensus in these areas in spite of what is often a variety of public statements of our positions."
"Parliament is nonetheless clearly right about our having most influence when we stand together."
"If, moreover, divisions are created in the EU, there is also a loss of influence."
"Parliament is right about this."
"It should nonetheless be emphasised that the EU has in actual fact become one of the leading actors in the efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East."
"I have the impression that it has to some extent escaped Parliament's attention that it is the European peace plan that is being worked on at the moment."
"We have not in fact had such a plan before."
"We have had French and German peace plans, together with American and Arabic ones, but we have not had a European plan."
"Moreover, the European peace plan also led, of course, to working parties and task forces being set up in July, and these have in actual fact progressively advanced the process of reform in the Middle East."
"There has been money that, in spite of everything, has been restored to Palestine."
"There have been workers who, in spite of everything, have been given permission to leave Palestine and work in Israel."
"I acknowledge that my introductory speech was probably too optimistic, and I am sorry about that."
"I also said in my speech, however, that the optimism I had felt had been shattered by the events of last week."
"I regret moreover that I did not, then, express myself sufficiently clearly regarding the pessimism that is again on the point of getting the upper hand in the Middle East."
"We can therefore choose to be pessimists and not do anything at all."
"It is the easiest thing in the world to be a pessimist."
"That way, you always turn out to be right."
"We are obliged to work in a spirit of optimism. Otherwise, we could not stand to go on working."
"That is why we have devised the peace plan that was adopted by the Quartet and, as I mentioned the other day, is now also the Security Council's plan."
"Has the European Parliament experienced anything similar before in the Middle East?"
"I really do not think so."
"Moreover, it has been brought about by virtue of constructive cooperation with Russia, the UN and the United States, whereby we do not seek sources of conflict but try to find the solidarity that will carry us through."
"As Parliament quite rightly says on this subject - and this is something with which I agree, as does the whole of Europe and, indeed, the whole world - solidarity of this kind would consist in two states existing peacefully side by side, and it is a source of some astonishment that so much blood has to be shed in the region in order to achieve what we all know will be the final outcome. It cannot end in any other way."
"That is why we constantly make powerful appeals to both parties."
"We call upon the terrorists to cease their acts of terror and upon the Israeli army to halt its excessive use of force."
"That is the message we constantly convey."
"It is, moreover, the same message that Kofi Annan delivered to the UN General Assembly the other day, when he said that the peace process must be driven by hope and by deeds: deeds on the part of the Palestinians, aimed at genuinely halting the terrorism, and hope in the form of Israel's really making it clear that the outcome will be a Palestinian state."
"Otherwise, the terrorism will not successfully be brought to an end."
"European policy, or the Council of Minister's policy, is therefore quite clear and corresponds, then, to what is also global policy."
"I agree completely with Mr Cohn-Bendit that we must not forget the Palestinians' responsibility for combating terrorism and, as some MEPs have mentioned, we are putting pressure on both parties."
"I talked for an hour the other evening with Mr Sharon about the pointlessness of maintaining the present siege."
"He will not achieve his objectives in that way."
"This has been said quite clearly."
"Mr Arafat has also been told that he needs to guarantee that no terrorists enter Israel."
"The main topic's having after all been the Middle East, I want finally to say that the European position has also carried the day with regard to Iraq."
"The European common position is that we should comply with the Security Council."
"The European position is that the Security Council should be supported."
"That also means, then - and this is the common position we adopted in Elsinore - that we must listen to the Security Council and be willing to accommodate its requirements of us."
"There is no split in the European position as adopted by the Foreign Ministers."
"It is about complying with the Security Council."
"It is also a position that has paid off, because the United States has of course also agreed to comply with, and consult, the Security Council."
"Finally, I want to thank Mr Titley for his report on the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports."
"I endorse Mr Titley's concluding words to the effect that a lot has been done and that more needs to be done."
"With regard to the transparency that Mr Titley was kind enough to expect from the Danish Presidency, I should like to say that we shall be very pleased to accommodate that wish."
"The fourth annual report under the Danish Presidency will increase transparency by providing more statistical data and will add a compendium of adopted practices to show how the code is being implemented by the Member States."
"The report will also contain new agreements on transit, final user certificates and the production of military equipment under licence in third countries."
"That is how the Member States are obliged to regulate the arms trade."
"Several Member States have introduced the legislation, and others are preparing such legislation."
"On the basis of Mr Titley's report and the backing it has received from Parliament, I am able to say that Parliament's support for the Danish Presidency's efforts is very welcome and very valuable."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank you for the debate and the comments made, especially on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, from which numerous direct and indirect conclusions have emerged."
"I shall confine myself to two comments: first, on the question raised by Mr von Wogau, who highlighted an interesting shortcoming in Europe's defence and security policy, to do with the absence of a single market."
"We do in fact agree that this is an area in which cooperation, be it on the production side or be it on the research and development side, as well as more general cooperation between countries can bring in significant results."
"It is a shortcoming, as Mr Brok also notes in his report, which makes some very interesting points as regards security and defence, with which, as I said, we agree."
"We believe that Europe, which has made such a tremendous effort and has achieved results in research and development in the non-military sector of the economy, could extend this effort to the area of defence if it wishes to acquire greater autonomy, independence and development potential and derive economic benefit from it."
"My second comment has to do with the question raised by Mr Lagendijk."
"As the Presidency, I have outlined the efforts being made to resolve the problem."
"I should like to point out that the solution we need to aim for is a European foreign and security policy which is open to any third countries wishing to share this new experience with the European Union."
"However, we also need to safeguard certain principles: the principle of independence of the Union's decision-making system and the integrity of its institutions."
"These are principles which Parliament itself has called for and they are included in the Treaties, which is why we are working to make a success of them."
"I am positive that, with the systematic efforts being made and with the real spirit which can be demonstrated on all sides, we shall be able - I hope soon - to reach a result."
"Mr President, there are just a couple of points I would like to make."
"They are both points, certainly the first, on which I hope to say rather more over the coming months."
"The first point is that grumbling about the United States of America is not the same as having European foreign policy."
"Equally, assuming that any European initiative is wrong and that any scintilla of disagreement with the United States is somehow high treason does not strike me as being a very good basis for the protection of the national interests of any Member State of the European Union."
"I am always surprised that some of the most fierce protectors and protestors about national sovereignty seem to suppress that point of view as soon as Richard Pearl raises his voice."
"So in the distinguished and ever noble presence of my honourable friend and publisher, ever noble despite the constitutional machinations of New Labour, I commend, as ever, the middle way."
"But if we are to take the middle way of European multilateralism providing more weight on our end of the transatlantic rope, being able to act as a counterpart and occasionally as a counterweight, then we have as European politicians to face up to the political and financial consequences of that."
"I hope that we will increasingly be prepared to do so."
"There is a second point I should make in response to the honourable Member, Mr Barón Crespo."
"He asked for a report on destroyed EU financial projects."
"He will recall that we tried to provide the figures for Commission projects a few months ago."
"At present, we are trying to get information from Member States on all of their projects."
"It is not made easy by the situation on the ground."
"As soon as we have that information in as accurate a form as possible, we will of course share it with the honourable Member and the whole House."
"It is an important point and it should be possible to arrive at a figure."
"However, the point that is most worrying is the shattered aspirations of the Palestinian territories and, it has to be said, the shattered aspirations of Israel as well."
"The sooner we have peace, the sooner we can restore a decent standard of living and quality of life for all the people who live in that region."
"Once again, we are witnessing an attack by the Israeli army in Palestine."
"In Europe, we are stepping up the fight against terrorism, yet we are silent in the face of State terrorism which, on a daily basis, kills innocent people who are resisting colonisation and occupation."
"Explain to me why we are refusing to make sanctions against Israel the glue that binds association agreements."
"Why do we keep quiet as Mr Sharon violates human rights, while condemning those elsewhere who flout democratic freedoms?"
"Why do we keep quiet when colonists are occupying a State and their government is ignoring United Nations resolutions?"
"Why should international conventions apply to everyone except Israel, which is carrying out illegal arrests and torture?"
"Why do we send intervention forces to combat ethnic cleansing for certain peoples and do nothing to protect the Palestinian people?"
"We call for justice for some while practising impunity for others."
"Why do you not act now, before it is too late?"
"This extermination is taking place to prevent people from demanding a fair peace, the right to their own country in which they can live in dignity?"
"After this latest genocide, you will say 'never again'."
"Stop this massacre!"
"You have the power to do so."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as may be seen from the agenda, I have been asked to issue a statement today under the heading, 'The situation concerning the International Criminal Court (ICC) following the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers (Elsinore, 29 and 30.8.2002)'."
"I am alert to the fact that the request for this report has to be seen in terms of Parliament's wish to be kept informed of the EU's deliberations following the United States' request for the Member States to enter into bilateral agreements aimed at preventing American citizens from being handed over to the Court."
"It is quite understandable that Members of the European Parliament should be concerned about this matter, just as they were concerned about the United States' ASPA legislation (American Service Members' Protection Act), for it is of crucial importance to us all to insist upon the integrity and effectiveness of the Court."
"I should like to begin by pointing out that, since the Elsinore meeting, there have been further developments concerning the ICC, and I hope that these will have a more positive and long-term effect on the issues that are at present occupying our friends on the other side of the Atlantic."
"The first meeting of states participating in the ICC was held in New York from 3 to 10 September."
"I am pleased to be able to report that this general meeting went well."
"It had been well prepared for by the Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) in New York."
"The present draft documents were finalised thanks to focused and significant contributions from all the delegations in the course of the ten meetings of the Preparatory Commission."
"We can be pleased that the same productiveness and willingness to compromise were manifested during the ICC's first general meeting, so that it was possible to adopt the present documents without anyone's being tempted to re-open the discussion concerning the compromises on which a consensus had previously been reached."
"Now, the time has come to focus upon the International Criminal Court's duties in The Hague."
"It is now up to diplomats and politicians to give the Court the ability to complete what was begun in Rome and continued in New York."
"The ICC must establish itself as an effective and independent institution which can accommodate the demands now made by the international community."
"The Court must exercise its jurisdiction effectively and independently, in the same way that we expect our national legal systems to."
"Naturally, the ICC's ability to function properly will depend upon no serious obstacles being placed in its way."
"That, of course, leads me on to the problem that I mentioned to begin with and that presumably also occupies Parliament a great deal, namely the issue of the United States' request for bilateral agreements on non-extradition."
"As the Presidency has said on previous occasions, the European Union and the United States share the same basic values."
"We both profess freedom and democracy, accountability to the courts and the defence of human rights and of the principle of a society governed by the rule of law."
"We have therefore always thought that the United States should be among the participants in the Rome Statute."
"The United States could make a particularly positive contribution to the Court and to the way it operates."
"Since 1998, we have tried to accommodate American concerns in relation to certain provisions of the Statute but, as the summer showed, these efforts have been in vain."
"MEPs will be familiar with the most recent chapter of the story whereby, in a declaration of 6 May of this year, the United States decided that it did not intend to participate in the Statute that it had in fact signed under the Clinton administration."
"We believe that the United States' decision is wrong, and the European Union has publicly deplored the step taken by the Americans."
"I shall not bore MEPs, or extend the sitting, by providing too many details, but I think it might be useful if I were to take this opportunity briefly to put into context the discussion we had in Elsinore concerning the bilateral agreements."
"The United States' request for bilateral agreements was first discussed by the Council in the Political and Security Committee (PSC) on 26 July."
"There was agreement in the PSC on a provisional common response that the Member States could give to the United States in the course of bilateral contacts."
"The common response essentially consisted of telling the Americans that the EU remains committed to its obligations to support the ICC and the integrity of the Rome Statute; that the American proposal has far-reaching implications necessitating the more detailed analysis in which we also invited the candidate countries to participate; and that we would come back with an answer as soon as the analysis had been completed."
"The Political and Security Committee (PSC) decided to return to the matter at the beginning of September once the Council's experts on international law (COJUR) had discussed the matter on 4 September."
"In the meantime, it was decided that it would be useful to have a short discussion of the matter at the meeting in Elsinore at the end of August."
"There, we agreed that the EU should not accept anything that might undermine the International Criminal Court."
"We also agreed that the EU should not increase the difficulties in relation to the United States. Rather, we should look at possible ways of accommodating the United States."
"We confirmed that the legal experts should examine the matter with a view to arriving at a common assessment which might lead to agreement as to a common and constructive approach on the part of the EU at the Council meeting on 30 September."
"We find ourselves at the end of the period of reflection."
"At their meeting in New York, the United States and the EU agreed to look into whether we could arrive at a common position."
"This also meant that the United States was willing to move for, otherwise, there would have been no basis for further analytical work."
"Some outlines of a common approach are now beginning to emerge, therefore."
"In EU circles, there is agreement that any solution must take account of relevant agreements already entered into with the United States and must be based upon, and reflect, three fundamental principles if the integrity of the Rome Statute is to be preserved."
"Clearly, the present American proposal is irreconcilable with obligations in relation to the International Criminal Court."
"On the other hand, it is no solution, either, simply to reject the proposal outright for that reason. On the contrary, we are trying, as I stated, to find a policy that can both sustain respect for the Court and ensure that we can come to an arrangement with the United States too."
"These principles underlie the issue of preventing the most serious international crimes from going unpunished, the issue of reciprocity and the issue of the categories of person to whom the arrangements are to apply."
"If a solution is to be found to the issue of exemption from punishment, raised by the American proposal, it will have to contain a suitable provision ruling out exemption from punishment for those who have committed crimes covered by the jurisdiction of the Court. That is to say, there must be no exemption from punishment for those who have committed crimes covered by the jurisdiction of the Court."
"With regard to the issue of reciprocity, this is not something we want to see."
"It is unacceptable to arrive at a result that rules out the extradition of citizens of states participating in the ICC."
"When it comes to the categories of person to whom the arrangements would be applicable, the United States wants to see a rule that would exclude everyone, and therefore all Americans, from extradition to the ICC."
"There is agreement in the EU that a solution will only be able to cover specified categories of person from countries not participating in the ICC."
"The issue of specifying in more detail those to whom the arrangements will apply will continue to be discussed up until 30 September."
"I should like to emphasise that our analysis and deliberations have by no means been concluded. Rather, they are continuing."
"As recently as yesterday, the Presidency's legal experts held a meeting with American interlocutors in order to exchange views and information."
"We shall now work hard to achieve a solution that can, if possible, accommodate the United States' concerns without in any way undermining the Court."
"Both through bilateral contacts and at a meeting with the United States' Secretary of State, Colin Powell, we have, as I mentioned, made it very clear how important it is to us that the spirit and letter of the Rome Statute should be respected."
"I also said this at the meetings I had on 3 July and again last week in New York."
"In my introductory speech here today, I emphasised that the time has now come for the International Criminal Court to show that it is in a position to function as an effective and independent court."
"We must hope that the United States can be prevailed upon to adopt a more positive approach once the International Criminal Court has in practice had the opportunity to show that it operates in accordance with the highest standards of the rule of law and does not allow itself to be exploited for political reasons."
"Madam President, I am very pleased to speak today about the European Commission's continuing support for the Rome Statute and for an effective International Criminal Court."
"I believe, as Parliament does, that the creation of the International Criminal Court represents a critical milestone in the evolution of international human rights law."
"No longer will tyrants gain impunity for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity - including widespread murder of civilians, torture and mass rape - by hiding behind the cloak of national sovereignty."
"No longer will the international community have to create international criminal tribunals after the fact - after the crimes that we all deplore have already been committed."
"In the 21st century, potential tyrants and mass murderers will know in advance that the international community is prepared to hold them accountable for massive violations of human life and dignity."
"It is our belief and our hope that this awareness will help to reduce the frequency and the severity of such crimes."
"But when it does not, and the relevant national legal authorities are unwilling or unable to act, the international community will have in place a complementary system of criminal justice that is fair, transparent and effective."
"The European Union fully supports the Court."
"The principles of the Rome Statute, as well as those governing the functioning of the ICC, are fully in line with the principles and objectives of the Union."
"The consolidation of the rule of law and respect for human rights, as well as the preservation of peace and the strengthening of international security, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations, and as provided for in Article 11 of the EU Treaty, are of fundamental importance to us."
"We have committed ourselves to the success of the ICC."
"We have provided funds in projects to support the broadest possible ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute and we have committed more money for that purpose."
"Of course, there is still real work to be done before the ICC can function as intended."
"One challenge is to increase the number and broaden the geographical scope of states that have signed and ratified the Rome Statute."
"As of today, 139 states have signed the Statute, and 81 have ratified it."
"These numbers are impressive, but need to be increased."
"We note a particular gap among Asian States."
"The Commission will continue to make every effort to encourage third countries that have not yet done so to sign and/or ratify the Statute."
"We will also work with states that have ratified the Statute to ensure the timely adoption of national implementing legislation necessary to cooperate with the Court and to exercise national criminal jurisdiction over crimes covered by the Statute."
"At the moment, of course, the most controversial issue is that of bilateral agreements under Article 98 of the Rome Statute, to which the Presidency referred."
"The Commission supports the decision taken by the Foreign Ministers at Helsingør to develop an EU response on Article 98 that seeks to accommodate US concerns without in any way undermining the Rome Statute."
"As soon as the details of the European Union position on Article 98 are completed - I hope by the end of this month - we will work with the candidate and EEA States to maintain a united front on the ICC."
"With regard to the longer term, the Commission also supports an ongoing dialogue between the European Union and the United States on the future of the International Criminal Court."
"An open EU-US dialogue on these matters is critical to the ultimate effectiveness of the Court."
"We disagree with the United States about the Court."
"We are sorry that all the reassurances we gave during the negotiations, and subsequently, have been ignored."
"We are sorry that they have declined to take 'yes' for an answer."
"So be it."
"Without any acrimony, but with steady determination, we must get on with the task of making the Court a success."
"There is an obvious challenge in doing that. That is to ensure that the nomination and election of the ICC's judges and chief prosecutor are fair, transparent and fully consistent with the criteria set out in the Rome Statute."
"Fairness, transparency and consistency are important to ensure the legitimacy of this new institution in the eyes of the whole world."
"European Union Member States should ensure that their handling of this process sets a positive example."
"Parliaments, professional associations, and non-governmental organisations around the world can also contribute to this process by recommending potential candidates for consideration by states parties and by evaluating the qualifications of all those candidates."
"I only wish to add how much the entire Commission appreciates the European Parliament's tireless advocacy on behalf of a strong and effective International Criminal Court."
"We look forward to continuing this positive relationship on behalf of the ICC well beyond the Court's first operational session next autumn."
"Madam President, Mr Møller, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to make two preliminary remarks: firstly, I should like to thank my friend and colleague Arie Oostlander very much for agreeing the motion with the other groups so that tomorrow we will hopefully be able to adopt a broad common position."
"Secondly, we have got into a bit of a muddle with the timetable here and my group's bureau has been meeting since 5.30 p.m."
"It is advisable for the group chairman to be in attendance, so I would crave your indulgence if I leave immediately after my speech, something that I have never done before."
"Why did the international community set up this International Criminal Court?"
"It was set up because the Rome Statute of the Court states that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished."
"That is precisely our group's position."
"Our values are human dignity, freedom, democracy and the rule of law and no one has the right, except in self-defence, to kill another person or wound their dignity."
"This dignity is for everyone, for Jews, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, people of no religious persuasion, people from large and small countries, for all the people on this earth."
"No individual and no country has the right to escape punishment for crimes which concern the international community as a whole."
"No one, no person and no State, is above the law."
"That is why we want the International Criminal Court to be effective and capable of acting, and I very much welcome the clear statements made by both President Møller and Commissioner Patten."
"We expect all EU Member State governments and parliaments to do all they can to ensure that this International Court is able to work properly and effectively."
"We call in particular on the accession countries not to enter into any agreements before we have agreed on a common position within the European Union, and I hope very much that on 30 September you will succeed in drafting such a common position."
"I very much regret the fact that Romania, an accession country, has concluded an agreement without first awaiting the European Union's position."
"It has not acted in solidarity with the European Union."
"In conclusion allow me to say this: despite the fact that the motion naturally contains a certain amount of criticism of the United States, this is no reason for us now to adopt an anti-American attitude."
"This is more an example of a case where our opinions differ, and we should discuss this without by so doing ceasing to be partners and friends of the Americans."
"In a partnership it is usual for differences of opinion to be expressed and in any case we Europeans should act more in unison."
"We have more reason to ask ourselves questions than to criticise the Americans."
"This means that here too European unity is actually already part of the answer."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty on the International Criminal Court is an indispensable instrument to assert international law."
"The founding of this Criminal Court is a European Union project and at the same time it symbolises our system of values."
"That is why this House regards the Treaty as an integral part of the Copenhagen political criteria."
"The principle behind this Treaty is plain and simple."
"Anyone who has committed genocide or war crimes, anyone who is guilty of crimes against humanity should not go unpunished."
"That is why it is completely incomprehensible that the demand should be made that not all criminals should go before the court, but that some of them, regardless of the seriousness of their crime and solely on the basis of owning a particular document, should be excluded from its jurisdiction."
"This demand made by the Bush administration would stand in total contradiction to the aim and purpose of the International Criminal Court."
"It is not only absurd but also unacceptable, and for two reasons."
"It is firstly unacceptable because exempting all of the nationals of a State would mean that the jurisdiction could only be selective and would therefore take the principle of the universality of justice to absurd lengths."
"Secondly it is unacceptable because it views all of the nationals of one particular State as potential war criminals."
"I oppose this generalised anti-Americanism in the strongest possible terms."
"Some States - so far 12 in number - have succumbed to the huge pressure exerted on them by the United States of America and signed a bilateral agreement with the USA."
"I deeply regret this and think that it will have consequences for our relations with these States."
"In any case, tomorrow, in a joint motion tabled by four groups - and it is also exceptional, Madam President, that a joint motion should be tabled in this Parliament - the European Parliament will adopt a very clear position on this."
"Madam President, the establishment of the ICC marks a huge step forward in enforcing, at a global level, the principle of the rule of law which is fundamental to all liberal democracies."
"While ad hoc tribunals, such as those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, are doing invaluable work, there is no substitute for a permanent court with the mandate and legitimacy to prosecute criminals wherever they may hide."
"We need only look at Croatia's refusal to hand over General Bobetko to The Hague on the grounds that Croatia was not the aggressor, to see the problems which can arise."
"In negotiations on the Rome Statute, Europe bent over backwards to achieve an outcome which would accommodate American concerns."
"It is therefore a matter of deep regret to Liberal Democrats in this House that a number of countries have refused to sign the Rome Statute for the ICC."
"These countries include Iran, Iraq, North Korea and the United States."
"If we follow the old adage 'you will be judged by the company you keep', what message does the USA's presence in this group of refusniks send to the world?"
"Especially when taken in conjunction with America's disavowal of the Kyoto protocol, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Biological Weapons Convention."
"It is bad enough that the USA is refusing to ratify the Rome Statute, but to try to strangle it at birth by reaching bilateral agreements with countries such as Israel and Romania in order to prevent its nationals being surrendered to the ICC is terrible."
"UN Security Council Resolution 1422 also sets a dangerous precedent and should not be renewed next July."
"The European Union should do its utmost to avoid undermining the ICC before it has even begun its work."
"I therefore urge the President-in-Office of the Council to recognise the storm-clouds gathering over this issue and to pull the EU Member States together under one umbrella."
"In an age of instability it is understandable that the EU wishes to avoid a breakdown in transatlantic relations, but any agreement with the USA must be supported by all EU countries and be consistent with the Rome Statute."
"Another failure on our part to show unity would further undermine the EU's credibility in foreign affairs."
"We must get our own house in order."
"The countries wishing to join us, including the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Malta, must understand that the values the ICC represents are fundamental to the European Union, and that speedy ratification of the Rome Statute would prevent any delay in their accession."
"We urge Romania not to ratify its bilateral agreement with the USA, and it is also important for the Union to act together within the ICC in terms of financial support and the appointment of judges, the prosecutor and staff."
"By acting together, Europe can contribute greatly to making the ICC work, and thereby reassure the USA that the Court is serious and poses no threat to their law-abiding nationals."
"We must work to bring the Americans on board at a later date."
"Neither government must forget that we are accountable to the court of world public opinion."
"In conclusion, Madam President, the ICC is a symbol of the world for which we strive - a world in which human rights and international law will be upheld everywhere, and most of all, a world in which no shelter will be given to those guilty of the vilest crimes."
"Let us work together to enable the court to get off to a flying start when it becomes operational in January."
"Madam President, I too apologise to the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, but I must leave the debates, since I must chair a meeting of my party."
"Mr President, we have to face the facts regarding the USA, the ICC and the European Union."
"The facts are: the total rejection by Washington of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court; the postponement by the United Nations Security Council, under United States pressure, of any prosecution by the ICC, first until 1 July 2003, and then until 2004 or maybe 2005; and the bilateral agreement on immunity pursued by the United States with some foreign governments, among them two European governments namely Great Britain and Italy, seeking for a law to protect American forces abroad - a law that would authorise military action anywhere, even in the Netherlands, to liberate any American personnel detained by the ICC."
"Do we need any other proof of the intention of the Bush administration to torpedo the ICC?"
"Nowadays there are American troops in 140 countries throughout the world, in more than half of these countries with permanent bases."
"So we are confronted with a superpower which does not allow any other law but its own, on its military forces or its civilian personnel."
"As Commissioner Patten has just stated, grumbling against the United States is no substitute for a European foreign policy."
"I entirely agree with him."
"I hope he will agree with me that lamenting, whining and giving in through endless useless transatlantic dialogue on an issue of such gravity is no foreign policy either."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the middle of an extremely unusual debate."
"With good reason, with very good reason, this Chamber is expressing wide support for the International Criminal Court and widely condemns the stance of the United States, which wants to nip the International Criminal Court in the bud."
"This was most recently illustrated by the very harsh words in the national security plan that is being presented this week."
"Unfortunately, as Mr Møller already indicated, this topic is no longer being debated outside of this Chamber."
"The Council is working on a compromise."
"The question is no longer whether exceptions should be made, but how far they go for the United States."
"With this, a horrible dilemma is being created for Parliament and for anyone who is kindly disposed towards the International Criminal Court, for the choices are: either no compromise, and this translates into a divided Europe and continuous opposition by the United States, or opting for damage limitation, for example, by restricting the exception to soldiers with peace missions."
"This would result in a united Europe, an end to US opposition and quite possibly the withdrawal of this diabolical The Hague Invasion Act."
"These are the true choices we are facing, whether we like them or not."
"This raises the vital question - and I would at the same time make an appeal to Mr Møller, as President-in-Office of the Council - whether this compromise undermines the International Criminal Court permanently and structurally."
"This is where my group draws the line."
"And I would urge Mr Möller to draw the line there in respect of the Council's willingness to strike a compromise."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many people have described the International Criminal Court Statute as the most important international document since the United Nations Charter."
"We Radicals have believed this for many years, and for many years we have fought, as we are continuing to do now, to bring this Court to birth and to see it grow and gradually acquire universal jurisdiction and be recognised by as many countries as possible."
"Many Members have spoken, indeed almost the entire debate has been on the issue of the United States, but I would also point out that many of the world's largest countries - China, Russia, India, Indonesia, the entire Arab world with the welcome exception of Jordan, and almost all of Asia with very few exceptions - have yet to sign on the dotted line."
"There is therefore a great deal of work still to do."
"Of course, it is right to concern ourselves with the issue of the United States, with its attempt to obtain exemption and, in particular, a sort of immunity for its citizens with a diplomatic offensive, but I want to stress here that the European Union must direct its greatest endeavours - and the action plan endorsed by the Council and the Commission's work are important in this respect - towards ensuring that the Court has that universal jurisdiction which will guarantee its authority and status and which will also, indeed, show those who are openly against it like the US administration that, maybe one day, under another administration, their country might change direction."
"Proof of this is the fact that, a few days ago, the former President, Bill Clinton, was publicly criticised for failing to achieve ratification of the Rome Statute when he was President."
"This is important: it is important that the Council adopts a position which gives due consideration to the importance of preserving the Statute in its entirety, that, should a compromise be reached with the United States, it takes into account the question of non-reciprocity - the need for guilty citizens or, at any rate, citizens who have been accused of a crime, to be tried before the US Courts in any case - and, most importantly, that it takes into account the fact that any exception must be restricted, where appropriate, to military and civilian staff sent on mission by the United States and must not be extended, as the United States is requesting, to all US citizens indiscriminately, for this would be absolutely unacceptable and intolerable."
"Madam President, the row between Europe and the United States over the International Criminal Court constitutes a threat to the European Member States' common foreign policy."
"A few weeks ago, things looked set to end in complete disaster when Italy and Great Britain threatened to conclude bilateral agreements with the US, as a result of which certain countries, including the US, or groups of citizens, including American military, would be permanently excluded from prosecution by the International Criminal Court."
"Signing an agreement of this kind must be viewed as detrimental to the agreement of the International Criminal Court."
"I am referring in this respect to the sound legal advice gained by the European Commission."
"Fortunately, the United Kingdom and Italy ultimately did wait for a European consultation, and we in Parliament are now able to give our opinion on this matter in advance."
"The International Criminal Court's very existence is on the line, as destructive bilateral agreements undermine its raison d'être."
"However, the question also arises again of whether Europe is able to speak with one voice."
"Not only as a trading power, but also as a bearer of values and standards in this rough and unsafe world, one that protects human rights and the international rule of law as a whole."
"A divided Europe, in which some Member States want to take advantage of Article 98 to permanently exclude the US or US citizens from prosecution - so including Al Qaeda terrorists with an American passport - damages our ideal of a Europe that contributes to peace, stability and security worldwide."
"According to the ICC Treaty, all nations, including the US, can, and must, tackle their own human rights violators themselves for the first nine months."
"Only when this proves unsuccessful, will the International Criminal Court become involved."
"It therefore depends on national efforts whether the International Criminal Court should actually intervene."
"This should be sufficient guarantee for the US too."
"Europe should therefore remain unyielding and continue to speak with one voice."
"This is why I would ask Member States to abandon destructive bilateral agreements with the US, and urge the Council to remain united."
"Madam President, the aim of the International Criminal Court is to judge the perpetrators of the most serious crimes that have international implications, an aim that is all the more commendable since it was defined at the end of the most crime-ridden century in the history of humanity, a century which saw the genocide of the Armenians in 1916, of the Jews in the 1940s, one hundred million deaths caused by Communism, the Christians of Sudan massacred by Islamic fundamentalists, one million starving children in Iraq because of sanctions on their country ? the list goes on."
"Alas, most of the authors of these crimes have escaped justice."
"Only the German National Socialists and the Japanese leaders were tried by those who defeated them, some of whom should have also been in the dock."
"On the other hand, the international socialists such as Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot enjoyed total immunity."
"Would an International Criminal Court have avoided these crimes, or at least punished the murderers?"
"I have my doubts."
"The ICC member countries do not have the same concept of law."
"The powerful countries will continue to evade the law, and, even here, some speakers such as Mr Poettering have told us that it was wrong for the Romanians to have agreed to conclude bilateral agreements, but the US, which pushed them into this, would not entertain any criticism whatsoever."
"The founding statute of the Court claims that the Court shall only intervene on a subsidiary basis, in cases where the Member States refuse to exercise their sovereign right or are not in a position to do so."
"If that is true, it is difficult to understand the fierce opposition from the United States."
"The abrupt change of direction by the US might well be viewed with a degree of cynicism."
"Madam President, the word Romania has been mentioned several times today already."
"I do not think either that we should criticise only the small poor, destitute countries that are being blackmailed but surely also the large rich ones, the ones actually responsible for the blackmail in the first place."
"This shows that in the European Union we need a calm, unified position on the USA, and we lack this at the moment."
"On the one hand we have a Head of Government in London who acts as though his country were the fifty-first US State."
"On the other, we have a Head of Government in Berlin who to hear him talk would seem to be confusing Baghdad with Washington, and who gets his first message of congratulation after the elections from Saddam Hussein."
"I believe that both of these approaches are wrong."
"We need a calm, unified, but critical and independent position on the USA."
"This is not least in the interests of the USA itself."
"Strengthening international law and its instruments is a fitting response to 11 September; this then includes the International Criminal Court, which we have been fighting for years and which is an indispensable instrument."
"The Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are actually doing an excellent job, but they are repeatedly discredited in propaganda as dispensing victor's justice."
"This is wrong!"
"However, if we are to have objective standards in the long term we really do need to strengthen international criminal law in respect of crimes against humanity and genocide, and we need an International Criminal Court that is there for everyone in an equal capacity."
"We should be clear on one thing: history teaches us that for example the League of Nations failed because this splendid idea emanated from the USA but the USA itself did not participate in it."
"We call on our American partners and friends to work together with Europe to strengthen international law and the Criminal Court, because otherwise we are providing states in the Arab world, but also China and Russia - I might mention Chechnya and Tibet - with a pretext for ignoring international law on their territory."
"That is why Europe needs to speak to the USA in a self-assured manner, but calmly and reasonably and in a spirit of partnership."
"Madam President, the United States has a strange idea of international law."
"Yesterday, we learned that, in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention, Washington is not going to allow inspections to be carried out in US firms, despite the fact that a war is about to break out because of a very similar situation."
"Now, we learn that even the International Criminal Court is considered by the United States to be just another tiresome bee in the European bonnet."
"We are all now quite aware that any bilateral agreement providing for tolerance towards the United States or granting its citizens immunity would run counter to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome."
"We call upon the Council because, to prevent this, we need the explicit and immediate intervention of all the European governments, particularly, Madam President, the Berlusconi Government, which, just a few days ago, hinted that it might allow the US Government to take unacceptable shortcuts, disregarding once too often the fact that, where peace and international law are concerned, there is no difference between civilians and military: everyone is a citizen with the same rights and the same responsibilities."
"Madam President, the setting up of the International Criminal Court is of course a quantum leap in the struggle for human rights."
"On the other hand, the United States' rejection of the ICC is another attempt to weaken the entire authority of the UN."
"It is clear, in my view, that the United States is trying to make use of its position as a superpower merely to take care of its own narrow interests."
"In relation to the ICC, I should like to warn the Council and the Commission against devising a cosmetic compromise in which real immunity for American citizens who have committed war crimes is wrapped up in every conceivable kind of complicated legal hair-splitting."
"An International Criminal Court without American participation is naturally a weakened court."
"An ICC with formal American participation but in which American war criminals remain, in actual fact, immune from prosecution would, however, totally undermine the Court's authority."
"A legal system neither can nor should be set up in that way."
"Madam President, the creation of the International Criminal Court constitutes a step forward for civilisation."
"In order to ensure, however, that the aims of the ICC are fully achieved and that International Law is given greater credibility, its universal implementation must be guaranteed."
"The European Union and its Member States are therefore required to take action to hinder the efforts of the United States of America to strip the ICC of any legitimacy, granting itself a privileged status of immunity by means of illegal bilateral agreements."
"The primacy of the law in the international order over the balance of power and the law of the strongest is a noble-minded idea, which is still a long way from being fully realised."
"The primacy of the law in the international order will remain a pious fiction, however, if the world's only existing superpower refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of the institutions responsible for overseeing the implementation of International Law."
"Such a refusal would even constitute a serious step backwards, because it sends a terrible message to the world community, a sign of the irremediable weakness of principles and of the persistent power of cynicism in international relations."
"The great dilemma facing the international community today is therefore to choose between an order based on law and an order based on the simplistic opposition of the forces of good and evil, in the battle between which the law is seen merely as an unpleasant hindrance."
"Mr President, your statement was not as clear as Commissioner Patten's."
"I am actually seriously concerned that, in spite of their professed commitment to the International Criminal Court, the EU's Foreign Ministers will after all get cold feet on 30 September and issue provisos that undermine the credibility of the Rome Statute."
"If the universality of the International Criminal Court is compromised the Rome Statute is weakened."
"We cannot have two classes of law within international law."
"Article 98 is no basis for bilateral agreements because it was only envisaged for agreements between States Parties to the Treaty."
"It was an article that the United States itself proposed."
"It does not apply between States that do not even want to recognise the International Criminal Court."
"I very much hope, however, that on 30 November the EU will say 'no' and that it will not allow itself to be beaten into submission."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to put Mr Posselt right: the first person to ring Chancellor Schröder after his election was the British Prime Minister."
"Like everybody else I regret the US position, but I have some questions for the Council on the Commission."
"Firstly, are not agreements within Article 98 point 2 consistent entirely with the letter and spirit of the ICC Statute?"
"Accordingly, if they are part of it, surely they cannot be said to undermine it?"
"Secondly, as many countries told the US that rather than reject the ICC outright it should go along the Article 98 point 2 road, is it not difficult to criticise them for doing so?"
"Thirdly, does not the US draft agreement state clearly that the parties expressed their intention to investigate and prosecute war crimes and, therefore, achieves the objective we wish to see?"
"Can we not therefore build on that position rather than try to take extreme positions in this particular debate?"
"Madam President, it is crucial that the EU firmly support the International Criminal Court."
"Firstly, Article 98 of the Rome Statute on the International Criminal Court cannot be used as the USA proposes."
"It is only applicable to NATO or similar organisations' Status of Force Agreements designed to protect soldiers from sending States, but it cannot be applied generally to US troops or US citizens."
"Secondly, any country that enters into a treaty with the USA is not just in breach of the Rome Statute, but also of international law."
"In its treaties with Romania and others, the USA proposes not just that US citizens should not be brought before the Court, but also that covered agents should not be brought before the court, something that would be devastating for international law."
"Thirdly, the treaties leave the US Government free to decide if they are to be investigated or prosecuted where appropriate."
"This is not just contrary to the Rome Statute but also to the general duty to prosecute international crimes."
"Fourthly, it is not acceptable to undermine the International Criminal Court's role by protecting citizens of the only superpower from being held responsible for serious war crimes, something that would create the belief that only the law of the victor applies."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Parliament for its very strong interest in safeguarding and preserving the ICC."
"It is also the Council of Ministers' view that the ICC should be protected and its integrity preserved and that the ICC should begin operating."
"That is also the Danish Presidency's attitude, moreover."
"Our view is that, on 30 September, we should see to it that the EU countries work together and are also able to arrive at the same result."
"The EU countries should also ideally offer the same response to the United States."
"It should be borne in mind that the task of offering the United States a response is a bilateral one."
"It is not for the Commission to respond to the United States' representations."
"We are concerned here with bilateral approaches, and we can therefore only put forward a recommended response."
"That is all we can do, but I also assume that the recommendation will be followed."
"As Mr Oostlander mentioned, we have had, and are continuing to have, dialogues with the candidate countries on this issue."
"I agree completely with Mr Lund that we must not have a cosmetic and phoney compromise."
"It was certainly something along those lines that Mr Lund said, for it is true enough that, when the rain comes, the façade will crumble and it may mean that everything collapses."
"We are of the view that we must have a global court which will have an effective deterrent effect upon those war crimes described in the statutes of the court."
"With regard to the United States, the fact must be faced that it is not participating in the court, but we shall go on trying to get it involved."
"We have discussed the matter on several occasions with the United States, but to no avail. It is a brute fact, and the choice is between not caring either way or trying to obtain an arrangement whereby the United States is part of an international legal system."
"With this in view, the bilateral approaches can be used to devise an agreement along the lines that I mentioned and that are not at all different from those mentioned by Commissioner Patten."
"There is no difference at all between the Commission and the Council on this issue."
"If wordings can be devised whereby the United States becomes part of the international legal system without being a member of the ICC, that is nonetheless to be preferred to a situation in which the United States is excluded from, and does not have, any such legal system."
"That, moreover, is what our efforts are designed to achieve."
"I should like to point out that the United States does not want to see exemption from prosecution, either."
"Nowhere in Mr Powell's communication does it state that it wants to see exemption from prosecution."
"That has never been the desire on the part of the United States."
"It is a case of it wanting to bring prosecutions themselves, not of it wanting war crimes to go unpunished."
"It is a question of it wanting to do the punishing itself."
"It must be appreciated, moreover, that what is most important is that war criminals should be punished, whether or not we can get them prosecuted in The Hague."
"This is apparent from the letter written by Mr Powell to the individual countries, and also from the remarks he made to the European Union at our ministerial meeting with him."
"In this connection, the principle of subsidiarity, which applies to all of us who are members of the ICC, must be borne in mind."
"There is a principle of subsidiarity."
"The idea, of course, is that the court should only prosecute if the country concerned does not do so itself."
"That is of course the principle."
"It means, moreover, that it might be valuable if the United States were to give a guarantee that it would behave like the rest of us and bring prosecutions itself."
"I also assume that Denmark itself would bring prosecutions, meaning that I do not anticipate any Dane's ending up in The Hague."
"I anticipate our prosecuting war criminals ourselves, if we have any."
"It must, then, be the task of the actual country concerned to say that a particular matter is so serious as to be something that we ourselves should no doubt deal with."
"The court must only be involved if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to deal with the matter."
"Against that background, I therefore cherish a reasonably justified hope that we can grope our way towards a solution whereby the ICC remains unaffected and with its integrity preserved, while still more countries undertake to prosecute war criminals than is the case at present."
"That is of course the crucial point."
"There will be no compromise whereby the court is weakened and the crimes concerned go unpunished."
"That will not happen."
"The answer is yes."
"In connection with this debate, I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37.2 of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is a joint debate on 11 oral questions to the Council and the Commission."
"(B5-0258/2002 and B5-0259/2002) by Mr Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to the Council and the Commission on the situation within Mercosur,"
"(B5-0446/2002 and B5-0447/2002) by Mrs Frassoni, Mr Lipietz, Mr Nogueira Román and Mr Mayol i Raynal, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to the Council and the Commission on the situation within Mercosur,"
"(B5-0449/2002 and B5-0450/2002) by Mr Marset Campos, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, Mr Vinci and Mr Modrow, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to the Council and the Commission on the situation within Mercosur,"
"(B5-0451/2002 and B5-0452/2002) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, Mr Oostlander and Mr Morillon, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to the Council and the Commission on the crisis in the Mercosur countries,"
"(B5-0453/2002) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to the Commission on Mercosur,"
"(B5-0454/2002 and B5-0455/2002) by Mr Queiró, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group to the Council and the Commission on Mercosur."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the joint resolution on Mercosur - which we support - is a balanced reflection of the European Union's concerns regarding the extremely serious crisis affecting Mercosur and which threatens to affect the Andean Community of Nations."
"The resolution firmly expresses the solidarity that the Europeans share with the peoples with whom we have so many historical ties through friendship and even family."
"Unfortunately, this solidarity is not expressed by means of a co-ordinated position of the Member States in the international financial institutions, which are in fact largely responsible for the disaster in Argentina, as a former IMF Chief Economist, Professor Stieglitz, demonstrated so well."
"The resolution quite rightly calls for our policies to be co-ordinated in order to provide financial aid to the Mercosur countries and to include these new guidelines in the EU-Mercosur agreement that is currently being negotiated."
"These negotiations also cover external debt, the ethical position of businesses and the European banks."
"So, there are many good resolutions, and yet the issue remains and will without a shadow of a doubt be raised in the US: does Europe really wish to save South America?"
"In order to calm the fears of our Mercosur partners, we must listen to their demands and dot the i's and cross the t's."
"Hence the three amendments that we tabled to our own resolution: firstly, the very clear rejection of financial conditions which would further exacerbate the poverty of the Mercosur peoples, such as lowering salaries or making cuts in public services."
"Secondly, Europe's renunciation of its subsidies for agricultural dumping for exports that are largely responsible for Mercosur's difficulties, and lastly, the creation of a bilateral citizen's committee so that the representatives of our societies can be involved in the negotiations."
"Madam President, the crisis affecting certain countries in Latin America and, specifically, in Mercosur is clear for all to see."
"We must, therefore, devote our full attention to these difficulties, and by 'we' I mean not only Parliament, but also the Council and the Commission."
"These countries are facing political, economic and social challenges that require permanent international cooperation underpinned by a spirit of solidarity and mutual respect."
"Most of us share this objective, although it is felt particularly strongly, as you would expect, by those Member States, such as my own, Portugal, that have special cultural, historical and linguistic links with these countries."
"We believe that relations between the European Union and the Mercosur countries are strategic relations, comparable, incidentally, to those that Mercosur is developing with other parts of the world and to which we usually give priority status."
"I say this not only in light of the already-mentioned principles of solidarity or of the region's defence of the rule of law and of the economic model based on free initiative and on improving working conditions, but also because of the opportunity that a revitalised and concrete EU-Mercosur partnership would represent for a more balanced political and economic profile of the Union and its Member States in that region of the American continent."
"In this context, we ask the Council - in the wake of the recent Madrid Summit - to prioritise cooperation with the Mercosur countries, with this cooperation being translated into practical measures that go beyond rhetorical gestures of solidarity with their peoples."
"Strong political signals that reaffirm European Union confidence in that region must be given, ensuring that cooperation policy is based on the principle of association to the benefit of both parties."
"I should like to make another observation: we cannot combat the phenomenon of the unilateralism being demonstrated by the United States - visible mainly in its external and defence policy, admittedly - only with the criticism that we have been hearing in certain circles of European thought."
"This criticism, which on top of everything is not accompanied by proposals for political and financial measures that would allow us to overcome the causes of an apparent European inferiority complex, could easily be redirected into stepping up strategic actions of this type. These would prove more useful in balancing relations between the two continents in an atmosphere of cooperation and of sharing values common to both."
"Finally, Mr President, the problems that we are seeing in the region must not affect the course of the negotiations currently taking place between the European Union and Mercosur."
"Instead, the crisis - which we know is complex and problematic - must act as a stimulus for an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties to be concluded as rapidly as possible."
"Lastly, we are in no doubt that everyone would gain by taking advantage of the opportunities that these closer ties would normally provide to encourage the rapid recovery of the economies of the Mercosur countries and closer relations with the European Union."
"Madam President, with regard to the systems of preferences referred to many times in the course of the debate, I would say that all the participating Mercosur states can benefit from the EU's generalised system of preferences."
"Particularly through the GSP's generalised systems, they can, as Mr Barón Crespo mentioned, be given the opportunity to increase their own export income, promote industrialisation in their own countries and speed up the diversification of their economies as a stability tool."
"Everyone here must be alert to the fact that the members of the international financial bodies, namely the Bretton Woods institutions, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are sovereign states unto themselves."
"They are not subject to the dictates of the European Council or to joint decision-making by the European Council."
"It is therefore up to these states themselves, and not to the Council, to decide how they are to conduct themselves in these international financial bodies."
"It is nonetheless clear that coordination between the EU Member States in relation to Article 19 of the EU Treaty may be of benefit to their work in these institutions."
"Accordingly, there is in actual fact a degree of informal coordination at intergovernmental level within the framework of the institutions I mentioned."
"With regard to the Member States' efforts to remedy the situation in the Mercosur countries, they are participating fully and actively in the IMF's work to secure stability and sustainable economic growth in the region."
"It would be foolish to do otherwise."
"The arrangements made to support Paraguay, Uruguay and, most recently, Brazil have received backing from the EU Member States, and work is being done on securing a strong, sustainable and credible IMF programme for Argentina, as outlined in the Council's conclusions of 21 January 2002."
"In his question on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, Mr Barón Crespo states that the negotiations concerning the association and free-trade agreement with Mercosur are expected to be concluded in 2003."
"The parties have not set any deadline for the conclusion of the negotiations, the date's depending therefore upon how the negotiations progress."
"In July, the negotiators at ministerial level adopted an ambitious work programme for the next twelve months."
"The European Union has undertaken to reach a comprehensive agreement with Mercosur and make further progress in the negotiations."
"Allow me therefore to conclude that the Council is fully alert to the serious crisis in the Mercosur countries, especially Argentina."
"It is absolutely right that it should be taken seriously."
"We are therefore interested in strengthening relations between the EU and Mercosur and promoting trade, and we also had a meeting with them during the General Assembly in New York last week."
"First of all, everyone here must be aware of the need to go home and say to our own governments that they themselves must work in the IMF on behalf of the institutions and say to the Mercosur countries that, first of all, they themselves must implement the financial changes."
"Madam President, the Commission fully shares the view of honourable Members that Mercosur's financial problems have intensified during the summer."
"The European Union and the Commission are concerned at the financial turbulence that is affecting the entire Mercosur region."
"The turmoil was triggered by the economic and banking crisis in Argentina, which led to spillover effects on other Mercosur countries such as Uruguay and Brazil."
"As a result, the social and economic indicators, as the honourable Member indicated, are pointing sharply in the wrong direction; poverty is increasing and GDP has declined in all Mercosur countries."
"The crisis will require deep economic and political structural reforms."
"The Commission is convinced that one of the answers to the financial and economic turbulence should be deeper and faster regional integration."
"In this respect, the European Union and the Commission strongly support the Mercosur integration process, especially at this crucial moment for the region."
"The European message of support for further integration as one of the responses to the present crisis is confirmed by our strong commitment to intensify and accelerate negotiations for an Association Agreement between the European Union and Mercosur."
"The agreement will create improved market access for Mercosur exports to the European Union and it will strengthen Mercosur as a common market."
"In addition, from the political and cooperation point of view, it will be a clear signal of a strengthening of EU-Mercosur relations."
"As Parliament knows, the EU-Mercosur negotiations are highly ambitious and include three pillars: political dialogue, cooperation and a comprehensive trade agenda."
"To date, we have virtually finalised the political and cooperation chapters."
"At the recent Rio Ministerial Meeting on 23 July 2002 which, as the honourable Member noted, I attended, an ambitious work programme for the trade negotiations was established."
"This includes a ministerial meeting during the second half of next year to kick off what we hope will be the final stage of the negotiations."
"In addition to the interregional negotiations, the Commission has considered additional forms of help to alleviate the Mercosur crisis."
"Firstly, on the trade front, the European Union has taken important decisions to increase the allocation of the Hilton Beef Quota for two Mercosur countries: 10 000 additional tonnes to Argentina and, as a first step, 1 000 tonnes to Paraguay."
"It is also worth remembering that Mercosur countries have benefited, as my honourable friend the President-in-Office pointed out, from the EU GSP mechanism for quite a long time."
"The latest review of the regime entered into force on 1 January 2002 and it should expire on 31 December 2004."
"At this stage it is not possible temporarily to adjust GSP preferences only for the Mercosur countries, as some have suggested."
"However, we remain committed to helping Mercosur countries to benefit further from the current system."
"There has also been coordination of the positions taken by our Member States on the South American crisis by means of Council common positions and public statements on Argentina."
"It must be said that this falls short of actual coordination of positions in the International Monetary Fund."
"The Mercosur crisis shows that it would desirable for the European Union to speak with a single voice and play a more influential role in international financial matters."
"As Parliament knows, the European Commission cannot intervene as such in the definition of the criteria imposed by an international organisation like the IMF - in which, as I have said, European Union Member States are represented - for the grant of loans to certain countries in a crisis situation."
"The approval of IMF assistance as such is based on its own criteria and is tied to sustainable economic programmes proposed by the governments of the countries affected by financial or economic problems."
"We believe it is only natural that the conditions imposed by international organisations like the IMF for the concession of loans for the structural adjustment of countries undergoing a crisis are different from those set by international cooperation organisations like the UN Development Programme for the concession of grants."
"These organisations have different objectives, which explains why the UN Development Programme puts more emphasis on the social component of cooperation."
"But above and beyond any discussions on the merits of any of the criteria used by international organisations, we should not lose sight of the fact that the crisis requires fundamental economic reform in the region as a whole."
"Finally, the Commission adopted in August a substantial cooperation package in favour of the Mercosur countries covering EUR 200 million for the period 2002-2006."
"These programmes will support regional integration, economic reform, social development and poverty alleviation, modernisation of the state and protection of the environment."
"Furthermore, an additional EUR 48 million for the period 2002-2006 has been allocated to cooperation with Mercosur as a whole and it is focused on three priority areas: support to the implementation of the Mercosur internal market; support to Mercosur institutionalisation; and support for civil society in Mercosur."
"In sum, there is a package of EUR 250 million to be made available in the period 2002-2006 - of which EUR 30 million are planned to be committed in 2002."
"I hope this is another sign of our long-term commitment to Mercosur."
"Let me make one final brief point."
"We have just held meetings in Copenhagen with the ASEM countries and individual meetings with South Korea, China, and Indonesia."
"In the last few years - at least until the recent crisis, and for a change - European investment in Latin America outstripped investment in Asia."
"It is interesting to compare the two regions and to compare for example the savings ratio in Asia with that in Latin America."
"Because domestic savings are so much lower in Latin America, it has depended much more on foreign direct investment in order to promote economic growth."
"The problem in today's liberalised global market is that just as money can go in, so it can just as rapidly go out again."
"The only answer to poverty in Latin America is sustainable economic development."
"We can only have sustainable economic development when we have sustained investment."
"So there is a very strong argument for trying to increase domestic savings ratios in Latin America and for looking at financial flows in the way that Chile did a few years ago and trying to ensure that they become stabilising rather than destabilising factors."
"Madam President, if I am not mistaken, Parliament and the Commission agree on the essential points: trade barriers need to be dismantled, integration needs to be fostered, Europe needs to speak with one voice in the IMF, and so on."
"I do not wish to repeat it all. I should just like to make two short comments and refer to Mr Patten's final remarks."
"Firstly, I have been working on Latin America for many years and - to my horror, I have to say - I have observed that Latin America's importance on the world stage is diminishing further every year, while Asia's is growing."
"There must be reasons for this, reasons that are far more complex than just a measure or two."
"We should discuss this openly."
"The second comment that I wanted to make concerns a survey that was carried out recently in Latin America."
"Part of the population - around 20 000 people - were asked whether they believed that authoritarian governments were better able to solve the problems than democracies."
"In 1996 in a similar survey only a minority put an authoritarian regime first; the majority was in favour of democracy."
"Today over 50% of the population are saying: yes, we need authoritarian governments to solve our problems."
"This means that the crisis that we are facing today in Latin America, and in particular in Mercosur, also presents a risk to democracy."
"This reminds me of the eighties and early nineties when our debates on Latin America mainly concerned democracy."
"At that time we understood that we needed to pursue a social and economic policy that restored people's faith in democracy."
"That is why I do not think that it is pointless for us to concern ourselves with Latin America; if we do not then we will only end up drafting more motions on dictatorships."
"Madam President, it is with pleasure that I am standing in for Mr Andria, who is absent for personal reasons, in a debate on a subject which I consider to be extremely important, for, having taken part in the Johannesburg Earth Summit, I have realised that there is great social divide between the Mercorsur countries."
"The social and economic crises constantly afflicting these countries are preventing economic growth in South America and hindering the implementation of a sustainable development programme because of the frequent economic problems caused by structural instability."
"I therefore firmly believe that the European Union must place South America and the Mercosur countries at the centre of its focus, although not to the detriment of the environmental protection policy, of course, which is becoming an essential tool for the preservation of green areas which are part of the world's heritage."
"To this end, the creation of a special trade programme for countries in difficulties and the promotion of agreements with international bodies which can successfully reduce the crisis threatening the stability of the entire continent would seem appropriate."
"In my view, we need to review the trade agreements we have with these countries and relations between Europe and Mercosur."
"The barriers to trade, the constraints on trade between the European Union and South America, need to be removed in order to boost the world's economy, which is under threat from these crises."
"We must not forget that Europe is the principal trading partner of the Mercosur countries, and it would be easier for these countries to recover and to resolve their socio-political problems if they were economically stable and opened up to trade."
"We need to renegotiate the external debt and establish a system of equality between the different Mercosur countries in order to protect fundamental human rights and prevent the emergence of socio-cultural problems such as those currently afflicting the continent."
"Madam President, I am in favour of the solidarity fund."
"To my knowledge there is no ban on criticising the International Monetary Fund or similar institutions and I do not regard them as sacrosanct."
"I was also pleased to hear Commissioner Patten say that certain import quotas in the agricultural sector have been or are being increased."
"I think, however, that even if we doubled or tripled all of these measures, we would not get to the root of the problem."
"Mercosur has everything it needs."
"It has oil, gas, all the important raw materials, and enough agricultural products to feed not only the whole of Latin America but Europe as well. It has a competent workforce and it has a diverse industry."
"I should like to take up something that Mr Linkohr said: the causes of this crisis run deeper, and not only economic reforms but also political reforms are necessary."
"It is precisely the most important Mercosur States that have far-reaching political problems."
"They have inefficient and, in some cases, corrupt political systems."
"Anyone who has been to a rich, thriving country like Argentina and seen the desperate demonstrations by people from the entire political spectrum outside the Casa Rosada in Buenos Aires, calling for the resignation of all politicians in all parties, because they will not accept anyone anymore, can see quite clearly that this crisis is not a passing phase; it is democracy and the political system that is undergoing a fundamental crisis."
"That is why we obviously want to take individual steps, but without a thorough reform of the political system in Argentina, but also to some extent in Brazil, this continent will not shake off the crisis."
"So far, it must be seen in a positive light that, as a market, Mercosur has had the effect of preventing the worst - they have limped along by supporting each other - but in the long term the political system really needs to make a full recovery."
"Madam President, despite the accounts given in the media, the 'Latin American' question is not on the agenda and we cannot, therefore, analyse either the causes or the consequences of what is happening there."
"Europe has been irresponsibly negligent with regard to this matter, and we must drop this approach without further delay."
"I believe that we have serious moral responsibilities towards Latin America and that the North/South dialogue and cooperation and development are meaningless unless we translate our words into action."
"We must, therefore, give coherence to the entire range of means with which Europe can act, from overcoming the differences within the Council - we could begin there - to effective and personalised intervention in the name of Europe in the framework of the IMF, to the possibilities opened up by our preferential trade mechanisms, to financial aid and the accession agreements."
"Madam President, all of this will mean a very considerable effort by Europe to reaffirm, as the resolution quite rightly states, our commitment of solidarity towards Latin America, which is also a commitment to democracy in the world."
"In connection with this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 42.5 of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0293/2002) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels."
"Mr President, I am probably going to be the only person here tonight with my position on this particular report."
"This report is viewed with extreme concern, regardless of what the rapporteur has said with regard to the United Kingdom."
"It will have an adverse effect on our agriculture, our farmers and our fishermen."
"Where I come from in Northern Ireland the rural community is falling apart."
"To put any added burden on it at this moment in time is quite wrong."
"I want to make it very clear from the outset that I, my delegation, and those I represent are totally in favour of improvement to the highest possible standards. I will support those higher standards."
"But I have a problem when we impose from on high purist-type ideas on those who cannot defend themselves."
"That is what I oppose."
"I am totally opposed to trying to impose this on off-road vehicles, be they vehicles that are used on farms, or the many other vehicles used in quarries or elsewhere."
"If we have to, let us set standards somewhere down the road longer-term."
"Let us work towards that as technology develops, but to sit here and say that we can impose this from this European Parliament is totally unacceptable."
"If you want to know why Europe is unpopular in many areas of the European Union, just look at this type of proposal."
"What do the people say?"
"They say 'Oh, there is Big Brother Brussels telling us what to do again'."
"Why do we not use common sense?"
"Why do we not use our own initiative and not have the European Union hurting its own citizens while the rest of the world merely goes on its way destroying the environment?"
"We have seen from Johannesburg and from Kyoto and elsewhere that they do not pay a jot of attention to what we say."
"I understand that off-road vehicles account for about 8.5% of the diesel vehicles in the European Union."
"Commissioner, it is within your and the Council's powers to at least take a balanced position on this and to achieve the aim over a longer term so that we do not hurt a lot of people on the way."
"That is what I support."
"I will certainly be voting against this recommendation tomorrow."
"I, along with the people I represent, will take great delight in voting against it."
"I hope it is defeated because then in the longer term you will come back with a proposal that represents the common sense view of everyone in this European Union, and not just those with purist ideals who do not have to face the consequences of imposing their ideals on others."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0288/2002) by Mr Callanan, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position on recreational craft."
"Mr President, I have a few points to make, but I can see that the debate has hardly engendered rapt enthusiasm among the packed ranks of Members so I will be as brief as possible and let everybody get away for their dinner."
"I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner and all those who have taken an interest in the report for being here this evening."
"It might be a minor subject, but it is very important to those involved in the recreational boating industry and those many thousands of people across Europe who also indulge their hobby of boating."
"Many of the problems apparent in the legislation at first reading have been substantially resolved by the Council at second reading."
"Most of the retrospective elements in the proposal at first reading have now been removed and I can broadly support the Commission's proposals at second reading, albeit with a few riders."
"I tabled a few amendments for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, some of which were accepted."
"Most of the technical amendments we put forward were accepted."
"I shall just run through a few of the problems that I still see with the legislation."
"I continue to have doubts about the effectiveness of a regulatory committee, particularly one empowered to alter quite important items of the directive such as Froude numbers."
"The committee supported my recommendations on that and the amendments are up for vote tomorrow."
"I continue to believe that craft built for users' own use should be exempted for five years, provided they are not placed on the market."
"This directive was introduced under single-market legislation and it is self-evident that if those craft are not intended to be placed on the market, then they cannot affect the single market."
"The issue of in-use compliance testing is a particularly thorny one."
"I understand that at some stage the Commission will be coming back with proposals on that."
"I hope it will consider that issue very carefully."
"The last thing we want is an extremely bureaucratic system imposed on the boat owners and users of Europe."
"It needs to be very simple and effective and, above all, free of charge to those who have boats at the moment."
"Finally, I should like to tell our German colleagues that a number of amendments - I call them the Bodensee amendments because they are the result of lobbying from the Lake Constance authorities - have been tabled."
"There are broadly two categories of amendments."
"Firstly, those tabled to allow Member States to set their own limits in particular local circumstances."
"I am not usually against Member States derogating from European regulations, but if we are going to produce a directive whose specific purpose is to permit a single market across Europe and then introduce specific exemptions into the directive, that would defeat the whole point of having it in the first place."
"Secondly, I have a particular problem with the so-called Table 1a amendment, again based on the Bodensee limits, but even stricter. Again it would be a barrier to trade."
"However, I would say to our colleagues on the Bodensee that, if there is a problem in this particular stretch of water, then, firstly, there is no evidence that it is caused by recreational craft and, secondly, that if there is a difficulty it can be solved by local measures in the area of Lake Constance."
"Speed and navigational limits could be imposed, and I entirely support their right to do that. But do not saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits just to solve a particular problem that the German and Austrian authorities might have."
"I have looked quite extensively at the limits proposed in that table with boat-users' representatives and representatives from industry, and there are no commercially available engines on the market that meet those limits at the moment."
"Obviously technology could be developed further, but it would require the use of catalytic converter technology, which is extremely difficult in a marine environment."
"By all means let the research go ahead, let us look at the issue again in a few years, but please do not try and saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits."
"All that would happen - because there are no retrospective elements - is that, as has happened on the Bodensee, the whole of Europe would become pretty much a museum for old engines."
"The companies making new engines go out of business, but those refurbishing old engines continue to make a lot of money."
"The engine could be old, polluting or spilling oil into the water but, as long as it was in existence at the time the limits were introduced, it would be perfectly legal."
"It is completely self-defeating to impose unachievable limits."
"I would strongly recommend the House to vote against those amendments tomorrow."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, for the general support in their report."
"The Commission's proposal to modify the recreational craft directive aims to avoid fragmentation of the internal market and seeks to integrate environmental concerns."
"As such, this proposal provides a good example of the synergy that is needed between environmental and industrial policies for the achievement of sustainable development."
"Air and water pollution and engine noise from recreational boating activities have become increasingly sensitive issues."
"While exhaust emissions from recreational craft contribute little to the overall pollution of the marine environment, their local effects are nevertheless important."
"Recreational boating activities are often concentrated in environmentally sensitive areas so it is important that this activity does not disturb local fauna."
"Moreover, boating activities often take place at the weekend and in holiday periods resulting in a concentration of the nuisance they can cause to local inhabitants."
"I share with Mr Callanan the hope that the amendments that are adopted will deal appropriately with the need for harmonised reduction of exhaust and noise emissions, while at the same time avoiding over-regulation."
"I therefore welcome in particular Amendment 14 to extend the 3 decibel sound allowance to the scope originally proposed by the Commission."
"The Commission can also agree with Amendments 6 and 21 as they will provide for consistency in the references to 'placing on the market and/or putting into service' throughout the directive."
"Also the first part of Amendment 1 can be accepted, since it provides an improved wording of the recital."
"Amendments 4, 5, 12 and 22 re-introducing the proposals to delete or reduce the provisions on the Regulatory Committee cannot be accepted by the Commission."
"A regulatory committee is necessary for the efficient implementation and the regular updating of a specified range of technical elements contained in the technical annexes to the proposed directive."
"This approach is in line with the principles of better regulation."
"Another important topic of debate has been that of the right to adopt more stringent requirements at national level."
"Amendments have also been tabled to introduce at Community level more stringent emission limits on standing inland waters."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, second part, 11 and 13, as they would fragment the internal market."
"Amendments 16 to 20 and Amendment 24 envisage changing the scope and timing of future work to be undertaken by the Commission."
"They cannot be accepted as they would restrict the Commission's right of initiative."
"In conclusion, the Commission can accept the first part of Amendment 1 and Amendments 6, 14 and 21."
"On the contrary the Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, second part, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 to 20 and 22 to 24."
"The Commission is looking forward to working with Parliament and the Council towards a solution which on the one hand guarantees a high level of environmental protection and on the other hand meets the requirements of the internal market."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for their efforts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this morning we had a three-hour debate on sustainable development."
"At the World Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union advocated a global water initiative."
"This should make it possible to realise the aims of the World Summit on Sustainable Development - access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation."
"So what are we doing, we who want to achieve such ambitious targets at international level, here in our own countries in Europe?"
"We are making a law on abating water pollution that will reinforce the use of yesterday's technology for tomorrow's developments."
"That, at any rate, will be the result if the opponents of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy succeed in defeating them in plenary."
"Regrettably they include our rapporteur, who actually ought to represent the opinion of the majority of the committee."
"Unfortunately, amongst these opponents of advanced technology are also colleagues from groups and countries which are usually in the vanguard of any initiatives to protect water and the environment and cannot go far enough."
"Go and stand sometime at a filling station in a large harbour for recreational craft; you will see the quantities of fuel, diesel, petrol and oil that are pumped into the tanks of these boats."
"A considerable proportion of this fuel, although it depends on the design, is discharged directly into the water - without undergoing combustion - along with the exhaust emissions, because the exhaust pipe is under the surface of the water."
"The pollutants accumulate in inland waters and lakes, which are frequently used for the abstraction of drinking water."
"Nowhere else is the exchange of pollutants so great."
"It is precisely on lakes that the density of boats is often particularly high."
"That is why we want more stringent requirements for these waters, that is, stricter limit values for recreational craft."
"The technology, Mr Callanan, is available."
"As an engineer you ought actually to be aware of this."
"Since existing craft will enjoy absolute protection and be able to be used until the end of their life, the argument of our Nordic colleagues does not hold water either."
"The limit values laid down now will only have to be complied with by boats newly brought onto the market from 2005."
"An individual who buys a new recreational craft after 2005 will be able to use it on all waters."
"That is why I would urgently request your support for Amendments Nos 1, 11 and 13."
"By adopting these amendments we Europeans would be putting our words in Johannesburg into action."
"Mr Callanan, I have already heard your arguments almost word for word here in plenary; it was nearly 20 years ago in the mid-eighties, in the last century, when we were debating limit values for cars and the introduction of new technology."
"Then, as now, your country was the first to slam on the brakes."
"It is quite astonishing that in two decades you have not learnt any better."
"I believe that water is also the life of the future."
"We must do all we can to prevent our waters from becoming even more polluted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive concerns the exhaust and noise emissions of petrol and diesel engines intended for recreational craft."
"We also have these regulations for cars and that certainly does not mean that if our cars meet these standards they too are permitted to be driven anywhere."
"At present, for example, there are rules limiting the number of boats on lakes to 100 or even 2 per lake."
"It is possible to ban recreational craft from lakes entirely."
"There are time restrictions, limiting the use of boats only to certain hours each day."
"In the end, this directive does not confer any right to operate recreational craft on all lakes at all times and under all possible conditions; all it does is allow free trade in boats and their licensing and it permits them to be used in authorised areas."
"All of us in the European Union value the principle of harmonisation, but only where minimum standards are set so that these technical products can also be used."
"As you know, we in Parliament - and in particular in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy - attach the utmost importance to the principle of mutual recognition, and I believe that this directive makes boat licensing possible."
"We see it as very positive that the general standards in the European Union are being raised substantially here."
"This would also automatically have an impact on the market, because with higher standards proportionally more boats would be permitted on the waters of Member States."
"If the standards are very low, the Member States will quite certainly take matters into their own hands by prohibiting the use of recreational craft on certain lakes altogether or by imposing time restrictions, for example by only allowing boats to be used in May or June."
"There is therefore sufficient room for manoeuvre here."
"It is precisely from this point of view that it is necessary to alert individual drivers, as part of their training for their motorboat licences, to the environmental and noise problem, as well as to the problem of exhaust emissions."
"There are countless regulations here and these are of course very important in the individual countries."
"We should also observe how this directive develops in the future, because it is in all our interests - everyone in this House will agree - to have environmental regulations that are as good, rigorous and sustainable as possible."
"The sportsmen and -women who operate these boats are also keen to have the best possible boats, so the switch to a new generation of craft certainly has to be in all our interests."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission (B5-0491/02), on behalf of the Group of the Europe People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on the review of trademark rights."
"Mr President, may I begin by expressing my disappointment that the people who have drafted this question are not here."
"Despite that, I would like to answer the question, if only for the record and because other Members present might be interested in the Commission's answer."
"I shall begin by thanking Members of this Parliament for the interest they have shown in this important issue, namely the exhaustion of trade mark rights, whether internationally or just in Europe."
"As Members may know from our previous discussion on this issue which took place almost exactly one year ago - on 2 October 2001 - the Commission undertook to prepare a report to Parliament on this subject by the end of this year."
"As I stated in our previous discussion, I do not intend to reopen the investigation of issues that the Commission has already studied."
"Moreover, I explained at that meeting last year that the Commission would only reconsider its decision not to propose a change to the current EU exhaustion regime if new developments justified that."
"To date, there have been no such developments."
"Moreover, and as this relates more specifically to the questions raised by the Members of Parliament who drafted the question, I said last year that the Commission would limit itself to investigating cases of possible abuse of trade mark rights, and especially, but not only, competition aspects."
"I would like to make it clear to Members of this Parliament that the Commission has acted fully in accordance with the commitments I made on 2 October last year."
"I should like to add that in July this year, my services sent out questionnaires to over sixty companies and organisations representing many small and medium-sized enterprises, including both parallel traders and trademark holders, who might be at most risk from abusive restrictions on the sale in the Community of trademarked goods."
"The results of this investigation, combined with our ongoing consultations with other Commission services - in particular our colleagues in the Directorate-General for Competition - should allow us to build a clear picture of whether trademark rights are indeed being abused by right holders to stifle legitimate trade."
"That report, as promised at our previous meeting, will be transmitted to Parliament by the end of this year."
"That is my answer to the question."
"I shall be most interested to hear what Members have to say about it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I should like to apologise for my late arrival."
"The car that was supposed to collect me came half an hour later than arranged."
"That is why I unfortunately only heard part of your speech."
"However, I grasped the main points. Commissioner, the committee and indeed Parliament has not raised this matter lightly or for fun, but because we do not believe that the NERA study, on which you are relying, actually provides a solid enough basis on which to make decisions of this kind."
"In other words, our main premise is that it has been proved, without the need for a NERA study, that these goods - which are everyday items, which every woman and every man buys, in particular those from the poorer sections of the population - for example jeans, shirts, polo shirts, trainers and suchlike, are being offered for sale outside the EU by the same brand manufacturers at the same quality standards for half the price or even less."
"That is one of the reasons."
"The second reason is that in our view the purpose of trademark law is not to seal off markets, allowing there to be different price systems inside and outside the EU, especially more expensive prices inside the EU and more reasonable ones outside; rather we are of the opinion that this is a matter for competition and not trademark law."
"The function of trademark law is to name, describe and unambiguously classify the manufacturer, the brand and the product and to confer certain rights on the trademark holder."
"These rights are justified and we will do all we can to defend them."
"A completely different, separate issue is, however, that of exhaustion."
"In Germany, for around 100 years from the advent of trademarks we had international exhaustion."
"With this system of international exhaustion in place we in Germany achieved the economic miracle, significant growth and much more besides. In the last five years, since European trademark law has come in, we have observed a system of dual pricing, and we have observed that trademark law has become a preferred option for companies because it is far easier to assert your rights under trademark law than it is under other rights procedures, which are actually product-related, such as rights relating to design, patent and copyright; it is more difficult to present your case here."
"That alone is the reason and trademark law cannot after all be stronger than competition law."
"That is why we asked these questions."
"That is why we have asked you in the Commission not to rely on a NERA study but to conduct your own investigations into these specific matters and to answer on that basis."
"Finally there is another question that has arisen since our past discussions on trademark law: what about trade on the Internet?"
"There is of course nothing wrong with the Internet."
"We promote it."
"If someone outside the EU makes a purchase and the dealer dispatches the goods in the EU then this contradicts current trademark law."
"This cannot be the intention of trademark law either."
"Once again then we would urgently request the Commission to conduct further investigations into these few points and to inform Parliament of the result, and not to refer to a NERA study which in our view does not address these problems."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, despite having subscribed to the Mayer Report, I was somewhat surprised by the question put to the Commission, since the prescribed timeframe for carrying out these studies was not respected."
"What is more, I am convinced that the transition from a Community-wide exhaustion of trademarks to an international exhaustion might have negative effects from both an economic and legal perspective."
"Neither the NERA study nor that carried out by the Economist Intelligence Unit proved that the international exhaustion of rights system has a significant long-term effect on prices for the consumer."
"The consumer would not benefit from such a change and I have here an article published recently in the Evening Standard on 4 September, pointing out that Tesco, which is well-known for its support of the international exhaustion of rights system, has not passed on considerable savings made through parallel imports to the consumer."
"Furthermore, if we wish to adopt international exhaustion, we must amend not only the 1988 Directive, but also the 1993 Regulation establishing the Community trade mark and laying down the rule of Community exhaustion."
"It would be inconceivable for the international exhaustion to apply to the national trade mark and the Community trade mark to be exempt."
"A solution of this kind would certainly spell the end of national trade marks which are highly valued by Member States and which are needed by businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, in the frequent cases when a protection throughout EU territory is, in their view, worthless and costly."
"More than ever in a context of heightened globalisation, we must affirm the economic importance of the European Union by integrating the single market and attaching more value to our creativity."
"Neither the United States nor Japan has adopted international exhaustion of trade marks."
"If the European Union unilaterally decided to transfer to this legal system, it would introduce distorted competition between the European Union and third countries."
"Trademark protection is crucial for the European economy and for consumer safety."
"A trade mark is the guarantee of a product's authenticity and quality."
"Furthermore, the current system allows us to better protect ourselves from counterfeiting; since parallel imports pose a major risk as they use the same channels as pirated products and counterfeits."
"A question was raised by Mr Mayer, but I, on the other hand, am thinking about another question which I believe to be crucial: why has the European Union not yet signed the Madrid Protocol, which would enable us to provide an integrated, efficient, global and transparent trademark protection system?"
"I am therefore hoping and praying that the European Union will sign this protocol."
"Mr President, I should like to take Commissioner Bolkestein back to the last part-session here when we discussed sales promotion."
"He may remember that I complimented him because he had written an article in a journal complimenting Parliament on rescuing the internal market."
"It is slightly disappointing therefore to find him back here at the following part-session adopting such a cautious approach on such a fundamental single market issue."
"In this case we are not talking about the single European market. We are talking about global markets and about the freedom of consumers to be able to benefit from lower prices for identical goods that are placed on the market, quite legitimately, outside the European Union, and which are then imported."
"I want to remind him - and he cautiously skirted around this in his answer - that we are discussing an archaic piece of legislation."
"The Trademarks Directive in its original form was certainly introduced to protect trademarks and to secure consumer confidence that they would know what they were buying."
"But subsequently, in cases before the Court of Justice, it is now being further elaborated into a means whereby trademark owners can actually protect their brand, or supposedly protect their brand and their authorised distribution systems, by essentially keeping prices higher artificially."
"He asked us quite rightly to say what has changed."
"I shall tell him what has changed."
"The first thing is that consumers are getting increasingly irritable about what they see as the failure to act on what ought to be a fundamental right."
"That consumer pressure was quite rightly cited by his colleague, Mr Monti, when we had a complete and total reform of the legislation relating to the selling and servicing of motor cars."
"What has that done?"
"It has opened up the distribution system across the European Union."
"Essentially, cars will be available across borders much more freely than they were before and prices which differ from one market to another will clearly converge."
"So why should this be any different?"
"I have to disagree with my colleague Mrs Fourtou."
"It is not a question of counterfeiting or other spurious issues."
"Surely the reason we have so many of these counterfeit brands is because the genuine brands are prevented from being sold at the price that consumers want to buy."
"It is a circular argument."
"I hope that in the July report he has commissioned he will have the facts available and that he will be able to meet the deadline of the end of December that we asked him to meet. This needs to happen so that we can come up with a sensible balanced view, not looking to the past, looking at all the evidence, to the benefit of consumers."
"We need to continue together with the Commissioner the task of creating a true single market for consumers."
"I hope he will give us an assurance this evening that he is prepared to move from his overly cautious approach and join with us in the crusade to give consumers across Europe a better deal."
"I should like to thank the Members who have spoken on this subject very much for their views."
"I shall start with Mr Harbour, who has in his usual eloquent manner impressed the Commission with the need to change over to international recognition."
"In his closing remarks he said that he wants the Commission, and this Commissioner in particular, to see that consumers get the benefits to which he says they are entitled so that there can be a true single market."
"I should like to tell Mr Harbour that we already have a single market. That market is confined to the European Union."
"It is not something that appertains to the whole world."
"The Commission is aware that consumers benefit from lower prices."
"That is obvious."
"The Commission is very much in favour of seeing to it that consumers benefit from prices which are as low as possible."
"However, they are not the only ones involved."
"It is not just consumers who are interested in this matter."
"Producers are also involved and, in particular, trademark holders. Just as consumers are entitled to the lowest prices that are economically feasible, so the producers of trademarked goods want and are entitled to get protection for their trademarks - but not unlimited protection."
"That is the reason behind exhaustion in the European Union."
"There should certainly be a balance between, on the one hand, the interests of the consumer and, on the other hand, the interests of the producer, and the Commission continues to believe that European exhaustion provides for that balance."
"The Commission has not changed its mind since we last spoke about this issue 12 months ago."
"I accept Mr Mayer's apologies."
"He said the studies are of insufficient quality."
"I do not accept that."
"I do not understand why the NERA study should be of insufficient quality."
"The NERA study, as is well known because it is available, states that the changeover from European to international exhaustion would have a negligible effect on prices."
"Mr Mayer may know that in his country, Germany, there was once a system of international exhaustion."
"Because of the policy accepted in Germany on account of the European Union, the changeover was made from international exhaustion to European exhaustion."
"It was then claimed that certain luxury goods producers had to raise their prices, but we then heard from those luxury goods producers that they had in fact lowered their prices."
"So, in that specific case, international exhaustion did not produce prices any lower than European exhaustion - quite the contrary."
"Mr Mayer may have in mind the studies carried out by the UK and Swedish Governments two years ago."
"Those studies - interesting as they are - showed that there is a great disparity in prices between the different countries belonging to the European Union."
"What stuck most in my mind was the 40% difference between electronic goods sold in Sweden and those sold in Germany, which are almost neighbours, apart from the stretch of water between them."
"A 40% difference in price means that the internal market is not working as it should, because, if it did, prices should be related to objective costs - costs of transport, distribution, etc. But 40% means that other factors come into play."
"40% is far and away bigger than any differences in prices that come into play and are discussed in comparisons between international exhaustion and European exhaustion. So I am afraid that the studies of which the Commission is aware - the NERA study was commissioned by the Commission itself - do not support the view that international exhaustion would lead to lower prices, quite apart from the fact that, as I have said before, the rightholders of trademarks are entitled to proper protection, not unlimited protection, but substantial nevertheless."
"I thank Mrs Fourtou very much for supporting the NERA study."
"She has cited the United States and Japan."
"The Commission agrees with her view."
"As to her question on the Madrid Protocol, I must tell her that this is in the hands of the Council, and the Commission can only wait for the Council to take a positive decision in this area."
"Once again, the report will deal with matters of abuse of trademarks."
"As I have said, the Commission has sent out 60 letters to companies and legal bodies asking for evidence of abuses of trademark rights."
"The answers should be in by the end of September."
"We do not have all the answers yet."
"We shall wait for them to come in. We shall analyse them."
"They will be included in the report due at the end of December."
"I should like to confirm that Parliament will indeed receive that report at the end of December."
"I should like to conclude by stressing that the Commission has an open mind on this issue."
"Only those who have no ideas never change them."
"The Commission is full of ideas and has an open mind."
"It is always willing to reconsider."
"As I said a year ago, the problem is more a lack of definitive evidence showing that there is an advantage in opting for international exhaustion over European exhaustion."
"I do not believe that the Commission should change its policy without clear evidence of there being an advantage in doing so."
"With these remarks, I should like to end my response in winding up this debate."
"Once again, there will be a report at the end of December."
"I look forward to a further exchange of views with Parliament once that report has been brought to the attention of this House."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.35 p.m.)"
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Santini's report (A5-0312/2002)."
"We agree that the EU should establish minimum rules for legal aid etc. We are nonetheless aware of the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position."
"Activities of the European Ombudsman (2001) Deliberations of the Committee on Petitions 2001-2002"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"the report (A5-0267/2002) by Mr Wyn, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2001 [C5-0296/2002 - 2002/2086(COS)], and"
"the report (A5-0271/2002) by Mr Koukiadis, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 2001-2002 [2002/2019(INI)]."
"Mr Söderman, the European Ombudsman, has the floor."
"Madam President, on 1 September 1995 the Ombudsman's office started work."
"From then until 15 September 2002, the office received 10 535 complaints, of which 10 437 have been examined."
"We carried out 1 385 full inquiries of which 19 were own-initiative inquiries."
"1 149 of these cases involved the Commission, 137 cases involved the European Parliament's administration, 53 concerned the Council and 12 concerned the European Investment Bank."
"Looking at the results, 345 cases were settled by the institution concerned, after the Ombudsman had informed it of the complaint."
"In 206 cases a critical remark was made, in 48 cases the inquiry resulted in a draft accommodation or proposal for a friendly solution, most of it achieved a success for the complainant."
"In six cases a special report was made to the European Parliament, in four of these cases Parliament upheld the Ombudsman's recommendations, and two other cases are still pending."
"In 659 cases, a thorough inquiry resulted in the Ombudsman finding that there was no maladministration in the activities of the institution."
"When cases are outside the Ombudsman's mandate, we always try to advise the complainant of another body that could deal with the matter."
"We advised the complainant to go to the national or regional Ombudsman, or petition a national or regional Parliament in 2 293 cases, to petition the European Parliament in 884 cases and to address the Commission in 913 cases."
"Over the years, critical voices have been raised, saying that the Ombudsman is not sufficiently known, and that the results for citizens are inadequate because the institutions neither cooperate nor respect their obligation of good administration."
"Some critical voices have also suggested that the mandate is too narrow and that the European Ombudsman should deal with complaints concerning Community law wherever it is applied in the Union or even be a People's Tribune, always ready to condemn injustice wherever it occurs."
"The European Ombudsman is certainly one of the best-known ombudsman institutions in the world."
"Our information campaign is in 12 languages and addresses 350 million citizens and residents of 15 Member States."
"We have visited every Member State, issued press releases, published information brochures and given many lectures and seminars to publicise the work."
"One of the most effective ways of communicating with such a vast audience is via the Internet."
"Around 2 500 websites contain an active link to the European Ombudsman's site and nearly 42 % of complaints are now submitted electronically, many of them using the on line complaint form."
"The steady increase in the number of complaints is the best proof that the Ombudsman is better and better known."
"Almost 200 new complaints arrive each month, nearly a 300% increase compared with the first full year of cooperation in 1996."
"The results of the Ombudsman's work for European citizens are also impressive."
"As well as obtaining redress in individual cases, we have achieved major improvements in the general functioning of the institution."
"Three of these call for special mention."
"First we persuaded the institutions and some bodies, including the European Central Bank and Europol, to improve public access to their documents."
"Second, an own-initiative inquiry led 17 institutions and bodies to adopt codes of good administration, based on a draft suggested by us."
"Following a special report, the European Parliament last year adopted a revised version of the Code of Good Administrative Behaviour."
"We have distributed this improved version of the Code widely throughout the institutions and to European citizens, whose right to good administration the Code embodies."
"As instructed by the European Parliament, we apply the Code in deciding whether or not there is maladministration."
"The third achievement concerns the Charter of Fundamental Rights, proclaimed in Nice in December 2000."
"The Ombudsman proposed the idea that the Charter should include the right to good administration. This was included as Article 41 of the Charter."
"The Ombudsman has also promoted the full and correct application of the Charter."
"The Union institutions solemnly proclaim the Charter to the citizens as embodying their fundamental rights."
"The Ombudsman therefore regards the institutions' failure to respect those rights in their own activities as maladministration."
"Furthermore, the Ombudsman's proposals to the European Convention include the idea that the Charter should be legally binding wherever Community law applies."
"Contrary to what the critical voices say, the institutions and bodies deserve credit for their mainly cooperative attitude to the Ombudsman."
"They have usually responded properly, fully and promptly to the Ombudsman's inquiries and have been willing to accept the Ombudsman's friendly solutions and draft recommendations."
"Problems have arisen in only a small number of cases."
"In one case concerning access to information, the Commission rejected the Ombudsman's draft recommendation and has failed to act on a resolution of the European Parliament supporting the Ombudsman."
"I regret that this case seems to be part of a more general trend towards the misuse of data protection rules to halt or reverse the commitment to openness."
"Most of the institutions and bodies have also adopted a code of good administrative behaviour."
"I still cannot understand why Parliament's resolution of September 2001, calling for a European administrative law, has not been followed up."
"To me, a uniform set of rules applying to all the institutions and bodies could only enhance the Union's relations with its citizens."
"I also regret that the Staff Regulations maintain the outdated requirement of prior approval of publications by civil servants."
"I acknowledge that the European Ombudsman's mandate is limited."
"I have consistently maintained the view that a network of ombudsmen and petitions committees is needed to supervise the application of Community law by the Member States."
"We have developed such a network, to share information, give advice and ensure that complaints go to the most competent body."
"Further development of the network could help the Commission, as the Guardian of the Treaties, to focus its resources on the most important issues of principle."
"The citizens can never fully believe in the European Union unless Community law is respected at all levels of the Union."
"In future Community law, the Member States could include the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The network of ombudsmen in the Member States could also play an essential role in supervising the application of the Charter."
"The European Ombudsman would be ready to accept responsibility for referring fundamental cases to the Court of Justice, if no solution could be found in a normal ombudsman investigation."
"I do hope that Parliament's representatives in the on the European Convention will support these proposals."
"Finally, I would like to express my thanks to all the institutions and bodies, above all to the European Commission, which has cooperated effectively with the Ombudsman to the benefit of the European citizens."
"I would also like to thank the European Parliament and its Committee on Petitions for their good advice and support."
"Special thanks are due to the chairman of the Committee, Mr Gemelli and the rapporteur dealing with the Ombudsman's Annual Report this year, Mr Wyn."
"I thank you."
"I welcome their proposals for closer cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, which I hope will lead to a concrete outcome to benefit the European citizens."
"Madam President, it is my pleasure in this report to endorse the annual report for 2001 submitted by the Ombudsman, which is a comprehensive and detailed overview of the activities conducted during the year and in particular of all the various cases processed."
"After seven years, the role of the European Ombudsman - to enhance openness and democratic accountability in the decision-making and administration of the European Union - is well established."
"By tackling maladministration in the Community institutions and bodies, the role of the Ombudsman has made an essential contribution towards a Union in which decisions are truly taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen."
"The fact that the number of direct complaints is still on the increase again in 2001 clearly demonstrates that the Ombudsman is reaching more and more people in the course of his activities."
"Despite this steady rise in complaints, the report welcomes the reduction in time taken to deal with each case."
"The present Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, from whom we have already heard, has become a well recognised and respected figure in the European Union and his receipt of awards such as the Alexis de Tocqueville prize further demonstrates this."
"He has even paid a visit to my own country, Wales, showing a commitment and dedication through his work to visit some of the most important places in the world."
"During his time in office he has emphasised the Rule of Law, taking fundamental rights seriously and applying basic principles of good administration, such as transparency, responsibility and respect for citizens."
"This has been done in no less than 15 Member States and through the medium of 12 Community languages."
"He deserves his retirement!"
"The report very much welcomes the fact that the European authorities are increasingly taking action to settle a complaint once they are made aware of the problem in question and that, in other cases, a friendly solution has been arrived at."
"The Ombudsman must also be commended for his efforts to inform more citizens of their right to complain."
"This is a matter that the Committee on Petitions is continually aware of."
"This means that the Ombudsman's work has to include the continuous updating of his website with a view to making his role known to an ever-wider public and to establishing networks of links with regional ombudsmen."
"In this regard the Ombudsman is faced with, on the one hand, wanting to inform as many people as possible of this right to complain and, on the other, remembering that the remit of his office is limited to the Community institutions."
"We in Parliament have a role to play here, in ensuring that we remain aware of the Ombudsman's role and informing citizens of this right."
"The work of the Ombudsman, however, has not been without obstacles during this period."
"In the field of good administration the European Parliament adopted unanimously last September the European Union Code on Good Administrative Behaviour and called on the Commission to propose a regulation on the subject."
"I welcome the Ombudsman's decision to apply the principles set out in this code in his activities."
"I should like to express my disappointment here, however, that the Commission has yet to act on this important request."
"The report calls for Parliament to consider drawing up a legislative initiative report on the basis of this model code under Article 192 and Rule 59."
"In relation to openness and good administrative behaviour this report notes attempts by certain institutions to use recently adopted data protection rules to impose confidentiality on their activities."
"It must be made clear that data protection rules are mainly concerned with the protection of private and family life and certainly should not in any way restrict the information available to citizens on the activities of the European Union institutions."
"With regard to the infringement procedure, the Article 226 procedure, in which the Commission investigates complaints about infringements of Community law by Member States, which continues to be the subject of complaints to the Ombudsman - and this is something with which we in the Committee on Petitions are all too familiar - the report finds that, despite recent improvements, this procedure is secretive, and that the complainant is still not recognised as a participant."
"Delays occur because the Commission has too many cases to deal with."
"The Ombudsman was on the record for criticising the Commission's recent handling of the Greek environmental complaint, in this case involving infringements of Community environmental law by the Greek authorities; enquiries revealed a catalogue of information being concealed, the wrong directive being applied and a failure to ensure that the case was dealt with impartially."
"Whilst we appreciate the hard work carried out by the Commission, the Ombudsman and our Committee on Petitions depend on their investigations being effective, and we must be confident that such cases are being handled correctly."
"Finally, I welcome the offer by the Ombudsman to develop joint activities with the Committee on Petitions with a view to reinforcing the contacts and exchange of experience with national and regional Ombudsmen and committees on petitions."
"Closer cooperation between the European Ombudsman's office and the Committee on Petitions is vital."
"Our work is very much interlinked and we were provided with excellent examples of how this could be achieved when the Ombudsman addressed the Committee on Petitions in April."
"I commend the report to the House and wish the Ombudsman a very happy retirement."
"Madam President, the report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions in 2001-2002, for which I have the honour of acting as rapporteur, and the parallel annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman, which are being debated jointly today, should not be seen as two routine reports."
"And there are very specific reasons why not."
"These reports concern two fundamental rights - the right of petition and the right of complaint - of European citizens."
"These rights are inextricably linked to their nationality and are the main means of consolidating political control by the European Parliament of where and how Community law is being applied by the Community institutions and the Member States."
"These petitions and complaints give us a very specific idea of the degree to which European citizens' expectations of Europe are being fulfilled."
"We can, to a large degree, give real expression to the aim of bringing Europe closer to its citizens, the promised strengthening of the democratic credentials of the European Union and, more especially, of the European Parliament, and the much-vaunted objective of greater transparency, by properly developing the institutions of petition and complaint."
"This being so, I should like, if I may, to invite my honourable friends to carefully study these reports and the proposals, all of which are designed to increase the reliability of the Community institutions and ensure that measures taken are implemented more efficiently."
"Many of these proposals can be implemented within the framework of the current Treaties."
"Others need the Treaties to be revised and the report drafted by Mr De Rossa on behalf of the Committee on Petitions for the president of the convention on the future of Europe is of interest here."
"In both cases, whatever else, these issues should be at the top of the agenda of the political groups."
"As to the proposals contained in my report, which were adopted unanimously by the Committee on Petitions, I should like to start by commenting on one which I consider is of both practical and symbolic value."
"Parliament examines three reports every year."
"The first is the report by the Committee on Petitions, examining the petitions filed by European citizens on shortcomings in the application of Community law by the Member States."
"The second, the Ombudsman's report, examines complaints about the failure of Community institutions to comply with Community law."
"The third, which is submitted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, concerns the application of Community law by the Member States."
"In other words, three reports which are directly related and have common objectives and which do not warrant separate consideration."
"They should be dealt with jointly in a part-session with as much publicity as possible."
"At the same time, in view of the fact that, one way or another, all three reports involve national authorities, such as national parliaments, national courts and national administrative departments, and many of the issues touched on in them depend on their degree of involvement and control, I think that the possibility of these reports being debated in the European Parliament in the presence of representatives of the national authorities should be addressed."
"This will improve cooperation, especially with the national parliaments, and the debate will gain maximum publicity and incite the interest of European citizens."
"Another point to emerge from the study is the increased number of petitions and complaints which, from one point of view, is a good thing, because it shows that citizens are broadly involved in the exercise of these rights."
"But, after a certain point, it creates practical problems which need to be addressed."
"Obviously these problems will increase with enlargement. So, sooner or later, we will need to set these institutions on a new footing."
"To be precise, we shall need to examine the possibility of decentralising services with the help of national ombudsmen or committees on petitions and, possibly, the offices of the European Parliament in the capitals of the various Member States."
"There are other proposals which merit consideration, but there is too little time for me to comment on them."
"I shall confine myself to a few words on the content of the report."
"Social issues were again the most sensitive area in the year under review."
"Problems connected with free movement, such as violation of the right of residence, double taxation, failure to safeguard insurance rights, environmental issues and the recognition of diplomas and skills."
"What is encouraging is that, in numerous cases, once the relevant national authorities were contacted, petitioners obtained justice."
"It is also encouraging that there has been an increase in the number of collective petitions, i.e. petitions with more than a thousand signatures."
"The potential of collective petitions is something we should be looking at, because it also involves non-governmental organisations."
"To close, it would be a huge oversight on my part, in view of the imminent departure of the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, if I were to fail not just to congratulate him but to express my admiration for the work he has done, work which justifies the institution of the ombudsman in the eyes of the citizens of Europe and leaves behind it an important heritage which needs to be safeguarded and strengthened in the future."
"Madam President, the annual debate on the activities of the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman focuses our attention on the relationship between citizens and the institutions."
"This relationship is fundamental, and forms the basis for all our policies since ultimately they are addressed to the citizens."
"It is therefore important that once a year Parliament, the Ombudsman and the Commission take stock of how this dimension is taken into account in their regular and day-to-day activities."
"However, this year the debate is different for two reasons."
"Firstly, work on the Convention is in full swing."
"It will map out the future of Europe, and both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman have referred to that body the issue of citizens' rights through proposals concerning, on the one hand, the right to petition, and on the other, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, an administrative law and means of appeal."
"Secondly, the Ombudsman, Mr Söderman, has told Parliament that he wishes to stand down at the end of March 2003, so this is the last time that he will present an annual report to this Assembly."
"Allow me to take this opportunity to thank Mr Söderman, on behalf of the Commission, for the work he has carried out since he was appointed in July 1995."
"As the first EU Ombudsman, he has played a pioneering role, helping to bring about a real change of culture within the Commission, and I am sure that this also applies to the other institutions and bodies."
"In addition, his own-initiative enquiries have also had direct consequences, and resulted in positive administrative reforms."
"I should like to mention some of them."
"Firstly, the Code of Good Administrative Conduct which, it should be stressed, was the result of an initiative by Parliament when adopting the Perry report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions in 1996."
"Then in the recruitment sphere, there have been firstly the removal, in two stages, of the age limit in competitions and, secondly, the Ombudsman's success in obtaining the right for any participant in a competition to have access to their corrected papers."
"Both these things required quite a change in administration and tradition in the institutions."
"Lastly, his efforts have prompted us to organise more structured relations between complainants and the Commission in infringement procedures."
"These are the areas in which the institutional relations between the Ombudsman - often supported by Parliament, moreover - and the Commission have led to genuine progress."
"I should like to return briefly to the Code of Good Administrative Conduct, because the reports by Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis raise this matter."
"It should be pointed out that from the outset the Commission was receptive to Parliament and the Ombudsman."
"It has drawn up various drafts starting in 1998 and now under the present Commission it has drawn up and adopted its own Code of Conduct aimed at the citizen, binding in nature and corresponding to many of the points in the Code of Conduct drawn up by the Ombudsman himself."
"This important work led the Commission to amend its own Rules of Procedure in October 2000."
"Not all the institutions have acted in that way."
"Of course there remain certain differences compared with the latter code, as the Ombudsman, Mr Perry, and now Mr Koukiadis and Mr Wyn have pointed out."
"Be that as it may, the Commission code represents real progress."
"Of all the codes adopted by the institutions, it is the one which corresponds the most closely to the Ombudsman's proposals."
"It entered into force in November 2000, and a first evaluation report has now been finalised. It will be circulated shortly."
"The Commission is well aware that, despite all its efforts, the European Ombudsman would like to go further."
"He has in fact referred this issue to Parliament in a special report, with the result that a year ago Parliament expressed itself in favour of a single harmonised code for all the institutions."
"This is still the position today of your rapporteurs, Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis"
"The Commission realises that the situation is not totally satisfactory at present since European citizens are confronted with different standards of good administration depending on which institutions they contact."
"However, the Commission is not in a position at present to launch a legislative initiative."
"The first report on the application of the Commission code covers only a few cases, as you will no doubt see, and we know nothing about how the other codes are being implemented by the other institutions."
"In addition, as I have just mentioned, discussions are in progress at the Convention concerning the adoption of an administrative law, and we should undoubtedly wait for its results."
"I notice in this connection that the proposal made by the Ombudsman to the Convention provides for the adoption of such a law within one year of the entry into force of the Treaty."
"It seems to me that this gives us some room for manoeuvre."
"Lastly, while it is true that an interinstitutional approach aimed at the adoption of a single code and a single law is no doubt useful, the fact remains that the situation in each institution is specific, and a degree of flexibility is called for."
"I will not go through all the points raised in the reports by Mr Koukiadis and Mr Wyn, but I must say that relations between the Ombudsman and the Commission, although cordial and very productive, may from time to time give rise to disagreements in the context of institutional relations."
"While the Commission pays tribute to the work accomplished by the Ombudsman, the fact remains that there are still differences of opinion on certain points."
"Firstly, there is the question of the application of the relevant provisions of Regulation 1049/2001 to infringement dossiers and how to interpret the data protection directive."
"However, I will not repeat here the position expressed on behalf of the Commission by Mr Bolkestein on this latter point or the opinion expressed by the Commission concerning the proposal to amend the rules governing the Ombudsman."
"Both Parliament and the Ombudsman are well aware of these positions."
"Nevertheless, I should like to return for a moment to the report by Mr Koukiadis on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions."
"The Commission shares the rapporteur's main concern of organising more efficient working and cooperation conditions between the Commission and the Committee on Petitions."
"Incidentally, as the President and some Members will know, I have personal experience of very well-organised cooperation with the committee in a specific case."
"Returning to the text, the prospect of enlargement should prompt us to improve our procedure still further and, in this connection, I would reiterate the Commission's willingness to debate a review of the interinstitutional agreement with the Council and Parliament on the examination of petitions."
"The Commission also agrees with the rapporteur about cooperation with the national parliaments and with the national administrations as part of the efforts to find solutions to problems raised by petitions."
"Allow me to conclude with a few points which should be made at this time of institutional deliberations."
"One of the objectives of the Convention is to bring the institutions closer to citizens."
"In this context, there can be no question of reducing the possibilities with regard to exercising the right of petition, but rather of consolidating them or providing a framework for them."
"In addition, it is clearly very important, as part of the clarification of the institutional system, that citizens should be aware of the various means of appeal available to them at the various levels of the institutional machinery."
"The Commission therefore welcomes the contributions by the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions, and undertakes to examine them constructively."
"Moreover, by adopting a constructive dialogue approach, the Commission, the Ombudsman and the European Parliament will make the best possible contribution to defending the interests of European citizens."
"Madam President, we are debating the last annual report which will be presented to the Parliament by Jacob Söderman."
"Today is not the time when we say farewell, but it is a moment to appreciate the work that Jacob Söderman has carried out and his efforts on our behalf and very much in the interests of Europe."
"The European Union institutions are inevitably a large and complex bureaucracy and, of course, there are going to be mistakes and administrative errors."
"The institutions seek to minimise those errors, and they must be prepared to listen to advice on how to do that."
"The Ombudsman is there, as we all know, to act as the arbiter in a fair and objective way."
"I would say to the Commission that they must think long and hard before they reject any of the Ombudsman's findings."
"I been appalled to come across examples where the Commission has blatantly rejected the Ombudsman's findings."
"Without going into details, I have a letter here from Mr Prodi to one of my colleagues."
"The Ombudsman found there had been maladministration and the Commission flatly refused to reverse the situation."
"Mr Prodi writes: 'I am convinced that the solution we offer is the most suitable in the light of the specificity of the case and I am disappointed that your constituent does not see it this way'."
"It is hardly surprising that the MEP concerned has written to me in the Committee on Petitions to say that the reply from the President of the Commission is preposterous."
"It is impossible to defend that before the citizens."
"I am sorry in some sense that it is Commissioner Liikanen who is here this morning."
"I always appreciate his words and certainly acknowledge the good relations between his department and the Committee on Petitions."
"I was very heartened to hear his words this morning about the Commission's preparedness to look at the review of the inter-institutional agreement."
"The time for that is certainly getting very close."
"I want to make stronger points about the Code of Administrative Behaviour."
"Last December, Commissioner Kinnock promised to this House that we would receive a review on the workings of the voluntary Code."
"We are yet to see it, although we have heard it will come in the near future."
"To my mind, it is already a year late."
"A code has to be binding, it must not be a voluntary code; and it also needs to be consistent."
"The citizens of Europe do not distinguish between the institutions of the European Union."
"To them, Brussels is one place, Strasbourg is somewhere else."
"They want a consistent code across each of the institutions."
"I have analysed the voluntary code of the Commission and compared it with that proposed by the Ombudsman."
"In over 70% of the articles, there are differences."
"Some differences may be small, but some are very big indeed."
"The Commission code does not explicitly recognise the need for courtesy."
"There is no provision for an apology or correction of mistakes."
"The Commission code is very weak on access to documents and on discrimination: it does not recognise that discrimination can be based on language, membership of a national minority or even appearance."
"The Commission's code says staff shall not be guided by personal interest."
"The Ombudsman's code says the official shall not take part in a decision in which he or she or any close member of his or her family has a financial interest."
"I would urge the Commission to be more relaxed about it, to listen to the code that is proposed by the Ombudsman and endorsed by this House, and to accept it."
"It should be in the forefront, it should not say: 'Well, none of the other institutions has done so'."
"I know that is the case."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is in the driving seat here and should be much readier to accept the advice, coming from friends, which will enable it to face the citizens of Europe much more confidently."
"I am delighted to say that the Committee on Petitions had a recent meeting with the Danish presidency at which the presidency expressed its willingness to look at the new interinstitutional agreement."
"We have the communication from the Commission on complaints and petitions, and we now have Mr Liikanen's proposals."
"The time has come for us to have that new interinstitutional agreement."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I join with Roy Perry in saying that we should not let this occasion pass without expressing our gratitude for the work of Jacob Söderman, the first Ombudsman of the European Union, and for the success with which it has been rewarded."
"I would also like to say that we can congratulate ourselves on having had the courage, in 1995, to entrust this great task to - if I may say so - a rather unknown representative of a new Member State."
"I would like to congratulate Jacob Söderman on having focused our attention on the essential matters, namely the total reform of the European institutions, in which secretive dealings of one sort or another gave way to the principle of openness and transparency."
"Above all, I also thank our Ombudsman for the very quiet, calm, but determined way in which he did his work."
"We know the examples, and that we could not take an easier way, but we see from the successes chalked up by the administrations in the EU's northern countries - Finland, Sweden and Denmark, which score lowest on the index of corruption - that there is no such alternative."
"I share the disappointment expressed earlier at the spectacle, over and over again, of the hesitancy manifested by the so-called Brussels bureaucracy."
"This is an area in which we need to press on."
"It was not least this opacity, this inability to identify what was going on, that brought down the European Union's last Commission."
"By touching on sore points, Mr Söderman has done the right thing."
"Let us recall the delayed payments."
"The Commission is one of the worst bodies in Europe when it comes to paying up, yet see the self-assurance with which it lays down rules for all economic actors, while itself being in fact incapable of making payments in a proper manner!"
"In the most simple terms, this is about bringing administration closer to the citizen."
"It is the experience of all of us, again and again, that the people back home talk about how big our bureaucracy is in Brussels."
"We know that it is a very small one, but it acts big."
"I have to say, as rapporteur for the Budget, that I am a little ashamed - although I am aware that it is mainly the fault of the Finance Ministers of the fifteen Member States - of our manifest inability to equip the European Ombudsman's office with the staff its importance warrants."
"We in Parliament are doing our best, and we will find a solution, but the finance ministers obviously think that enlargement is not actually in the offing and that the Ombudsman will not need extra staff."
"This really saddens me, and it is something I have to say in the hearing of many members of the public."
"Emphasis has been laid on the good cooperation between the Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions."
"It is Jacob Söderman's leadership that has given us the modern institution of a European Ombudsman."
"Now, perhaps, it is our responsibility, and that of the Committee on Petitions and of Parliament as a whole, to bring our activities up to a comparable standard."
"Madam President, the twin bodies of the Petitions Committee and the European Ombudsman form a key plank in bringing the European Union closer to its people."
"Much has been written about the democratic deficit and voter alienation in the European Union."
"As a directly elected representative of the people, I believe that we could go a long way to giving a more human face to the institutions of the European Union if we successfully promoted the work of these bodies to our constituents."
"Much has been achieved over the past year through the close cooperation of the Ombudsman and the committee."
"I would like to offer Mr Söderman my fullest congratulations on an outstanding tenure of office."
"He came to Strasbourg with already considerable experience in defending citizens' rights in his own country."
"Indeed the notion of an ombudsman is originally a Nordic one."
"There is no doubt that in areas such as openness, transparency and creating a public service that really serves the people, the European Union has benefited greatly from the Nordic perspective."
"Mr Söderman indicated to us some time ago that he would be stepping down early next year."
"He has done an outstanding job in establishing the role and function of the Ombudsman as the first person to hold this important post."
"Informing citizens about this important office naturally requires time and resources, and it is true that work remains to be done in increasing the profile of the European Ombudsman."
"Whoever Mr Söderman's replacement might be, and we are all aware that the selection process is already under way, he will have a lot to live up to."
"Mr Söderman has been most assiduous in executing his brief on behalf of the citizens of Europe."
"He has not hesitated to tackle the European Union institutions head on at the highest level if he felt it right to overturn the decision resulting from bad administration."
"I wish him well in his retirement and would like to assure him that if he is ever feeling depressed during the long, cold Finnish winters he would be most welcome to visit sunny Ireland."
"Madam President, great praise has been showered on Mr Söderman and also on the two rapporteurs, Mr Wyn and Mr Koukiadis."
"It is as a matter of principle that I wish to reiterate this, having read this great tome that comes out every year and found that he has achieved an enormous amount."
"It is lamentable that the Committee on Petitions is prevented from playing the part to which it might do justice by the excessive inadequacy of the resources with which it is equipped."
"The Committee on Petitions must be a real point of contact for citizens, but the Council should also take even more account of it."
"The Nice Treaty states that the European Union must be brought closer to its citizens."
"This might present an opportunity to do this at this level, and it is enormously important that the Ombudsman has offered to develop joint activities with local and regional ombudsmen and with committees on petitions."
"The European Union will always find it difficult to be recognised in the Member States as the servant of the people that it is meant to be."
"In particular, more attention needs to be paid to Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This is where it is enormously important that the Charter should become legally binding and be incorporated into the Treaties."
"If we do not manage to force this through, we will find the European Union's credibility hard to defend."
"Madam President, I am going to comment on the Koukiadis report."
"Hardly a year has passed since we debated the report on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions for 2001 - for which I was rapporteur - and I am pleased to note that the right of petition is increasingly strengthening the political control that the European Parliament can exercise in relation to excessive violations of Community law."
"This also allows us to assess the state of the application of that law within the Union and the degree of satisfaction amongst the citizens with the Community institutions, which are absolutely essential in a Union which is so large, so multi-faceted and sometimes so disconnected from those institutions."
"All of this is taken up superbly in the report by Mr Koukiadis which, furthermore, comes at an historic moment for the Convention, which should not sidestep - this would be a great mistake - the strengthening of the right to petition and the enlargement of a uniform administrative code of conduct."
"For all these reasons, we congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koukiadis."
"However, we once again regret - and this aspect is also taken up in the report we are debating - the lack of attention the Council is paying to this inalienable right of the European citizens, since the Council is still absent throughout the process, and this at a time when it is trying to gain more power for itself, to the detriment of Parliament and the Commission."
"Furthermore, we are delighted at the intention to introduce preventive measures to prevent abuses of cultural and environmental heritage - which, by the way, are issues which are at the forefront of the European citizens' concerns."
"I will end by insisting also that we should investigate procedures aimed at effectively remedying the national authorities' lack of willingness to cooperate with the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament."
"We must study them and implement them as soon as possible."
"We have had enough of the lukewarm positions of the Council and the national governments."
"As the rapporteur suggests and as has been proposed in corresponding reports in previous years, we should even go as far as to renounce, in press conferences, the obstructive and reticent attitudes of the governments to the resolutions of Parliament's Committee on Petitions."
"And I would also like to wish Jacob Söderman all the best for his Iberian retirement."
"Mr President, the report submitted by the Ombudsman demonstrates that this is an important and necessary post."
"We must safeguard the financial resources of the Ombudsman's office."
"This is something that is not always taken sufficiently seriously in Parliament's Committee on Budgets."
"I will use the same figure of speech the former Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko of the former Soviet Union used referring to the present Chairman of the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, Mikhail Gorbachov: the Ombudsman must have iron teeth."
"With regard to human resources management in the EU the Members of the Commission act as both prosecutors and judges."
"This is shown once again in the case of Martha Andreasen."
"It would be appropriate if the impartial Ombudsman were also to look into that person's punishment."
"The present system does not provide legal protection."
"It would also certainly be worth the Ombudsman's while to undertake an own-initiative enquiry and report with regard to the administrative practices of the European Central Bank."
"The bank's openness and the transparency of its administration represent the worst standards in the EU."
"It is regrettable that the Ombudsman in his annual report should have to state that the EU institutions have failed both to put the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice and implement the decision on the European Parliament's good administrative behaviour."
"The remarks about administrative discrimination on the grounds of age or gender are particularly regrettable."
"In the annual report there are 21 photographs of the Ombudsman, and in most of them he has a gentle expression on his face."
"When it is a matter of a departure from good administrative practice the friendly exterior should deceive nobody."
"Our Ombudsman acts fearlessly, like Jaakko Ilkka in the Finnish Cudgel War, against the tyranny of the administrative nobility."
"Mr President, I will not use up my two minutes to thank the Ombudsman - because it would be quite possible to do so - but instead I will focus attention on a matter raised in Mr Wynn's report."
"The Ombudsman has appealed to the Convention proposing that he should in some cases be able to refer violations of fundamental rights to the Court of Justice of the European Communities."
"This is a notion that should be taken seriously, because the Ombudsman seems to be the sole European institution that is really founded on the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"All the other institutions seem instead to be backsliding with regard to its demands, although it is the very institutions themselves these demands should be binding on."
"Secondly, I would like to raise a point made in the report drawn up by my colleague, Mr Koukiadis, which is absolutely crucial with regard to what Mr Kronberger said about strengthening the powers of the Committee on Petitions so that it could represent and defend the rights of citizens."
"Point 5 of Mr Koukiadis's report states the notion that the Treaties should provide the possibility for citizens to initiate reform of Community law by petitioning the European Parliament."
"I ardently support this view and believe that, as we are discussing opportunities for citizens to have an influence, we should at long last include citizens as participants in the decision-making process and not just as the subjects of that process."
"We might take an example from a country like Switzerland, where the people can indeed initiate the legislative process."
"I believe we need such initiatives if we want the public to accept that the European Union has jurisdiction over their lives."
"Mr President, the task of Ombudsman demands both great patience and considerable optimism in terms of getting the EU institutions to comply with basic demands concerning the Rule of Law and democratic accountability."
"Mr Söderman has carried out his task with infinite patience, particularly in regard to the Commission which has shown no understanding of elementary administrative culture."
"It is difficult to sustain optimism, however."
"I do not want to suggest that Mr Söderman has given up, but the fact that the EU's competent and patient Ombudsman has chosen to retire early is a signal that the Commission's absolute power is too overwhelming."
"Absolute power does not only result in passivity; it is revealed in the active opposition to the Ombudsman's efforts to introduce the Nordic countries' administrative culture into the institutions of the EU."
"A couple of examples: freedom of expression is practised as the freedom to employ several hundred million euro on spreading EU propaganda, in conjunction with the ruthless censorship of critical voices."
"One has only to read about the latest victim of the arrogance of power. Her name is Marta Andreasen."
"Data protection is used not to protect citizens' private lives but to secure the Commission's monopoly on knowledge."
"The Ombudsman's right to gather uncensored information is sabotaged outright by the Commission."
"I would take the liberty of referring to the Ombudsman's brilliant answer to the Commission's scandalous statement of 6 March of this year, a statement characterised by the Ombudsman in terms of the negative points of view and false assumptions it contained."
"There is a long way to go."
"With his latest report, Mr Söderman deserves a big thank-you for having tried to make the way shorter, but his departure gives new topicality to the issue of whether we shall ever reach the end of the road or only remain at the start of it."
"Is the EU system, characterised as it is by absolute power, simply resistant to the Rule of Law and democratic accountability?"
"There are an appallingly large number of witnesses to the fact that the answer might be in the affirmative."
"Mr President, Strasbourg has come to symbolise not only peace, but also human rights, civil liberties and parliamentary government."
"It was here, fifty-three years ago, that the Council of Europe was set up, and where it still has a special concern for human rights."
"It was here, fifty-two years ago, that the European Convention on Human Rights was adopted, our neighbour the European Court of Human Rights being its fruit."
"It was here, fifty years ago, that a European Parliament met for the first time."
"This week has found us observing its fiftieth anniversary."
"It was here too that we had our first joint session with the European Council's Parliamentary Assembly, which might well have been rather tricky in technical terms, but I must say that those responsible overcame the difficulties brilliantly."
"This was also a long-awaited opportunity to build stronger links between these two institutions, the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council."
"Strasbourg is also the seat of the European Ombudsman, who expresses our vision of a citizens' Europe, a Europe of human rights."
"It has already frequently been said that Brussels, being the home of the Commission and of the Council, is increasingly synonymous with bad administrative practice."
"I consider this rather unfair, and have to say so too, as Brussels is where the administration of the Council and the Commission does much that is exemplary."
"Indeed, the present Commission - and I have for some years been numbered among the great critics of the Commission - and Mr Liikanen as well, have done much to systematically improve its administrative practices."
"Despite that, there is still a staggering amount remaining to be done."
"Unlike Mrs Hautala, I do not believe that the introduction of more direct democracy will win the public over to European integration."
"What works outstandingly well in the small democratic structure that is the canton of Appenzell, will not work in the same way in a Community with half a billion inhabitants."
"The end result would be a society governed by hysteria, in which politics would be run by demagogues in television companies."
"What we need is decentralisation and the Rule of Law."
"A great deal has been said today about the Nordic culture."
"I welcome that."
"The Ombudsman is a Nordic invention, but we are not the Nordic community; we are the European Community."
"The concept of supranational law is a Roman achievement."
"That is why I was very glad to hear something Mr Gemelli said."
"'What is decisive,' he said, 'is that people are aware of their European citizenship.'"
"You can say it in Latin just as well: 'Civis europaeis sum.'"
"Only when people can say that will the unification of Europe have been achieved."
"That is why we need good administration, clear principles of human rights, and Europe as a Community based on the Rule of Law!"
"Mr President, I must also applaud the splendid work done by Mr Söderman as European Ombudsman."
"I also want, however, to emphasise that Mr Posselt and Mr Liikanen have made an important point."
"We must have institutions that fight for citizens' rights in the EU."
"We must have colleagues who show that they are in favour of securing citizens' rights, but that is not enough in itself."
"It is our task to ensure that citizens are also given resources to campaign themselves for their own rights."
"It is our task to guarantee that the individual is not powerless before the institutions of the EU."
"That, moreover, is precisely the job of the European Ombudsman."
"It is therefore also our task in the European Parliament to ensure that the Ombudsman is given the opportunities and the tools that make for the right working conditions, including access to documents and the opportunity of talking with employees and obtaining clear answers."
"I would urge the Danish Presidency to make efforts along these lines in order to ensure that the European Ombudsman is able to operate as intended."
"Mr President, may I too start by congratulating the European Ombudsman on what is indeed a valuable job extremely well done, before commenting on the excellent report by my honourable friend, Mr Koukiadis, and drawing the House's attention in particular to two points which, in my view, should be included in the Treaties on the occasion of the Convention."
"The first concerns point 17, calling for ways to be considered of persuading the national authorities to respond to petitions by citizens and questions asked by the Committee on Petitions and the Commission."
"We often encounter indifference or have to deal with obstructionism."
"The rapporteur and the Committee on Petitions unanimously adopted the following proposal which I had the honour of tabling: ""In the event of indifference or obstructionism on the part of the national authorities, the national media should be informed of this negative attitude and of the content of the petitioner's complaint."""
"As we all know, nothing affects or upsets national and local authorities more than their illegal acts or omissions or even their indifference towards their citizens being publicly exposed."
"This publicity could be achieved by issuing press releases in the language of the country in question and by organising press conferences in which national MEPs, especially the members of the Committee on Petitions, could participate."
"Secondly, I should like to point out that the Committee on Petitions receives huge numbers of petitions complaining about works planned or under way or conduct on the part of national authorities which violate mandatory Community rules, often resulting in irreparable damage to the environment or European cultural heritage."
"Proceedings resulting in convictions by the European Court are so time-consuming as to be useless, because the damage has already been done and cannot then be rectified."
"That is why I believe we should find ways of preventing damage pending a final decision by the European Court, where a petition has been referred to it."
"As you know, temporary prohibitory or mandatory injunctions can be issued under national legislation, preventing damaging activities from starting or continuing until a decision is taken on whether or not they are legal."
"This motion proposes something along similar lines and we should ardently support it."
"Otherwise, what happens if a natural habitat is destroyed, for example?"
"It cannot be restored."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by pointing out that the protection of the citizens and their rights is one of the fundamental principles of our democracies."
"I believe that if we safeguard the rights of the citizens and provide them with sufficient protection, we can also call upon them to discharge their responsibilities."
"In my opinion, this should be the main consideration."
"We must therefore consolidate these rights, and the way to do so is through the right of petition, which provides the individual citizen with the possibility of appealing to a dedicated body which can then carry out controls, whether it is the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions or the European Ombudsman."
"I greatly welcome the cooperation between the two institutions, which I feel has been an extremely positive development."
"The network is up and running and is constantly improving, and I therefore feel that access must be further facilitated."
"Improvement has been possible thanks to the use of new technologies, but I believe that access is facilitated when information on accessibility is distributed as widely as possible."
"Therefore, we still need to do much more in terms of disseminating information."
"It would be useful, for example, for all the publications issued by the European institutions for the public to read to contain, in future, a section on how to contact the Ombudsman and how to contact the Committee on Petitions, so that the individual citizens are provided with the possibility of receiving help at those times when they consider that the public administrations are not doing their duty and that their rights have been infringed, and to ensure that they are aware of the existence of this facility."
"This would help us to improve our structures because, in actual fact, if we are aware of real or alleged malfunctions, we will be able, not least as Members of the European Parliament, to take appropriate measures to address them."
"I will end on a very personal note."
"In 1995, Mr Söderman, I voted for the occupant of the office adjacent to mine, who was not yourself but Mr Siegbert Alber."
"It is therefore with even greater conviction that I thank you most sincerely for your work and for your efforts on behalf of the citizens."
"Thank you and good luck for the rest of your term of office."
"I too would like to thank Mr Söderman for all his work over the past few years."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0278/2002) by Mrs Boudjenah, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the European Parliament's recommendations to the Commission concerning the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements with the ACP countries and regions [2002/2097(INI)]."
"Madam President, the Commission appreciates and welcomes the strong interest the European Parliament takes in EU-ACP negotiations of economic partnership agreements, as witnessed by the report of the development committee by Mrs Boudjenah and the opinion of the industry and trade committee by Mr Titley."
"I would like to thank the honourable Members for their work."
"The European Parliament has also shown an impeccable sense of timing by tabling this report just before the launch of the EU-ACP negotiations on the economic partnership agreements tomorrow."
"From the Commission's point of view, the main strength of the report is that it puts ACP development at the centre of the EPA negotiations."
"This is exactly where the Commission wants it to be."
"EPAs shall be a tool for the smooth and gradual integration of ACP countries into the world economy, thereby promoting sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication."
"To this end, the ACP and the EU have decided to negotiate in a spirit of partnership the progressive removal of barriers to trade between them."
"The resulting agreements will extend to all areas relevant to trade, notably non-direct measures."
"The EPAs shall also be WTO-compatible and build on ACP regional integration initiatives as key instruments for ACP integration into the world economy."
"This is in a nutshell what was laid down in the ACP-EU agreement signed in Cotonou in June 2000, an agreement endorsed by the European Parliament."
"In Cotonou the ACP and the EU agreed to enter into EPA negotiations and laid down objectives, principles and modalities for these agreements."
"Some of the questions raised in the report had thus already been settled at the time of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The Commission refers, for instance, to those parts of the report which call for the continuation of non-reciprocal trade preferences for the ACP."
"Non-reciprocal preferences have not achieved, and cannot achieve, the closer integration of ACP countries into the world economy."
"A more comprehensive approach is needed aimed at enhancing ACP supply and trading capacities and the capacity to attract investment."
"This was the joint conclusion of the ACP states and the EU when negotiating the Cotonou Agreement, and that is why they agreed to conclude WTO-compatible trading arrangements to progressively remove all barriers to trade between them."
"Trade liberalisation on both sides is an indispensable element of this undertaking, provided it is not pursued blindly but flexibly."
"In short, our common objective is to use trade for development."
"Likewise, retention, consolidation and possible extension of the commodity protocols is not in line with the Cotonou Agreement, which says we will review these protocols."
"The Commission is of the opinion that we should not prejudge this review."
"Lastly, any decisions on alternatives to the EPAs under the Cotonou Agreement are only to be taken in 2004 should the EPA negotiations show that EPAs do not offer the appropriate solutions for specific cases in the countries concerned."
"The Commission agrees with the need, highlighted in the report, for analysis and assessment of the impact of the EPAs on sustainable development."
"This will require a thorough and sustained effort throughout the negotiations."
"The sustainability impact assessment foreseen in parallel with the negotiations is designed to achieve this goal."
"It will enable systematic analysis of the impact of the different policy options considered in the course of the EPA negotiations as they evolve, and will thus inform negotiators' choice."
"Its ongoing results should keep the negotiations on track towards genuine sustainable development."
"The Commission also supports ACP countries and regions that want to undertake their own studies."
"We have ensured that considerable amounts of money are available under national, regional, and all other ACP programmes not only for studies but for trade-related assistance and capacity-building more widely."
"Meanwhile the Commission is going ahead with the sustainability impact assessment and we will do so in full transparency with regard to the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the Committee on Industry in general welcomes the Commission's communication because the EPAs between the EU and different regions could reinforce economic cooperation between ACP countries and encourage their economic development."
"Therefore, we particularly welcome the Commission's proposal that treatment granted to the EU be extended to all ACP-EPA partners before trade liberalisation with the EU."
"This is particularly important."
"It is not going to be easy, and some of the reasons for that have been outlined."
"We have to proceed with caution and with flexibility."
"We must not put pressure on ACP countries to enter into negotiations they do not feel to be appropriate, and we must safeguard and respect the rights of LDCs to non-reciprocal trade preferences."
"We need, however, in particular, to encourage technical assistance to achieve institution building, which will allow balanced results."
"We need to ensure that we take into account the capacity constraints of the ACP countries and seek to build those as part of the process."
"We need to bear in mind that the abolition of tariffs could well cause a loss of public resources and, therefore, create budgetary problems."
"We must not lose sight of our objective in relation to the Cotonou Agreement of poverty eradication and sustainable development."
"Thus the Committee on Industry's position is very much to support the Commission's point of view and welcomes the fact that negotiations are going to start tomorrow but to ask that we proceed with sensitivity and caution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic partnership agreement with the ACP regions represents an attempt on the part of the European Union at putting future development cooperation with these states on a new basis, one with better prospects and greater likelihood of success."
"The intention is that greater economic exchange should combat poverty in the long term and eventually contribute to improving the earnings potential of people who live in the ACP States."
"By means of regional cooperation on their part, the ACP States are to be put in a position to develop their own functioning markets, which are necessary if there is to be greater trade with us in both goods and services."
"The mutual market opening, especially the opening of the great European internal market, is intended to enable them to achieve better sales in this market of their existing products, and perhaps also of those of higher quality yet to be developed, and thereby lay the foundations for the development of their national economies."
"As part of this, the EU is holding out the prospect of generous technical aid to equip the economic and administrative actors with better qualifications."
"The negotiations that are now getting underway should therefore focus on turning the ACP States into more effective economic partners, enabling social and cultural development, too, to be further accelerated."
"Mrs Boudjenah's own-initiative report would, I regret to say, need to be further substantially improved by the incorporation of various amendments if the European Union is to negotiate from a stronger position, rather than for that position to be weakened as it is at the moment."
"In the long term, we have to attempt to reach a realistic accommodation with the interests of the ACP States."
"There is little point in this if it involves what gleams through at various points in this report - attempts at levelling accusations at the Commission, which has, in recent months, stepped up dialogue with the ACP States and made proposals to them concerning their sustainable development, which have included technical aid."
"What matters is that the Commission, with our help, is pressing on with the creation of the new ACP economic area."
"Some better system must replace the outdated and inefficient system of preferences for certain imports."
"The rules both of the WTO and also the Cotonou Agreement should be applied, but with flexibility, and without their objectives being turned on their heads."
"In that respect, the position of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy - the Titley Report - is substantially in line with our way of thinking, but we demand that the opening of markets should - as provided for in the WTO rules and in the Cotonou Agreement - concentrate on goods and services."
"For example, there is no internal market common to both Europe and Africa, which is why there can be no generally free movement of workers either."
"Our demand is that liberalisation be handled flexibly, with transitional periods, but that liberalisation in important economic sectors should not be ruled out."
"It is also our view that investment must be well protected in order to prevent this leading to the economic standstill and retrogression now evident in policies in Zimbabwe and other countries."
"We have nothing against the EU providing technical assistance with assessing the impact of the establishment of free trade and economic regions in Africa, but we vigorously oppose the opening of negotiations being made dependent on this, which could lead to reform of relations between the EU and the ACP States being blocked for a long time."
"We do not want to develop alternative rules for our relations with the ACP States; we should abide by the WTO's rules and the rules of our own Cotonou Agreement, which should be applied flexibly and with transitional periods."
"We are therefore proposing amendments that, if accepted, will make it possible for us to support the report, failing which we will vote against it or abstain."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Boudjenah on this timely report."
"We in the PSE Group strongly align ourselves with her sentiments in relation to trade being a means to an end, not an end in itself."
"The end is development of the ACP economies and poverty reduction for the poorest people in those countries."
"One test of the Commission - I think Mr Liikanen was disingenuous in what he said this morning - is whether there is a genuine openness to alternatives."
"It was never part of the Cotonou Agreement that the proposal for alternatives to EPAs would be delayed to 2004 and I hope he will withdraw that point when the debate is closed."
"We also want to record strong agreement for what Mrs Boudjenah puts forward in terms of the need to advance the impact assessments so that we can genuinely see the impact of these negotiations."
"The Commission again, in relation to the sugar industry, and the 'Everything but arms' proposals of a year and two years ago has not got a particularly strong track record in relation to impartial impact assessments and trade matters."
"I have been selected as the nominee to chair the trade committee in the Joint Parliament Assembly between the EU and the ACP. We are very much looking forward to playing an active role in overseeing these trade negotiations and promoting their transparency."
"The Commissioner will agree that the Cape Town Declaration agreed by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly earlier this year gives us a strong opportunity for parliamentarians and civil society more generally to play a far greater role in the discussions that these crucial negotiations entail."
"We want to see CAP reform being discussed."
"The Commission is wrong there."
"There are difficult issues for the ACP that the Commission forced on to the agenda."
"There are difficult issues for the European side as well and what right do we have to prevent that being discussed?"
"Lastly, in relation to ACP-wide issues, the ACP want to establish some principles as a complete block."
"They do not want to be subject to divide and rule and only to discuss issues with their regional groups."
"If we believe in partnership in development then we should respect their wishes."
"Mr President, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur, Yasmine Boudjenah, on her thorough and timely work, which provides us today, on the eve of the opening of negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreements, with a high-quality report on a particularly important and topical issue."
"Incidentally, the content of this report - and I wish to emphasise that it was given unanimous approval in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, in contrast to what Mr Schwaiger appears to be saying - and the introductory words of the rapporteur herself make my intervention easier."
"I shall, therefore, restrict myself to discussing a few aspects of this complex issue."
"First, I wish to state the need not to play down, in order to fall in line with the WTO, a partnership that has already been around for decades and which I believe must be continued and focused particularly on one key objective: the development of our more than 70 partner countries and meeting the fundamental needs of their populations."
"This highlights another issue: the Economic Partnership Agreements laid down in the Cotonou Agreement and the trade dimension of this agreement as a whole cannot prevail and even less replace a form of cooperation that must encompass various other fields and which, as I understand it, must be extended and seek to achieve better results than in the past."
"Secondly, I wish to emphasise that I consider it crucial to ensure that total respect is given to the forms, timing and means of regional integration undertaken by these countries which, as we know, are not always easy or even obvious: and that it is necessary to pay special attention to the new development that is the recently constituted African Union."
"And, fundamentally, I think it is crucial to ensure that there is no deterioration in the positive situation represented by the current ACP group."
"Thirdly, and taking account of the disparity in levels of development between the two parties in the negotiations and, in particular, the well-known limitations in terms of the ACP countries' capacities, I wish to state that we must have studies on the predictable impacts of the new agreements on their various options and at various levels drafted and, if they are already drafted, presented as rapidly as possible, in addition to the fact that those limitations themselves reveal how crucial it is to ensure these countries special and differentiated treatment, which guarantees levels of protection able to ensure their development."
"Fourthly, a more specific issue, however, that I feel is important and which Mr Titley has already mentioned: I am referring to the fact that customs revenues represent a substantial, if not almost exclusive contribution to the ACP countries' budgets, which means that the measures we adopt on trade liberalisation must take account of this extremely important fact."
"Mr President, I am pleased to participate in this debate on the economic partnership agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific nations."
"I would like to commend the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"It is important that these economic partnership agreements contribute towards placing the ACP countries in a position where they can be progressively integrated into the world economy."
"Building capacity both in the public and private sectors, enhancing production and conforming with the WTO provisions should lead to increased investment in developing countries, in particular external investment and expanding economies."
"We all hope for a successful negotiating process, which is due to be launched at an all-ACP level within the next couple of days."
"On the key question of market access, we must move towards improved access to EU markets for exports from developing countries, so as to ensure that negotiating proposals take account of the economic interests of all parties."
"I would urge the Commission to carry out an impact assessment of all the proposals."
"I would also urge the Commission in its negotiations to strongly promote the importance of increased assistance for trade-capacity building."
"I would, however, like to take issue with the rapporteur's insistence that a reform of the common agricultural policy is a necessary part of the process of integrating the developing countries into the world trading system."
"Issues surrounding the external effects of the CAP will be dealt with in the context of the Doha round of the World Trade Organisation talks."
"European farmers have had a very turbulent few years, following on from the BSE and foot-and-mouth crisis."
"There was a major reform of the CAP with Agenda 2000, and we are now faced with review proposals that will profoundly disrupt our production and our markets if carried through."
"Stability is needed, and suggestions that a new reform is necessary will only bring about more uncertainty."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Boudjenah on this successful report which highlights as something positive the fact that the Commission wishes to introduce a free-trade area between the EU and the ACP countries."
"Customs barriers are not, however, the most important problem for the ACP countries."
"Instead, this is, as several other fellow MEPs have also pointed out, the EU's heavily subsidised agricultural exports."
"To give just one simple example, it costs Europe slightly less than EUR 700 to produce a tonne of sugar, but it costs only a little under EUR 300 to do so in many African countries."
"Simple economic theory therefore tells us that African countries would have a superior position in the sugar market and that opening up the markets would be the route to growth."
"Because of the EU's export subsidies, the conclusion is not, however, quite so simple because the EU backs up European exports to the tune of EUR 1 104 million so that European farmers are able to sell their sugar much more cheaply than the developing countries."
"Nor, of course, will the situation change through the ACP countries' developing internal markets."
"It has been said before, but it cannot be repeated too often: the EU is not a credible partner as long as we retain the agricultural subsidies."
"They stand in the way of any development and of any fight against poverty."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome this report and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, particularly in expressing so clearly Parliament's understanding that trade is only a means to an end, and that end is sustainable development."
"All too often, in these institutions, there is a massive incoherence between European trade policy on one hand, and European development policy on the other, with trade concerns all too often undermining development objectives."
"With this report Parliament sends a very clear message that development concerns must come first."
"There are some key points I would like to underline."
"First, capacity."
"It simply beggars belief that some of the poorest ACP countries can possibly have the financial and technical resources to pursue the WTO's Doha agenda, the GATT's agenda, the NEPAD or FTAA agenda, at the same time as the EU economic partnerships agenda; and still at the same time still somehow pursue their own regional integration processes."
"Yet it is these very regional integration processes that the Commission says that it wants to support."
"We must get away from externally imposed timetables of which countries need to adopt new arrangements, and instead allow them to adapt at their own speed, according to their own development needs, just as the industrialised countries were able to do."
"Finally, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of waiting until we have the results of the impact assessments of these proposed economic arrangements."
"These must be conducted with the full participation of local people and we must have the results of those impact assessments before negotiations start."
"If necessary, we should be prepared to delay negotiations until we have them."
"Only in that way, can we be sure that the initiative will genuinely contribute to poverty eradication and sustainable development."
"Mr President, this report is on the face of it well-intentioned and recognises the need for ACP countries to export their goods."
"There are many fine phrases such as: 'worldwide inequality must be remedied'."
"But, as ever, it is all hot air and naïve idealism."
"In fact, what really strikes me here is the large element of sheer hypocrisy."
"Agricultural produce is a large element of ACP exports."
"Yet, despite all the fine words, the tariff regime makes the EU a difficult market-place, with 16% being a fairly typical entry price for ACP goods."
"It also means that consumers pay far too much for food here."
"Of course, the solution to all of this - real reform of the common agricultural policy - is nothing more than a mirage."
"How can we even talk about partnership agreements with these countries, given the continuing scandal of the European Union fisheries deals?"
"This Parliament continues to give its overwhelming endorsement to deals that involve huge sums of taxpayers' money going straight to corrupt African regimes: up to EUR 1.4 billion in the last few years alone, and little or none of it going to the local communities that need it."
"As a result of all of this, hundreds of indigenous black African fisherman are continuing to die."
"I have raised this point here before, and I am met with aggression from the Spanish and with indifference from Commissioner Fischler."
"To satisfy the greed of large companies in Europe, this place turns a blind eye to a humanitarian disaster."
"I do not expect many people here to agree with my view about political integration in the European Union. On this one area of fisheries deals, please surprise me and let us see some reform and let us give these struggling African coastal communities some sort of chance."
"Since 1994 there has been repeated documentary evidence about all this and it is high time that something was done."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment to paragraph 5, the last sentence of which reads: ""considers in consequence that signing such an agreement is incompatible with membership of the European Union""."
"I would very much like the word ""signing"" to be replaced by the word ""ratification""."
"That makes it much clearer and also means that the States that have signed still have a chance to refrain from ratification."
"That is why I would prefer the word ""ratification"" instead of ""signing""."
"Mr President, as you have very rightly said, the current situation in the Middle East has led my group to withdraw Amendments Nos 10 and 11, which were tabled on another basis and at a time when we were more optimistic."
"Instead, we want to bring in an oral amendment to insert the following after paragraph 4:"
"Mr President, I would like to add to Mr von Wogau's amendment an oral supplementary amendment which reads: ""this is to be in the form of a protocol to the constitution, and adherence to this protocol shall be a matter for the sovereign competence of each Member State."""
"Mr President, as we, in this Parliament, tend less towards the intergovernmental side, I would replace the word ""Council"" here by ""Commission""."
"I would, by the way, like to congratulate Mr van Orden, by dint of whose initiative Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union is to be incorporated into the constitution in its entirety, without any derogation!"
"I have voted in favour of this report, firstly because I believe that the role of the European Ombudsman is of enormous importance, especially considering the increasing distance, in decision-making processes, between the institutional bodies of the EU and the citizens of the Member States."
"Secondly, I wished to pay tribute the outstanding work of the outgoing Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman."
"Thirdly, because I support some of its most striking guidelines, specifically its call for the principles enshrined in the EU's Code of Good Administrative Behaviour always to be applied and for the institutions to strictly apply Regulation 1049/2001/EC on public access to the documents of the European institutions."
"Nevertheless, I feel bound to severely criticise the attempts made, also here, once again, to give what is known as the Charter of Fundamental Rights jurisdiction 'by force?, in a move that can only be seen as an attack on the Rule of Law and on European democracy - if the IGC, the only body that has competence in this matter, has not taken such action, because it did not see fit, no Community organ, court or body has the right to do so, at the risk of seriously contravening the law."
"I have decided to support this report and its motion for a resolution bearing in mind, specifically, some points that I wish to highlight: its request to the European Convention to also look into consolidating the right of petition; its call for the adoption of new data-processing tools enabling petitioners to follow the processing of their own and other petitions over the Internet, its criticism of the lack of enthusiasm in the Council for cooperation with the Committee on Petitions; and also its call for petitions to be studied and processed more rapidly."
"I believe that petitions could become an important tool for the exercise of citizenship and the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of persons and institutions and I find the idea put forward by the rapporteur that it could be possible 'for citizens to initiate reform of Community law through petitioning the European Parliament? extremely interesting."
"Mr President, the British Conservatives support the thrust of this directive."
"New engines with lean-burn or common-rail technology need low-sulphur fuels as a technology enabler to allow advanced catalytic converters to function."
"It is a mistake, however, to extend this to non-road mobile machinery, for example, tractors and construction equipment."
"These are not fitted with catalytic converters yet, and so do not need this type of fuel."
"In fact, more CO2 will be produced at the refinery by additional processing."
"Fuel costs will go up by at least 10% - another burden for hard-pressed farmers to carry at a time when they can least take it."
"We are very disappointed that Amendments 10 and 13 were passed by Parliament."
"For Portugal, and more precisely for the tourist region of the Algarve, recreational craft are a daily reality."
"It is in this context that I wish to express my unconditional support for the rapporteur, Mr Callanan and for the Commission proposal that seeks to make recreational craft more compatible with environmental standards in force, particularly exhaust emissions and engine noise, which damage both the environment of the region and the well-being of its holidaymakers."
"Making existing craft compliant with legislation will involve substantial costs that cannot be either disproportionate for boat owners or the sole responsibility of the shipbuilding industry."
"I therefore also consider the obligation for annual craft inspections to be unnecessary."
". (DE) As a German and Bavarian Member of the European Parliament, I am sorely disappointed by the outcome of this vote."
"On behalf of my honourable friends in the CSU, with whom I voted for more stringent limit values, I must say quite emphatically that an opportunity to limit water pollution from recreational craft has been missed for many years to come."
"Unfortunately, it is our impression that recreational craft engine manufacturers are deliberately holding back on modern engineering - we have an example of this in Switzerland - so as to be able to argue as the rapporteur has done."
"It should be a cause of concern to anyone who supports motor-boat and sailing sports, knowing that more and more people enjoy these sports and leisure activities, that they are practised in as environmentally-friendly a manner as possible."
"This dubious outcome in plenary today is certainly nothing to write home about."
". (DE) The dismantling of agricultural export incentives and barriers to food exports from developing countries mean that the countries in the south can take their rightful place in world trade."
"However, the interplay between trade, environmental pollution and development which results from EU agricultural policy is often overestimated."
"Disturbances on agricultural markets affect few products and should therefore be examined for any effect on lasting development."
"We need to act by pushing ahead on so-called non-trade related concerns during WTO negotiations."
"The WTO should stop evading the issues of consumer protection, the environment and animal protection standards."
"This includes implementing the development work of the 15 EU Member States, as formulated on more than one occasion."
"The decisions taken in Doha (on trade) and Monterrey (on finance) should be examined in detail immediately."
"Now that the Summit is over, the vital work of ensuring sustainable development has to continue."
"Johannesburg did not achieve everything, but there has been genuine progress nonetheless."
"I believe that the Summit will make a significant difference in key areas such as water and energy."
"The only way to deal with these issues is through common action at a global level."
"In the EU, we know how much more we can achieve by pooling our resources and setting common standards and by tackling together environmental problems which have cross-border implications."
"We can be proud that the EU played a crucial role in Johannesburg, presenting a very ambitious sustainable development agenda."
"Without the EU's efforts, I do not think the Summit would have made as much progress."
"The Summit was unable to achieve a satisfactory outcome on a target for increasing the share of renewable energy in global energy production."
"This is essential if we are all to meet our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol."
"Even if some countries in the developed world are not pulling their weight on this score, I believe that the EU and other like-minded countries should, nevertheless, work for more ambitious action in this area."
"The EU may make grandiose statements, but the pitiful outcome confirms that Johannesburg was nothing more than a meeting steeped in hypocrisy and crocodile tears between the countries of the so-called developed world on the misery which their capitalist interests have imposed on the third world."
"Unfortunately, the European Parliament resolution, for all its wishful thinking and ""sensitivity"", is merely a mouthpiece for the same hypocrisy."
"It is infuriating to hear claims that capitalist globalisation will work to the benefit of poor countries, given that the unrelenting terms on which international capitalist trade is conducted do absolutely nothing to improve the life of the people on this planet."
"Not a word on the foreign debt which brings developing countries to their knees or the responsibilities of the multinationals; just disgracefully hypocritical self-satisfaction when the same multinationals are called on to demonstrate ""sensitivity""!"
"The claim that subsidies for agricultural produce in the EU are responsible for the underdevelopment of the third world and should therefore gradually be abolished has been swallowed hook, line and sinker in a frenzy of hypocrisy."
"The same wishful thinking, the same begging for ""sensitivity"" and no progress on applying the Kyoto Protocol, while the capitalist world, and especially the USA, turns a provokingly blind eye to impending catastrophe."
"We shall vote against the resolution in protest against those paving the way for even greater exploitation of the masses."
"The aggressive stand taken by the Americans on the International Criminal Court is the product of its warmongering, imperialist plans."
"It is perfectly consistent with its general attitude towards the UN which, when it has trouble getting it to fall in with its plans, it ignores completely."
"Thus, having adopted a bill granting immunity to American personnel, even if they commit war crimes or genocide, it is now coercing various countries into signing bilateral agreements containing immunity clauses."
"Just what is the so-called international community doing in the face of this galling provocation?"
"The UN has rushed in to satisfy the Americans by granting them immunity for their crimes for at least a year and by excluding the crime of attack from the jurisdiction of the ICC."
"The ?U remains firmly pro-Atlantic, refusing to take a stand on the rushed plans for war against Iraq, one member (England) is actively involved in preparing for war and 3 other Member States have come out openly in favour of war, with no reaction whatsoever on the part of the ?U."
"In view of the foregoing, as members of the Communist Party of Greece, we consider that the ?U's interest in the ICC, as expressed in the resolution put to the vote, is hypocritical and is just part of the game of standoff between the imperialist powers as they squabble over the spoils and we shall not be voting in favour of it."
"I voted against this resolution solely because I do not think that the European Parliament, which is not a signatory to the Statute of Rome, has competence to interpret any of the provisions of this Statute, specifically the provision that has enabled the USA to hold negotiations and conclude agreements with some of the States that are signatories to it."
"I am also profoundly disappointed at the position adopted by this Parliament of implicitly threatening the countries that are candidates for accession, and others that benefit from financial aid under agreements and partnerships established with the EU, so that they abstain from adopting positions, in the context of their legitimate external policies, that are not in line with the EP's unilateral interpretation of Article 98 of the Statute establishing the ICC."
"This aim of this explanation of vote is also to point out that one of the countries covered by this resolution is East Timor, which would not have survived as an independent State without massive external military aid against the invader, aid that we doubt would have been made available if, at the time, the position adopted in this resolution had prevailed."
". (FR) The joint resolution states that 'the EU is the main trading partner and the leading investor in the countries of Mercosur?."
"We should take a further look at these investments."
"They are directly related to liberal policies of structural adjustments."
"For example, French companies such as EDF, Suez Lyonnaise or France Telecom have taken advantage of the wave of privatisations of public services in order to enter into these 'markets' with the sole aim of making profits."
"That is translated into redundancies for workers and increases in charges for users."
"The last straw is that a company such as Edenor in Argentina, the main subsidiary of EDF, is today asking the government to renegotiate its debt as well as an agreement to increase its charges!"
"Privatising profits and nationalising losses, that is what the 'Union's strategic and supportive commitment to the countries of Mercosur in relation to their economic and political integration projects?, which the policy praises, really looks like!"
"Mass redundancies, insecurity, unemployment, poverty, the dismantling of public services; that is what the IMF policy which the countries of Mercosur have implemented means."
"For our part, we reaffirm our complete solidarity with popular movements developing in these countries, Argentina in particular."
"The first minimal measure Europe could take would be the complete cancellation of the debt of the Mercosur countries."
"Since none of this appears in the resolution, I have voted against it."
"Mr President, my group has voted, with good reason, for the whole of Amendment No 3 to the Brok report, including the section in which Parliament urges Iraq to implement all relevant Security Council resolutions to avoid the implementation of these resolutions having to be enforced."
"The resolution links this to a statement by the Security Council about the result of the inspections."
"As I highlighted in my contribution to yesterday's debate, the ELDR Group too is of the opinion that explicit permission from the Security Council is required for military action."
"This is, in fact, how the ELDR's entire amendment should be interpreted."
"In general, we believe that Mr Brok's report is sound."
"We do not however agree with certain points in it."
"Paragraph 11: For reasons of efficiency and to increase the likelihood of the EU's speaking with one voice, we are, like the report, well disposed towards merging the tasks of the High Representative and those of the Commissioner for External Relations."
"On the other hand, we are not prepared at this stage to state in which institution this merged office is to be set up."
"At all events, the Common Foreign and Security Policy is an intergovernmental matter."
"Paragraph 14: We are in favour of the rule enabling the Member States to act within the framework of enhanced cooperation, but it should not be possible to apply this rule in matters of security and defence policy."
"Paragraph 20: The report should not encourage the Member States to increase their defence budgets."
"Paragraph 23: We do not agree that Article 28 of the Treaty should be changed so that the costs of military operations within the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy can be funded from the Community budget."
"Paragraph 26: We do not oppose closer institutional relations between NATO and the EU as a prerequisite for the EU's actually being able to carry out military operations relating to crisis management, but we wish however to draw attention to our view that any military intervention must be preceded by an appropriate UN mandate."
". (FR) In relation to the institutional organisation of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP), the Brok report is typical of the European Parliament's traditional positions: it pushes the CFSP as far as possible towards communitarisation, in particular calling for 'a common, though not single, European diplomacy? (paragraph 12), qualified majority voting in the Council (paragraph 14) and the transfer of the post of High Representative for the CFSP to the Commission (paragraph 11)."
"These proposals are the result of a desire to impose on Europe an abstract concept of a federal State, and not a considered understanding of practical realities."
"The common foreign and security policy cannot draw its strength from artificial Community procedures."
"It can only draw its strength, if necessary, from the support of the nations."
"It must therefore be based on those nations, which means: maintaining the coordinating role of the Council; unanimous decision-making, or otherwise variable geometry; the instruments must fall within the responsibility of the Council and not of the Commission."
"If the Convention meeting under the presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing wants to be effective, it must remain lucid by resisting federalist bombardment."
"In broad terms, the report on the CFSP is part of the approach extending its communitarisation and the militarisation of the European Union, implementing a Common Security and Defence Policy - as the European pillar of NATO, within the framework of our partnership with the USA."
"Amongst various troublesome aspects, I feel bound to highlight the 'ambiguous? and supposedly 'neutral? way in which the current situation on the Middle East is addressed, glossing over the Israeli Government's considerable responsibility for the intolerable situation that exists in Palestine, due to its policy of terror and violence against the Palestinian people and their representatives, its illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories and its failure to comply with UN resolutions."
"Equally negative is the position adopted by the current Danish Presidency which, in the debate held in this plenary, did not condemn the Israeli Government for the unacceptable siege imposed on the Palestinian National Authority and the blackmail practised against President Yasser Arafat, and did not call for an end to it and the immediate withdrawal of the Israeli army."
"I also feel that the failure to adopt the amendments tabled by my group seeking to reject any military aggression against Iraq, to lift the embargo on that country and to promote negotiations between Iraq and the UN to find a solution to the current situation is a mistake."
"Hence our vote against."
"The report on progress with the CFSP is being debated to the sound of war drums beating on the other side of the Atlantic."
"The USA has stated that it is determined to proceed with its attack on Iraq, its aim being to control the oil supply in the area and impose its supremacy."
"The report points the way for ?U action: closer collaboration with the USA and stronger trans-Atlantic relations."
"Greater militarisation of ?U institutions, more military spending by Member States, military action to prevent and manage crises."
"Alliances under the umbrella of ???? and the orders of the USA in order to silence the people and anyone who gets in the way of their imperialist interests."
"The EU's imperialist policy has already shown its face in Bosnia, Serbia, Afghanistan and elsewhere."
"The objections expressed so far to the EU's again becoming involved in an attack on Iraq are objections by imperialist interests and hence objections to the unilateral nature of the action by the USA rather than the war itself."
"We are worried that the ?U is prepared to take part in this dirty imperialist war if it is promised a share of the spoils."
"We say no to war."
"We want peace, de-escalation and disarmament."
"We are fighting alongside the people of Europe to put a stop to more imperialist wars."
"The Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the Brok report."
"(NL) In the Netherlands, my party, the Socialist Party, supports the initiative launched by a large number of peace and development organisations to institute an arms embargo against Israel by means of a temporary injunction."
"This is in the light of the ever-increasing violation of human rights by the Israeli army in the occupied Palestinian territories and the destruction caused there."
"Parliament's resolution on the third annual report with regard to the code of conduct on arms exports is founded on the assumption that the EU's external policy is guided by values of democracy and human rights, and that arms exports may not worsen the region's instability."
"Moreover, a majority voted today for the amendment in which military-industrial relations with conflicting parties in the Middle East are condemned."
"Meanwhile, the Dutch Schiphol airport remains the link and focal point of the arms trade between the USA and Israel."
"This is bound to cause enormous bitterness amongst the victims and also further instability in the region."
"The systematic oppression of the Palestinians gives every reason to refuse licences for the export of arms within the framework of the European code of conduct."
"I call on the Commission to help put an end to the escalation of violence and to support actions by citizens against Israeli violence in the Palestinian territories as a matter of urgency."
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, we are absolutely astounded that the Commission has tabled a proposal to water down the stability criteria without first agreeing the matter with the European Parliament in the relevant committees."
"I would ask that we debate this Commission proposal as quickly and efficiently as possible here in Parliament, because the current position does not, I think, have the support of this House."
"Your proposal will, of course, have to be laid before the Conference of Presidents, which I am afraid took place this morning instead of on Thursday afternoon as usual."
"If you had made the proposal this morning, we might have been able to persuade the Conference of Presidents to examine it in today's meeting but, in any case, it will be recorded in the Minutes and will be examined so that the point can be included in the agenda of one of the forthcoming part-sessions of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I must stand up for my honourable friend."
"He could not have raised it this morning, because the Minutes are not approved until the afternoon."
"But I wanted to say something quite different."
"As you can see from yesterday's Minutes, there was no Question Time and yet the sitting ended at 10.20 p.m., i.e. considerably earlier than planned."
"So there would have been time enough for Question Time."
"I know you will probably say that the decision would have been taken by the Conference of Presidents, but the Bureau - and I should like to ask you to convey as much to the Bureau - is responsible for keeping to the Rules of Procedure. And it states quite clearly in the Rules of Procedure that there must be one Question Time during each of the twelve plenary sessions in Strasbourg - at least that is how I understand it."
"That is a parliamentary right and it is non-negotiable."
"Hence, cancelling Question Time to the Council and Commission this week was, in my eyes, both an infringement of our fundamental parliamentary rights and an infringement of the Rules of Procedure, despite the fact that there was time enough."
"This afternoon we have just one more debate."
"So we could easily have held a topical and urgent debate this afternoon, but that too has been cancelled."
"There has been a coup in the Côte d'Ivoire."
"We are due to debate it on 9 October, when it will already be history."
"I urge you to organise Parliament's work differently from the way in which it has been organised this afternoon and this week."
"I feel that your comment should be relayed to the President - I will bring the matter before the President as a first port of call rather than referring it to the Conference of Presidents - so that it receives careful consideration."
"It is true that we usually follow the practice you have described of holding one part-session per month, and this month there have been two part-sessions."
"In any case, I feel that your comment is well-founded and that there needs to be reflection on the matter, on the part of our President first of all."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"The next item is the oral question (O-0040/02- B5-0254/02) by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, to the Commission on the action taken by the Commission on the MHP (Multimedia Home Platform)."
"Mr President, Mr Posselt may have plenty of time, but I have to leave as I am booked on a flight departing from Frankfurt at 3.30 p.m."
"Tomorrow I shall be speaking at a conference in Greece on this very subject."
"I apologise in advance to the Commissioner, and I will be much briefer than the chairman of our committee might have been, had he been here."
"Normally our colleague Mrs Junker would have replaced him, but she has been unwell and in hospital."
"I am sure the House would wish her well and a speedy recovery."
"I must declare an interest as a director of a television company that will certainly be involved in digital broadcasting and the broadband communication field - though probably long after I have ceased to have any connection with it."
"Would the Commissioner like me to repeat Mr Rocard's question?"
"And will the Commissioner be replying to the debate as a whole at the end?"
"The Commissioner is scheduled to speak immediately after your speech, Mr Whitehead."
"Mr President, I would like to say a few words about the reason for this question and for its urgency."
"Essentially it concerns the pace at which we will be able to open a full and proper debate on the standards for a single MHP, were we to have one."
"The Commissioner will, I think, be saying in his reply today when the necessary standards are going to be introduced and published."
"The reason for the urgency is that this subject also relates very much to the ongoing debate about media concentration and to development in the field of broadband communications, particularly in the light of what is happening in television and broadcasting at the moment."
"In my own Member State we have had ambitious plans, aiming to have the most competitive broadband system in the developed world by 2005."
"However, there have been stumbles along the way to the intended creation of a real competitive market for digital broadcasting and towards a measured advanced analogue switch-off."
"That serves as a warning to many of us - certainly those in the Committee on Culture, which is unanimous in the view that I am expressing - that the consumer and the citizen need to benefit from an open and wide debate, taking some account of the problems we have had in past attempts at regulation, as well as of those that we face now."
"There need to be clear markers on the ways in which a system of non-discriminatory interconnection and oversight of the gateways of broadband broadcasting and other systems can be operated in the public interest."
"I am painfully aware of the fact that one of the first attempts to set standards for early satellite broadcasting came adrift because the most powerful broadcasters in the field at the time - and they are still there today, but stronger and more powerful - deliberately decided to bypass these standards and to go their own way."
"With effective use of the market and less advanced technology, they were able effectively to end that first attempt at common standards."
"We do not want to make that mistake again, and I believe that in this situation we want to know how we are proceeding."
"I would ask the Commissioner to indicate how the European Union as a whole can take an active role, so that the operators of APIs are encouraged and helped to come together."
"He must know of the suspicions in this regard and precisely where they originate."
"The APIs are likely to be repeating in some ways what happened in the debate about conditional access and the gateways for satellite broadcasting."
"Many - particularly in my country would say that you do not need to have a single mandated standard, and that it would be better to encourage the APIs to come together."
"For the sceptics who believe that it would be very much against some of their interests to do so, and it has to be acknowledged that we would then be gambling everything on a strategy which some of the big operators, once again, would not want to cooperate with."
"How would the Commissioner square the need for competition that guarantees plurality with the technical advances which - according to those who operate it and profit by it - will come from the unregulated market?"
"I do not believe that we can take this matter further without a proper consideration not just of the technical debate but also of the way in which monopolies are currently developing."
"Mr Rocard's questions, I hope, will take the debate further and I will at least be able to listen to the Commissioner in the time available to me."
"I do apologise again for the fact that I have to leave before the conclusion of this debate, which I am taking part in, as you can see, at very short notice."
"We would like to join you, Mr Whitehead, in wishing Mrs Junker a speedy recovery."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed reply to the question put by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has been considering how we can find a way of guaranteeing a free flow of information and freedom of choice for viewers in the digital era."
"How can we achieve this objective?"
"No further debate is needed, we held our debate when we passed a resolution on the telecommunications package and, more particularly, on the framework directive."
"Today, and this is why we asked the question, we wanted the Commission to tell us what it can do to help implement the resolutions we passed then."
"And I am grateful because I think the Commission's statements have pointed to a constructive way forward here."
"However, I should like to reiterate that we have three basic resolutions."
"First, open interfaces, so-called APIs are not enough; these open interfaces need to be widely accessible, i.e. they must be interoperable."
"That is the objective we decided on together in the framework directive."
"Secondly, we decided that the Member States should promote the introduction of interoperable technology."
"Thirdly, we decided that we had until July 2004 for this voluntary procedure."
"Parliament is pushing for action in order to bring about a voluntary, user-friendly solution which also guarantees real freedom of choice and pluralism."
"For that, as you announced today, Commissioner, we need the technology, the standards which meet these requirements, to be published."
"There is a standard which has already been licensed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, which is responsible for the standards, namely MHP, which is why Parliament's demand is perfectly clear in the resolution we are voting on today."
"What we want to do is promote the technology that incontrovertibly meets the requirements."
"Hence the demand and the call in the resolution for the Member States to submit an action plan as quickly as possible - we are saying by the end of this year - as to how this objective can be achieved, so that we have real results by July 2004."
"So, as you see - and my thanks here to all my honourable friends in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy who helped here - we refer to the resolution and voluntary implementation of this resolution, but in the time specified and for the purpose specified."
"That is the point of this resolution."
"We trust that we have the agreement and support of the Commission and the Member States, in the interest of our citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your statements today; for us they are a really important step forward in the joint voluntary procedure, as Ruth Hieronymi has pointed out."
"We have not raised the question of comprehensive interoperability in the telecommunications directive, but we know that it is of huge importance to Europe, which sets standards in media policy."
"The Commission and the regulators, like the European Parliament, were not perhaps decisive enough in the early days."
"But we are now, because time is running out."
"The summer of 2004 will be here before we know it."
"Let us call it guidance that we need in this voluntary procedure; what our institutions are waiting for and what we are jointly calling for is a clear media policy message."
"We have mentioned a single standard."
"We have consistently avoided the word simple."
"We do not want to jump the gun."
"But this is not jumping the gun, it is being logical."
"As my honourable friend, Mrs Hieronymi said, we could have set one standard that speaks this common language, a single language, in the MHP."
"We need more clear political signals here."
"We opted for a single system for mobile telephones and we should do the same here and now."
"Before the industry invests any more and we have various other APIs which cannot talk to each other as we would like, because the more economic facts, figures and data there are on the table, the harder it will be for politicians to intervene directly here."
"This common voluntary procedure needs clear signals from us."
"Again I read a quotation in a technical journal recently in which you pointed out that the Commission can lay down binding European standards here if appropriate freedom of choice for our citizens and interoperability are not achieved by 2004."
"I do not think it will come to that."
"We should be able to find a joint solution before then."
"We need to meet each other half way."
"A large majority of market players are in favour of MHP and we should say so clearly."
"I think that is the answer expected of us."
"Mr President, I am very pleased to be participating in this debate, not as a member of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport but as one of the rapporteurs on the electronic communications package and a member both of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I should just like to say to colleagues from the Committee on Culture who are present that this is not an issue for that committee alone."
"It would be good if they encouraged more participation in their work within Parliament."
"This question was developed entirely within their committee."
"I am glad to have been able to work with many colleagues and to make a contribution."
"However, there is a much wider range of issues at stake here."
"Firstly, I sense a perception that this whole idea about a multimedia home platform (MHP) is somehow a silver bullet, a magic cure that will, in one sweep, create universal accessibility for digital television."
"Mrs Echerer gave us a hint of that just now."
"That is far from the reality."
"It is not like mobile telephony; it is not like introducing a GSM standard, because we already have digital television systems in the market, delivering services that consumers want to quite a high interactive standard."
"In my own country nine million people already have systems operating under other standards than MHP."
"Indeed, the final standard - the full interactive standard - for MHPs has not even been published, and yet colleagues here want to rush ahead and standardise it."
"That is not realistic."
"I also find a lack of realism about the whole idea that somehow we want to impose a particular business model on broadcasting."
"This resolution contains a rather unnecessary attack on vertical organisation and my group, and I hope Parliament, will reject that element."
"As the Commissioner said earlier, this is an issue on which I and other Members have worked in connection with the electronics communications package."
"We have put competitive instruments in place to stop vertical operators from abusing their dominant position in the marketplace."
"There are also must-carry obligations that we expect member governments to enforce."
"The first thing we should be saying to the Commission is that we want them to be enforced."
"They are critical."
"It is not up to us to enforce a particular business model."
"We are not there to do that."
"On the question of application interfaces and the technology, the key word is 'interoperability'."
"It is not a single standard, and just having a single standard does not mean you automatically get simple authoring or interoperability."
"We have three mediums in the United Kingdom already - cable, terrestrial digital - a powerful access for people to get onto the digital system - and satellite."
"Each of those has a different interface."
"The Commission needs to encourage what I call a toolkit for digital authors."
"That will allow digital authors to come on and have a common set of principles within which they can develop programmes for any platform."
"That is the sort of practical thing the Commission needs to work on. It certainly needs to monitor how MHP is developing and to see whether that needs further encouragement."
"However, we are already well down the road to the digital revolution already, and the sort of interference that is being implied by some colleagues here - I am pleased to say not in the resolution - will not help the way forward."
"We must be realistic about what is going on in the market-place and what consumers are buying now."
"Mr President, as the representative of a thriving but also highly endangered media centre - namely Munich - I welcome this question by the Committee on Culture and today's debate."
"I must make one thing quite clear: the European Parliament has a very long tradition in media policy, especially on television issues in Europe."
"It dates back to the beginning of the 1980s with the highly prophetic report on European television by the former Culture Minister of Baden-Würtemberg, Professor Hahn, who was MEP for Heidelberg at the time."
"It was way ahead of its time, even if some of the proposals made then have long since been overtaken by events."
"But in the intervening years, this House has lobbied consistency for European television, through to the telecommunications directive and the Television Without Frontiers directive."
"What were the two core elements?"
"First, we have stated quite clearly that we want to prevent this necessary, proper and important technology from being abused, by setting unequivocal ethical standards."
"And secondly, we have constantly reiterated that this is a question of competition, and not just competition within Europe, but the competitiveness of Europe per se."
"Today we can see that this European market stands in increasing danger from non-European suppliers and non-European monopolies."
"I therefore take the view that we really do have to go the way proposed today, namely the way of voluntary convergence and harmonisation, but that this should not be used as an excuse for doing nothing."
"I therefore emphatically support what Mrs Hieronymi has said."
"We really do need a deadline."
"We know from the Member States - of which there are presently fifteen but of which there will soon be twenty-five or thirty - that they are not exactly quick off the mark when it comes to action plans."
"Having come down in favour of voluntary action, we really should set this deadline for the Member States by the end of this year, as far as submitting action plans is concerned."
"Otherwise we will have to come up at the beginning of next year with ways of speeding up the process."
"I share the view expressed by Mrs Echerer, that hopefully there will be no need for the Commission to step in with binding proposals and standards, but I fear it may come to that."
"I should therefore like to again urge the Member States to submit their action plans by the end of the year."
"We need to make it quite clear that we are as concerned about the competitiveness of Europe per se as we are about cultural diversity in Europe, the cultural diversity that makes Europe what it is and - and this too is an important point in this resolution - the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"And the challenge here is for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We in the European Parliament see ourselves as the champions of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are perhaps still shying away from a great deal in the dimension facing us."
"Commissioner, thank you for your clear and detailed reply, but may I say quite unequivocally that, if the Member States fail to submit their action plans by the end of the year, we shall have to meet again in January in order to discuss how the European Union is to proceed."
"Mr President, honourable Members, unlike Mr Posselt, I do not represent the endangered media centre of Munich, I represent the media centre of Cologne."
"And if I am not from Cologne itself, then neither is Mr Posselt from Munich itself; however, as a Rheinlander like Mrs Hieronymi, I have a regional connection just like Mr Posselt."
"And the only reason I am standing here talking on cultural policy issues is because I have had to jump into the breach and replace my honourable friend Karin Junker who is ill and whose illness is too serious for her to be here."
"So, Mr President, if you hear me making a speech that is completely off the mark, attacking my honourable Christian Democrat friends in the usual battle of principles between left and right, it is because I am not the expert in this particular field that I consider myself to be in other areas."
"Thank you for your friendly show of agreement."
"Mrs Junker has instructed me to say the following on her behalf: the audiovisual sector is a growth market and a powerful economic factor."
"Mr Harbour made it perfectly clear in his speech that this is not just a question of the configuration of the market, it is a question of who on the market is exercising what influence and where."
"To give you a statistic: EUR 65 billion is the estimated turnover in the audiovisual sector alone this year in terms of gross domestic product."
"And the audiovisual industry is an employment sector, employing 950,000 people."
"It is this sector that will regulate access to information for the broad mass of people in the future."
"The average person, so Karin Junker tells me, watches 206 minutes' television a day and listens to the radio for 3.5 hours."
"I do not qualify as an average person."
"(Applause)"
"The objective we must work towards, as several honourable Members have explained, is that of a single European API or Application Programming Interface, to give it is proper name."
"So just as we have a single mobile telephone system, the so-called GSM system, we need one API and not 15 different APIs in the European Union."
"If we want a competitive market, then we need a single system."
"Which is why the difference between us and Mr Harbour is easy to explain, because what Mr Harbour has said is precisely the position of someone who insists that isolationism, of an insular nature, will obstruct the creation of this API."
"MHP is the only open, interoperable standard which meets the requirements which need to be imposed on this system."
"The European Commission should, as the Commissioner has already explained in detail in his reply to the five questions put by Mr Rocard, quickly take the initiative and introduce this standard."
"I share Mr Posselt's view: if the Member States fail to make a move on this issue in time, then we must take the initiative."
"The comment that television is the number one source of information does not just hold true for viewers during election broadcasts on the eve of elections in the Federal Republic of Germany; access to television, access to this democratic, pluralistic information system is a fundamental democratic right of all European citizens and needs to be anchored in the plurality of democracy."
"Access must be guaranteed, irrespective of the form of television on offer in the future."
"And if the future of television is digital, then access to this digital television system is a basic question of democratic rights, plurality and the freedom of self-determination of our citizens on information matters."
"This is the only way of guaranteeing in future that, on the one hand, market suppliers will be able to offer all consumers a complete range and, on the other hand, our citizens the consumers will be able to make use of what is on offer with the greatest possible freedom of choice."
"We European Socialists here in this Chamber would like to remind Commissioner Liikanen that he promised to implement a single standard by 2004."
"If the media sector cannot agree on a uniform approach, then we shall go one step further."
"As Mr Posselt said and as Mrs Echerer said."
"Commissioner, the European Socialists in this Chamber therefore call on you to act as quickly as possible so that we can make progress on one of the fundamental questions for the future of a European information society as quickly as possible, but also in as pluralistic and democratic a manner and, my dear Mr Harbour, as uniformly as possible."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, seeing as there is so much interest in this issue I cannot pass up the opportunity to comment on the resolution that is to be put to a vote."
"I agree fully with the European Parliament that digital television as such, including interactive television, has tremendous potential for extending the reach of the information society."
"The Commission is already actively involved in advancing the role of digital television and promoting interoperability."
"In particular I would like to mention the eEurope 2005 action plan."
"This fully recognises the role of digital television in helping to achieve the Lisbon agenda for instance, as an alternative platform for citizens to receive on-line public services."
"Member States are asked to publish switch-over intentions by the end of 2003."
"Next year, the Commission also intends to adopt a communication on digital switch-over."
"Another communication, on which we are working now and which should be discussed at the Copenhagen European Council later this year, will analyse remaining barriers to open platforms in digital television and 3D mobile communications."
"The answers I have just provided to various parliamentary questions have outlined all the steps we are currently taking regarding interoperability in interactive television. It is important that interoperability evolves hand-in-hand with the development of the interactive television market."
"Given that interoperability in the field of interactive television is covered by the Electronic Communications Framework Directive we should avoid duplicating regulations by also covering this in the Television Without Frontiers Directive."
"Together with my colleague, Viviane Reding, we will ensure that complementarity and coherence are maintained between the electronic communications package, dealing with transmission and access issues, and the regulation of contents - for objectives of general interest covered by the Television Without Frontiers Directive, which will be the subject of a review next year."
"In conclusion, the Commission welcomes the resolution and calls for the development of digital television and the availability of digital television to the public at large to become a top priority on the political agenda."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wanted to say that I was going to vote against."
"I wanted to say it publicly."
"You are, of course, within your rights in informing the House of which way you were going to vote, but that does not change the outcome of the vote."
"Mr President, I know this does nothing to change the outcome but a great many Members entered the Chamber after the vote."
"May I suggest that we also return to fixed, reliable voting times on Thursday afternoons, especially as there are several places where the bell cannot be heard."
"I therefore urgently request that the timetable be rescheduled so that the honourable Members know when there is a vote and where there is not."
"Mr Posselt, thank you for your first comment, in particular, to the effect that the outcome of the vote is as it stands and cannot be changed."
"Mr President, I should like to go one step further than Mr Posselt."
"I should like to protest against the fact that the vote is being held now."
"According to the agenda, we should be voting at 4.30 p.m. and I can assure you that you cannot hear the bell upstairs in the offices."
"I do not know where your office is and whether or not you can hear the bell from there."
"We have arranged to vote at 4.30 p.m. and it is wrong to hold the vote now because not everyone in the building has arrived in the Chamber yet."
"Mrs Sommer, the Agenda clearly specifies that the vote will take place at 4.30 p.m. or at the end of the debate."
"My office is on the twelfth floor and I have to say I found the bell ringing rather a nuisance, since they rang it for 15 minutes without a break today."
"That is too much!"
"Mr President, you have in principle anticipated my point."
"Nonetheless, Mr Posselt is right."
"We need to discuss Thursday afternoon's agenda."
"I have no wish to gainsay my honourable friend Mr Whitehead, who said at the start of the debate that he had to give his speech and then leave to catch a flight, but to me it is absolutely unbelievable that a Parliament should arrange its schedule to accommodate Members' flight connections."
"We in the Group of the Party of European Socialists shall therefore be discussing this with our Rules of Procedure experts."
"Other groups should do likewise, so that we can return to the old schedule for Thursday afternoons."
"Otherwise we might as well spare ourselves the effort."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I think there are more fundamental questions to be asked following on from what our colleague said."
"If you look at the total amount of debating time that we had at September I and II and the fact that we are finishing now, the question is why did we need to have two sittings in September at all?"
"It simply is not necessary with the new Rules."
"I would ask you Mr President to take back to the Bureau that we are already seeing the highly desirable impact of the Corbett report on the Rules changes."
"We need to evaluate how many weeks we need to be working here, because, President, we are desperately short of committee time in this Parliament."
"We have a ludicrously small amount of committee time between now and Christmas to deal ..."
"(Protests from Mr Posselt)"
"It is true Mr. Posselt, and I will show you the agenda for my committee."
"We have a ridiculously small amount of committee time, and we should not be wasting time sitting around here waiting for something to happen, when we could be doing serious political work in Brussels in committee."
"Contrary to what Mr. Schulz is saying a true democratic Parliament would have a serious look at its workload and - I thank you for the interruption Mr Posselt - I believe there are many people who agree with me."
"Most of them have gone already, because they do not want to waste their time here on Thursday afternoon."
"Mr President, at a more mundane level, I should like to support those who are complaining about the change in time of voting in one regard."
"When the bell rang - and I did hear it in my office - I looked to the screen to see what was happening."
"And what did I see, but my esteemed colleague, Mr Harbour, speaking with great authority on the issue in hand with no indication that the votes were to follow next."
"For all I knew, it could have been a fire alarm or something else."
"Perhaps the screens could have given us better information about what was coming?"
"It was clearly indicated on the screen, Mr Chichester."
"There might be something wrong with yours - I do not know - but the time of the vote was clearly displayed on the screen."
"Mr President, I can confirm that the votes were indeed announced on the television screens."
"And it was thanks to that that I realised it was time to come to the Chamber to vote."
"Having said that, I have requested the floor simply in order to say to the British Members that if they think they are wasting their time here and do not have enough time to dedicate to the work of the committees, I suggest that they miss the Brussels sittings."
"In that way, we will have enough time in Brussels to work in committee and we will be able to dedicate all our time to the plenum here in Strasbourg until Friday morning."
"I believe that would cause no more problems: we would not waste our time and we would be working under very good conditions."
"I can see that feelings run high, and rightly so."
"If there are no objections, I will give the floor to another two Members who have asked to speak as well, and then we will stop."
"Mr President, this is a very naïve discussion by those who are always opposed to Strasbourg."
"And just what has been decided?"
"More mini plenary sittings have been convened for the next session in Brussels."
"In other words, there are a few people who never miss a chance to turn everything against Strasbourg."
"There is something, however, which I consider to be far more serious: we were told we could not hold a topical and urgent debate this Thursday because we held one during the first session in September."
"Do you seriously believe that questions of world history, urgent questions should depend on whether or not we have the honour of expressing ourselves on current affairs?"
"I would have thought it more important to use the time available this afternoon to deal with other urgent topics, which normally go by the board because we never have time for them."
"We would have had time today for anyone with any inclination to notice what we should have."
"Members of Parliament should be able to speak on important matters when the occasion arises."
"Today would have been a perfect opportunity."
"I therefore urge that urgent matters be allocated the time needed to ensure that human rights issues are not sacrificed just because a few people are in a hurry to get back to their constituencies."
"They can spend hours in their constituencies."
"But those who wish to speak because they think it is the right thing to do must have the chance to do so, especially on Thursdays."
"Thursdays do not end with a few 4 o'clock flights; they should end at 6.30."
"The issue you have raised, Mr Mann, has already been raised just now by Mr Posselt, with great feeling, feeling equal to yours, moreover."
"Mr President, I should like to pick up on what Mr Harbour said."
"First, my dear Mr Harbour, you are one of those who sets great store by the Treaty and if you read the Treaty, you will see that we have 12 regular plenary sessions a year and that, if necessary, we can hold additional plenary sessions in Brussels."
"If we were to take out these six days in the autumn, we would have time for committees, time for week-long surgeries and all the rest, instead of which we could use the time here really profitably."
"Secondly, this afternoon's agenda should have included a topical and urgent debate, for example on the coup in Côte d'Ivoire."
"Today we were told this would be discussed on 9 October."
"In other words, the Conference of Presidents decided that this urgent matter should be debated on 9 October, i.e. in a fortnight's time, instead of this afternoon, when it could have been slotted in without further ado."
"Thirdly, there was no Question Time this week, either to the Council or to the Commission."
"That, as I said earlier, is a fundamental parliamentary right and the fact that there was no Question Time was a violation of the Rules of Procedure."
"My dear Mr Harbour, I am very proud of Question Time; it is an achievement which mirrors a long parliamentary tradition in Great Britain."
"This line of reasoning, which appears to be common to the different groups, is extremely interesting!"
"Mr President, to return to our same topic of conversation, listening to Mr Harbour, Mr Mann, Mr Posselt and Mrs Grossetête, I now know why group chairman Poettering always looks so pale."
"Discussions within the European People's Party are so lively that it is a pleasure to listen to them."
"Perhaps you will invite us into your group one day so that we can share in your joy."
"(Applause)"
"But there is one thing we should learn from the debate, and I address this comment quite pointedly to the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The Corbett reform has been a help, we can see that every lunchtime when it comes to the vote."
"We have saved time."
"But to save time and then not use it for parliamentary business is wrong."
"(Applause)"
"I therefore think - and we shall be doing as much in the Group of the Party of European Socialists - that both you, Mr Vice-President, in the Bureau, and the groups at the Conference of Presidents should retable the question of the agenda, because if today is anything to go by, we cannot go on like this."
"(Applause)"
"My response is addressed to you, Mr Schultz, and to Mr Harbour and the other Members who mentioned the Bureau."
"The agenda is drawn up by your heads of group, by our group chairmen, at the Conference of Presidents."
"It is not decided by the Bureau, which has other, less important tasks."
"You should therefore reintroduce this debate in discussions within your groups so that the chairmen are informed of the situation which has arisen this afternoon, which, regardless of the different points of view, everyone has found a little odd."
"Now, Mr Schultz has issued a challenge and Mr Elles is going to respond to it."
"Mr President, on a point of order, firstly as Mr Schulz will well know, as he sees the lively debates in our group which go on in public and in private, we have already attracted one of his members, Mr Balfe, who is a member of our group now."
"We welcome any others who wish to cross the floor because we would like to have an overall majority in this Parliament, as we have in the Quaestors!"
"Secondly, Mr Schulz is quite right that we need to fill up the time."
"Perhaps that is why Mr Poettering is looking a little pale, perhaps it is overwork."
"As far as time is concerned, while we are in Strasbourg we should use it to full effect, otherwise it just influences the other part-sessions where we then have to do things that we would not otherwise do."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you have achieved the goal you set yourselves of continuing until 4 p.m. for it was clear that that was your aim."
"Tribute"
"During the night of 26 and 27 September 2002, a Senegalese vessel, Le Joola, carrying more than 1 000 people, sank near the Senegalese-Gambian coast."
"Now, nearly two weeks later, 476 bodies have been recovered from the sea and 500 remain missing."
"On behalf of Parliament, I wrote to express our sincere condolences to President Wade of Senegal and to invite him to convey our condolences to the families of the victims."
"It is important today that we should, in a solemn moment of silence, show our respect for the dead and the bereaved and to connect, from the northern hemisphere, with this African tragedy as an act of reassurance and solidarity that the south matters to us."
"I ask you to observe one minute's silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Last Sunday, 6 October 2002, his Royal Highness Prince Claus von Amsburg, husband of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, died in Amsterdam after a long illness."
"Prince Claus committed himself to Dutch society with strength, seriousness, dedication and, when appropriate, with humour."
"We are well aware of his dedication to the cause of international development cooperation."
"I would like to inform the House and our Dutch colleagues that, on your behalf and on their behalf, I have transmitted our sincere condolences to Her Majesty, Queen Beatrix and to the Dutch people."
"The Danish Presidency, represented by Mr Haarder, Minister for European Affairs, has expressed its willingness to make a statement on behalf of the Council on the situation regarding Iraq."
"Mr Haarder and the Danish Presidency are stepping into this at short notice. I want on behalf of Parliament to thank the Council and personally to thank Mr Haarder for doing so."
"The first item is the Commission report on the progress made towards enlargement."
"These reports were adopted before lunch today by the European Commission."
"With the adoption and publication of the accession country reports, we are now one significant step nearer to the creation of a truly continental-scale European Union."
"We are entering the final stage of a process which began with such inspiration almost thirteen years ago with the collapse of the Berlin Wall."
"Our Member States and not just the accession states must individually and collectively summon up the necessary political will to overcome the last remaining obstacles."
"In this House we are determined to use our best endeavours to ensure that insofar as we can make a contribution, this House will contribute to the removal of any remaining obstacles between now and the Copenhagen Summit in December."
"This enlargement represents for Europe an extraordinary and unparalleled act of reconciliation, healing and opportunity."
"It is the first time in millennia in our old continent that, by the free wills of free and sovereign people, we will be coming together neither forced at the point of a sword nor through the barrel of a gun nor any other oppressive force but by the use of reason, conviction and shared values."
"Today's debate is an important staging-post in this exercise."
"I would like in particular to pay a tribute to the European Commission and its services and to all of those in leadership positions and in the public services of accession states who have engaged in such extraordinary work of transformation."
"The Commission will remain central to the management of this exercise right to the end."
"We are coming to a time when we, the political class, must undertake our political responsibilities to reach out to our publics in terms of the calculus of consent."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great emotion that I take the floor to speak to this House today."
"When I took office, I made a commitment - before this very House - to make enlargement the top priority of my Commission, to make my Commission the Commission of enlargement, because in enlarging the European Union we will be consolidating an area of peace, security and democracy throughout the European continent."
"Three years later, I am standing here before you once again to tell you that this commitment has been honoured."
"The Commission has done its job and kept its promise."
"The Commission has carried out a careful study of the progress made by the candidate countries and I can now announce the names of the countries with which we recommend the Council should conclude negotiations by the end of 2002."
"I will now, if I may, read out the key points of the recommendations we adopted today."
"'Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia fulfil the political criteria."
"Bearing in mind the progress achieved by these countries, the track record in implementing their commitments, and taking into account their preparatory work in progress and foreseen, the Commission considers that these countries will have fulfilled the economic and acquis criteria and will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004."
"The Commission therefore recommends to conclude the accession negotiations with these countries by the end of this year with the aim to sign the Accession Treaty in spring 2003.'"
"In view of Bulgaria's and Romania's progress over the last year, the Commission notes the date - 2007 - that those countries have set themselves for accession."
"The Commission will do everything necessary to ensure that this objective can be achieved."
"Through constitutional reform and a series of legislative packages, Turkey has made considerable progress as regards the Copenhagen criteria."
"However, further efforts are needed."
"The Commission is therefore recommending that the European Union give more support and allocate more resources to Turkey's pre-accession preparations."
"To this end, the Commission will propose a revised Accession Partnership and step up legislative scrutiny."
"Turkey is encouraged to pursue its reform process and so advance its candidacy for European Union membership."
"Ladies and gentleman, just 13 years ago, Berlin was still divided by the wall of shame."
"The wall has been pulled down and Germany has been reunified."
"This re-establishment of freedom has allowed us to restore the historical unity of the peoples of Europe."
"Our common destiny is once again to build a common future, a future built on the fundamental values we share of peace, democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities."
"In 1993, the Copenhagen European Council offered the countries of Central and Eastern Europe the chance to join the European Union."
"Since then, these countries have gone through a huge process of change, moving peacefully from dictatorship to stable, participatory democracy."
"Their achievements are extraordinary."
"In the space of a decade, we have seen the holding of dozens of transparent, democratic national, regional and local elections, the adoption of thousands of laws and regulations giving shape to the new democracies and incorporating the Community acquis into national law, the training of tens of thousands of civil servants and magistrates to interpret and apply the new legislation and the participation of hundreds of thousands of elected officials, specialists and members of professional organisations in EU-financed training and cooperation projects in order to learn about our policies."
"All 12 countries satisfy the political criteria laid down at Copenhagen and democratic institutions are stronger everywhere."
"Lastly, the overall performance of the economies of the ten first-wave countries is gradually improving: their growth rates are higher than ours, their inflation rates and deficits are being managed and kept under control and direct foreign investment is flooding in."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we adopted today also highlights the remaining deficiencies in some sectors, for some countries."
"These failings have to be remedied before accession: the Commission will work with the authorities of these countries to ensure that the problems are resolved in good time."
"Our concerns continue to be centred on the administrative capacity of these countries and their justice systems, which are undermined by a lack of financial and, above all, human resources."
"We have endeavoured to address these problems through a EUR 250 million support programme."
"This programme is starting to bear fruit."
"Another weakness we have identified is inadequate preparation for implementation of the acquis in a number of crucial areas, namely customs services, taxation, veterinary and plant-health controls, the institutions managing and supervising agricultural policy and, lastly, the departments in charge of managing and controlling the Structural Funds."
"I should also mention a further two extremely serious problems: the corruption affecting many of these countries, with a few exceptions, and the shameful issue of the trafficking of human beings."
"This does not mean that nothing has been done in these fields."
"On the contrary, a great deal has been achieved already and the operation is almost complete in some countries."
"However, our report stresses the scrupulous monitoring the Commission has undertaken to conduct up until accession."
"We shall publish a final evaluation six months before the date of accession."
"To cope with the complexities of enlargement, the Commission will take all the necessary measures to reorganise its departments, increasing monitoring and support for the new Member States after accession and providing pre-accession aid for the countries that will follow those covered by today's recommendation."
"Mr President, our objective is still to sign the Accession Treaty in spring 2003."
"We are therefore entering the final stages of the process."
"In this regard, the Commission hopes that the Brussels European Council of 24 and 25 October will take the necessary decisions on the chapters still open, namely agriculture, financial issues and institutions."
"In this way, we can negotiate and conclude these chapters before Copenhagen."
"As regards Bulgaria and Romania, the Commission will put forward proposals for an enhanced pre-accession strategy in good time for adoption by the Copenhagen Council."
"Then for Turkey, which does not yet meet the accession criteria, the Commission will propose an enhanced pre-accession strategy with extra financial resources in the new year."
"The Treaty of Nice is still crucial and cannot be sidestepped."
"I therefore place my confidence in the Irish electorate, which will be voting on the Treaty again in a few days."
"I hope that the achievement of the historic objective of unifying our continent will not be jeopardised by this vote."
"Lastly, let me focus on the issue of Cyprus."
"Let us hope for real progress towards reunification of the island, even though the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council do not make it a precondition for entry."
"The Commission wants a reunited Cyprus to join the EU and believes this is the best solution for all."
"In recommending that the Council conclude negotiations speedily with Cyprus, the Commission is issuing a fresh appeal to the parties concerned to work towards reunification of the island."
"We call upon everyone to support the process now under way under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General so that a solution can be found before the year's end."
"The Seville European Council has already affirmed that the European Union 'would accommodate the terms of such a comprehensive settlement in the Treaty of Accession in line with the principles on which the European Union is founded.'"
"Ladies and gentlemen, all too often, I hear talk about the risks and costs of enlargement."
"I believe we can and must discuss this calmly and openly, for the costs have been analysed in detail and they are in line with the resources available."
"However, we should also - and above all - be telling the public about the benefits of enlargement, which are stability in Europe, unification of an artificially divided continent and the creation of the biggest single market in the world."
"Enlargement will unite us with economies that have lower incomes than the present Member States but which have greater growth potential."
"The situation was exactly the same in 1985, when the accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal were concluded."
"Now, nobody could doubt the validity and farsightedness of that decision, although at the time it was controversial."
"Enlargement is the new front line of the European project."
"It will give impetus to trade, investment, education and research. And to economic growth."
"As regards the costs of enlargement, we know that they are sustainable until 2006 because they are included in the Berlin financial perspective."
"I shall not hide the fact that the accession of ten countries will entail a significant financial burden, within the framework I have described, but this will be more than fully offset by the benefits brought by the consolidation of enlargement."
"Enlargement is not just about economics, however. It is important primarily for political and ethical reasons."
"Enlargement is the culmination of the process of European integration: the process that has given us half a century of peace and prosperity must be extended to the whole continent."
"Consider the recent events in the Balkans, where there have been thousands of deaths, whole communities have been forced to flee as refugees and entire cities have been destroyed."
"Enlargement is our political masterpiece since it will prevent such things happening."
"From this broader and more accurate perspective, the cost of enlargement is very slight compared with the cost of non-enlargement."
"In the coming months, we need to conduct a realistic and positive information campaign. We must touch the hearts and minds of our citizens."
"Enlargement has been made possible by great determination, tremendous political courage and a farsighted vision of history."
"Moreover, it will be a test of our commitment to our principles, for accession will force us to change as well as bringing big changes for the new Member countries."
"This is the task of the Convention."
"The institutional reforms that come out of it will have to be just as courageous and farsighted as our endeavours have been."
"It must be understood that, without radical, intelligent reform of the institutions, the success of enlargement could turn out to be unsustainable. Indeed, the new Europe needs a clear, stable geographical shape and institutional framework that all our citizens can understand."
"In other words, the time has come for a European constitution. A constitution that guarantees the rights of all the citizens and the role of the Member States."
"A constitution that preserves cultural and linguistic diversity whilst reinforcing solidarity. A constitution that completes the creation of a democratic European Union, a genuine union of peoples and States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude by looking beyond the impending enlargement, beyond its historical and geographical limits."
"We are inviting the new countries to join our Union because we want peace and stability across the whole continent."
"However, this process must not result in new barriers being erected just when we are trying to break down the old ones."
"We must keep this in mind when building new relations with our neighbours after enlargement."
"Here, I am thinking of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. They will be the new neighbours of the enlarged Union, which will one day extend to the Balkans region too."
"Focusing on our new European neighbours, however, should not make us any less receptive to the ever-increasing expectations of the Mediterranean countries, expectations that we have not yet managed to fulfil."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the process of European integration that started half a century ago has earned us the admiration and respect of the entire world."
"We alone are building a genuine, practical model for managing globalisation, if only across our continent."
"This globalisation is a democratic globalisation with a human dimension, a globalisation in which all citizens have an equal role."
"Our enlargement is an example to the whole world and a visionary act: it unites the whole continent for the first time and it makes us protagonists of history once more."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's recommendation by the Commission that the negotiations on accession should be concluded with ten candidates by the end of this year is perhaps the most important staging-post on the road towards the completion of what is currently the major project on the European Union's agenda."
"There is only one justification for our recommendation today - the ten countries have earned it!"
"The ten countries have succeeded, through their own efforts, in meeting the incredibly difficult and challenging criteria for accession to the European Union."
"I attach great importance to the comment that the Commission did not see it as its task to justify a desirable political accession scenario 'after the fact'."
"What we did see as our task was to provide you, the Members of the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States, with neutral and objective information showing which countries are ready and prepared for accession and the conditions under which this will take place."
"The progress reports were not produced on the basis of political stipulations."
"The Commission staff were given just one instruction: they were not to conceal, omit or prettify anything, and they were to indicate clearly where problems still exist."
"In our reports, we identify the problems by name."
"However, the key point here is that we have not identified a single problem which could not be solved by the end of 2003."
"Please do not be misled by the sometimes very critical tone."
"Of course, the issues which have still to be resolved must be put into the context of what has already been achieved, and if we look at what has been achieved in the accession countries over the last ten years in the transformation process and the preparations for accession, I must say that the progress made by the people in these countries is a truly magnificent and historic achievement which deserves our greatest respect."
"The Commission has developed a methodology which allows us to determine, as precisely as possible, where we are and what has still to be done."
"The Commission has also made a number of proposals concerning the ongoing monitoring of the commitments undertaken and the introduction of a safeguard clause in the Accession Treaty."
"Let me explain this in a little more detail."
"First of all, I must point out that our recommendation naturally contains something of a prognostic element."
"After all, the new Member States are not obliged to meet the criteria for membership today; they must do so at the time of accession. In other words, what we have to do today is to assess whether the remaining tasks can be completed within the timeframe."
"This assessment is not based on a feeling or mood; it is based on sound knowledge of the pace and quality of the preparation process in these countries."
"We will continue to apply all the tried and tested monitoring instruments after the conclusion of the negotiations and the conclusion of the Treaty, in order to ensure that all the commitments undertaken are fulfilled. We propose that for the first two years after accession, an entirely new clause should be introduced into the Treaty, one which has never appeared in any other enlargement treaty to date."
"This clause will ensure that rapid and targeted measures can be taken if it becomes apparent, within the first two years of accession, that the internal market is disrupted in any area, or if policies are not working properly in any area relating to the internal market. In this context, the phrase 'internal market' should be interpreted in the broadest possible terms; in other words, it relates to all policies with a cross-border dimension."
"I do not believe that this clause is necessary because the candidate countries pose a risk - they do not. I believe that this clause is necessary because this enlargement is quite unlike any other we have previously experienced and - if we are honest - we cannot tell precisely which adjustment problems are likely to occur within the first two years."
"This is why it is necessary to have an instrument enabling us to respond quickly and flexibly. I also think it is necessary in terms of the public debate in our Member States."
"Before we get to the stage of being able to welcome Members from ten new countries to our plenary here, several important steps must be taken."
"First of all, the Treaty of Nice must be ratified, and I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the voters of Ireland and ask them to consider, when they make their decision, that what is at stake here is the European future of nations in Europe. What is at stake is the European future of nations which did not voluntarily dissociate themselves from the European unification process, but which were forced to do so, which were forced to live separated from us behind the Iron Curtain, and which now wish to belong, once and for all, to the family of democratic nations in Europe"
"(Applause)"
"Secondly, at the European Council meeting in Brussels in a few days' time, the Member States must come to an agreement on the common negotiating positions which are still open."
"I was a little concerned, when returning from the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers in Luxembourg yesterday, about the complete lack of movement there."
"The Member States too must now be urged to show the necessary flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"If the timeframe is to be adhered to, we need to reach an agreement in Brussels on the financial package and institutional issues."
"Thirdly, the candidate countries must continue their work and continue their efforts. In doing so, they will undoubtedly be heartened by the Commission's recommendations today and by our debate here this afternoon."
"Finally, let me say a few words about Bulgaria and Romania."
"I am gratified by the progress made by these two countries."
"We did not decide that Bulgaria and Romania would not be included in the first round of enlargements."
"It is their own decision."
"They said that they wanted to be part of the process in 2007, and all the commitments which they have undertaken during the negotiations relate to 2007, not 2004."
"The Commission solemnly pledges to do all it can to help these two countries achieve this goal."
"The current enlargement process will not be complete until Bulgaria and Romania also have Members representing them in this House."
"(Applause)"
"Finally, let me comment briefly on Turkey as well."
"I take issue with the people who say that the Helsinki strategy was a mistake."
"On the contrary, it is apparent that since the Helsinki strategy came into effect around 18 months ago, Turkey has made more progress on human rights, democracy and the rule of law during these 18 months than in the previous five decades."
"We should - and we do - recognise this fact."
"(Applause)"
"Turkey, however, could not be expected to fulfil all the political criteria for entry to the accession negotiations within these 18 months."
"I do not wish to imply any criticism of Turkey when I say that it has not yet fulfilled all the criteria."
"On the contrary, I think it is remarkable that Turkey has achieved so much in such a short time. This is why Turkey must be encouraged to continue along this road, and the Commission will put forward suitable proposals to ensure that Turkey can continue along this road and the door remains open for Turkey."
"Let us not be distracted from the real task, however, namely to reform the country in such a way that it is ready for EU accession."
"Let us not be distracted from this task, and let us not enter into a fruitless statistical debate whose outcome is bound to be unproductive."
"Today's outcomes will be received in many countries of Europe with great interest, excitement and hope."
"Our task now is to ensure that Europe's citizens do not just understand but wholeheartedly endorse and welcome this project. There is still considerable scepticism surrounding this issue in many Member States, and this should not take us unawares."
"My impression is that the scepticism is often greatest in those areas where there is a serious lack of information."
"It is extremely important to ensure, over the coming months, that we supply people with information, information and more information and enable them to use the range of information productively."
"If this does not take place, we may have a very, very nasty surprise in a whole range of countries just as enlargement becomes the central issue on the domestic agenda, if people turn round to us - after the Treaty is concluded, at the very latest - and say: 'Why weren't we told about this?"
"Why did you do this without us?'"
"Involving the citizens is the key task facing us now."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the train that began its journey in Helsinki is now only two stations from its destination."
"It is very gratifying indeed that it has been possible to push ahead with the Commission's progress report to such an extent that it has appeared a month earlier than last year's, and it is also gratifying that we now have a complete basis for making decisions as to which countries are ready to conclude the enlargement negotiations."
"To begin with, I should like to thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for the commitment and the energy they have shown right from the start in carrying out this historic task."
"I followed their efforts from my position here in Parliament as soon as they took up their offices."
"It has been a pleasure to note and observe their commitment, which also shines through here in Parliament today."
"We have been given an objective account of the candidate countries' level of preparation."
"The Commission has come to the view that ten countries are ready to conclude the negotiations."
"They fulfil the Copenhagen criteria, and it is considered that, before the date of accession in 2004, they will be able to fulfil the economic criterion, as well as the criterion of being able to implement the acquis communautaire."
"On certain points, there is a need for further efforts with regard to administrative capacity, and the Commission proposes that consideration continue to be given to the candidate countries' preparations for membership."
"The recommendation to conclude the negotiations with ten countries is to be debated at the Brussels European Council in 14 days' time, and discussions regarding the final decision are to take place at the Copenhagen European Council in two months' time."
"According to the Commission, Bulgaria and Romania have made good progress since the last reports, but are still not so far forward that the negotiations can be concluded."
"As is well known, it was decided in Seville that special efforts should be made on behalf of these two countries, and a decision on this matter too needs to be made in Copenhagen."
"The Commission notes that Turkey has made great progress towards fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria."
"This is a gratifying development that must be maintained."
"It is also noted that there is still some way to go, and Turkey is therefore being encouraged to carry out further reforms and to implement reforms already adopted so that it continues to improve its prospects of membership."
"With regard to the Seville conclusions, Copenhagen will be the decisive moment in the development of the relationship between the EU and Turkey."
"In the run-up to the Brussels European Council, we must not now pre-empt the decisions to be made in Copenhagen."
"With regard to Cyprus, the Commission fully supports the EU's efforts."
"The Commission calls upon all the parties involved, and Turkey in particular, to take active steps to bring about a solution before the conclusion of Cyprus's negotiations for accession to the EU."
"The conclusions from the Helsinki European Council still form the point of departure for adopting a position on the issue of Cyprus's accession."
"Finally, I want to endorse what the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have said about the Irish vote, and I want to concur with the words of the President of the Commission about the risks and costs of not enlarging the EU, for the risks and costs of non-enlargement are much greater."
"That, of course, was why the track was laid in Helsinki."
"That is why the train is now travelling on towards peace, democracy and prosperity throughout our continent."
"The next station is Brussels and the last station is Copenhagen. The Danish train drivers are ready, and the whistle has sounded today."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important debate since it concerns the greatest challenge facing the European Union, namely the accession of ten countries in a first round of enlargement."
"I therefore find it especially regrettable that the substance of today's debate was revealed in the European press some days ago, and I would ask you, Mr Prodi, to ensure that in future, Parliament is informed first, and then the European public."
"I think this is the right way round if a debate like this is to be meaningful."
"Notwithstanding this criticism, however, which is meant very seriously, I would like to say a word of thanks to the Commission: to its President, Romano Prodi, to the Commissioner responsible, Günter Verheugen, but also to the previous Commission under Jacques Santer, together with Commissioner Hans van den Broek, for after all, the present Commission did not start from scratch; it built on the work begun by the Santer Commission."
"I would like to voice my warm thanks to all concerned for their great work."
"(Applause)"
"We are in broad agreement with the conclusions and also with the listing of the ten countries recommended for accession by the Commission, but there is a massive amount of work ahead of us."
"The accession countries - as has been stated, and for which we express our great respect - after 50 years of communism, communist mismanagement, communist tyranny and dictatorship, have made massive efforts, and this deserves the greatest credit and our greatest respect."
"However, there is still a massive amount of work to be done, not only by the accession candidates but also by the European Union itself."
"I think that what is important now is to ensure that we do not shatter the confidence vested in us by the accession countries. Anyone who now sets new accession conditions for the Central European countries, Malta and Cyprus - for example, by demanding reform of the European agricultural policy first of all - anyone who demands this is sinning against the accession countries, because it undermines their confidence in the European Union and its pledges."
"This is why we must now honour the confidence vested in us by the accession countries and not impose any new conditions."
"Poland is without doubt the most important accession country, for its population - almost 39 million - is larger than in the other nine candidate countries."
"We must also remember today that this great transformation in Europe would not have been possible without Poland, without Solidarity - and let me also say this, lest we forget - without the great intellectual power of the Pole who occupies the papal throne, John Paul II, who told the Polish people: 'Don't be afraid!'"
"This was the basis of Europe's intellectual and political transformation."
"(Applause from the right)"
"We must never forget this!"
"It was also the basis on which Germany could be united twelve years ago."
"Without Poland, this would not have been possible."
"We therefore hope that at the negotiations, Poland will be able - also in the coming weeks and months - to master the difficult problems still arising in the accession process, and we support the Commission with its proposals on direct payments."
"There are several unresolved questions to which we would welcome answers from the Czech Government."
"What is the Czech Government's position on the question whether, for example, legislation still exists in the Czech Republic which does not treat all persons in the European Union equally?"
"Is there discrimination here?"
"It would be helpful if the Czech Government provided an answer to this question."
"We hope that Bulgaria and Romania, which are not part of this enlargement round, will continue to make progress so that we can close negotiations with these two countries within a foreseeable timeframe as well."
"We endorse the Commission's position in declining to give Turkey a date for the start of negotiations."
"On behalf of our group, I would like to point out that we have divergent views on the issue of Turkish membership of the European Union."
"It is important to state this clearly, and it is the same in other groups."
"However, we are united in our view that Turkey is a key strategic partner for us, and that we must always maintain our links with that country in a close and well-functioning partnership."
"There is the problem with Kaliningrad, and I recommend, as a matter of urgency, that in overcoming this difficult problem, we prioritise the issue of security, and also Lithuania's sovereignty, which we must not call into question."
"On this basis, flexible arrangements with Russia must be found."
"I also warn against the creation of a new Iron Curtain, for example between Poland and Ukraine; in the region around Lviv in Poland and in other areas, there are close regional and family ties with Ukraine and we must arrive at flexible arrangements which guarantee security but also enable people to meet."
"The President of the Commission referred to the Mediterranean region."
"I have just visited Morocco, and there is great concern there that as a result of enlargement, we Europeans will forget about the Mediterranean."
"The Mediterranean region is our neighbour just as much as the accession countries in the heart of Europe, and I recommend that we take our cooperation with the Mediterranean as seriously as we take our relations with Eastern Europe."
"(Applause)"
"If twenty years ago, someone had asked: 'We are offering you the chance for Poland and other countries to join the European Union - what are you prepared to pay for this?'"
"This is a great day for Europe, for we have a shared and, it is to be hoped, a good future ahead for our European continent."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the Socialist Group supports the Commission's proposals which have been outlined today."
"Today is an historic occasion. In many ways it marks another stage down the road begun by Willy Brandt when he was mayor of Berlin."
"Before dwelling on the historic nature of today, I would like to acknowledge that it has only been possible to get where we are thanks to the determination of the Commission."
"When President Prodi launched the new fast-track method of negotiation, it radically changed the enlargement negotiations."
"I would also like to pay tribute to Commissioner Verheugen, who has pursued his brief with great determination and with a unique ability to master the detail while holding on to the big picture."
"He has also been a model of transparency and openness."
"Enlargement is first and foremost a security issue."
"It is about admitting countries to a political and economic system which has brought peace, stability and prosperity to countries which spent much of modern history trying to destroy each other."
"In our discussions about the details, we must not lose sight of that fact."
"We have it in our power to reunite Europe and to create a genuinely Europe-wide Union dedicated to building stability and prosperity, not only for its own citizens, but also beyond its borders."
"Inevitably, as enlargement approaches reality, the voices of doubters are beginning to be heard."
"Some say enlargement is too costly."
"To those I would point out that in the period of 2000 to 2006, we will spend one thousandth of one percent of the EU's GDP on the candidate countries."
"We will spend ten percent of what Germany has spent on its reunification."
"What we spend is a fraction of the cost of defending Western Europe during the Cold War."
"The real question is - what is the cost if we do not enlarge the European Union?"
"What will it cost in terms of the social, political and economic dislocation which will inevitably follow?"
"Some say they are in favour of enlargement but not yet."
"They say we must wait for the reform of this or that policy."
"But politics is not like that."
"We do not sit around waiting for perfection."
"Enlargement is a dynamic process which itself will drive forward the process of reform within the EU."
"Enlargement is actually the solution to the problems which concern our voters - the concerns about crime and drugs, about the environment, about jobs and a better future for our children."
"We have a window of opportunity to enlarge."
"If we miss this moment, it will be lost for a generation and the cause of reform will be lost with it."
"Enlargement and reform go side-by-side."
"I do not wish to underestimate the very serious issues that must be addressed."
"The core of the EU is the Single Market and there can be no weakening of it."
"There can be no question of admitting countries that cannot or will not enforce the aquis in this area, particularly in relation to state aids, competition policy and respect for intellectual property."
"There can be no question of admitting countries whose judicial system is corrupt or inept, or whose administrative capacity is not up to the task ahead."
"There can be no question of admitting countries unable or unwilling to take effective action to combat crime or the traffic of people and drugs."
"That is why I welcome the safeguards that the Commission has announced. I welcome in particular the economic safeguards in relation to the internal market which we have never had before, and also the commitment to have a further progress report six months before the date of accession."
"If there are problems then, we and the Council must have the courage of our convictions to act effectively in those circumstances."
"There are, of course, serious issues to be addressed in relation to agriculture."
"Firstly, there have been profound delays in the implementation of SAPARD."
"Money must be spent before accession to strengthen structures in the rural areas and to avoid a rural exodus and mass unemployment."
"The central eastern-European countries will have problems co-financing SAPARD because they will have to incorporate budget resources which they had set aside for 2000-2001 into their budgets for 2002-2003."
"Therefore, the Commission must take appropriate measures to ensure that SAPARD funds are not lost because of late implementation."
"The agricultural sector and the interests of the rural population are important to both the EU and the candidate countries."
"That is why we need a balanced solution to financing agriculture which does not offload the costs onto the weakest."
"Therefore, we strongly support the proposals Commissioner Fischler made in January because they are fully compatible with the Berlin Agreements and the roadmap for enlargement."
"In discussing further reform in the CAP, we must ensure that the accession countries are involved in an advisory capacity as soon as possible."
"We must have reform before Agenda 2000 runs out in 2006."
"Reforms, however, cannot be a further hurdle to concluding accession negotiations, just as enlargement should not hold up the reform of the CAP."
"As a former chairman of the Lithuanian JPC, I must raise the issue of Kaliningrad."
"I would urge that we find a solution which is deliverable for the Lithuanians and does not drive them into the 'no' camp."
"Today is not the end of a process."
"Today is, hopefully, the beginning of the end of a process."
"We must scrutinise the path forward very closely."
"We must remember that no other enlargement has been as well-prepared as this one has, but we must seize this moment in history to make progress."
"I would like to call upon the inspiration of the late, great Elvis Presley at this moment - it is now or never, tomorrow is too late."
"Thank you Elvis!"
"Mr President, many of us never thought we would witness in our lifetimes the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"That event changed the face of Europe and heralded a process of emancipation for our neighbours in central and eastern Europe which is nearing its conclusion."
"It is worth reminding ourselves of the 13 long years this process has taken as the siren voices of the sceptics seek to dash enlargement on the rocks."
"In a previous debate, I described enlargement as a process of continuous assessment, not a one-off exam."
"I thank Mr Prodi for presenting today the Commission's assessment of the readiness of the applicant states to join the European Union which marks those countries' completion of a major assignment in that process."
"They are now approaching the final examination at the Copenhagen Summit."
"The prospects look good although they still have some hard work to do in the months ahead if they are to make the grade."
"The Liberal Democrat Group has always sought to apply the Copenhagen criteria and the timetable, not to elevate one above the other."
"We, therefore, welcome the Commission's conclusion that the ten applicant states will be ready to join the European Union by 2004, but that monitoring of their preparations will continue."
"A reinforced monitoring system is necessary because the overview provided by the Commission clearly shows that there are deficiencies in the readiness of those applicant countries and we should be open about this."
"If we are to convince our own people of the case for enlargement, it must be clear that we are not sweeping problems under the carpet."
"Openness about those problems and the measures taken to tackle them will make us better able to reassure the doubters."
"I therefore call on the Commission to transmit to Parliament all the regular enlargement reports which it will make to Council."
"If we await the comprehensive monitoring report six months before enlargement, the Commission may have no alternative but to impose safeguards since the nuclear option of suspending enlargement may not be viable."
"I hope that the threat of those safeguards will be sufficient to ensure that they are not used."
"Neither should we forget, however, that it is not only our own voters who have to be convinced."
"There are referenda to be won in the applicant states."
"Critics in those countries who compare the European Union to the old Soviet Union are confusing a jacket with a straightjacket."
"Yet we must show those countries that they will benefit from enlargement from year one. This means a generous financial settlement which precludes them becoming net contributors in the short term."
"By introducing a secession clause in a new constitutional treaty, we would also assuage any fears that to join the European Union is to throw away the keys to freedom."
"My group is deeply worried that corruption remains widespread and that much work must be done to implement the acquis in justice and home affairs."
"We must be firm on the failings of the candidate countries, yet we must recognise that the report before us today is only a progress report."
"My own country struggled to meet the criteria 15 months before accession."
"Thirty years later, some might say that it is still struggling."
"One thing is clear, however."
"The monitoring of compliance with EU laws and respect for the Union's values is not a process which should end upon accession."
"The Liberal Group welcomes the date of 2007 along with a roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania."
"The steps which they need to take must be clearly outlined by the Commission in time for Copenhagen, so that they are clear on what needs to be done."
"The recent reforms undertaken by the Turkish Government represent a real breakthrough and, while no date can be set for Turkey's accession until the political criteria are met, we will watch with interest the implementation of these reforms."
"Turkey must be offered a pre-accession strategy accompanied by more financial support and a friendlier political environment."
"We must show the world that we are not an elite Christian club."
"The question of Cyprus will also have to be resolved to smooth the way for Turkey's entry."
"Here we look to Greece and Turkey to help broker an agreement before the Copenhagen Summit."
"The prospect of the whole of Cyprus joining the EU would start the Greek Presidency on a positive note which we hope would conclude, in Thessaloniki, with a summit symbolising reconciliation."
"In conclusion, the enlargement marathon is nearing the finish line."
"Despite the exertions thus far, the participants must be prepared for a sprint finish."
"Once they cross the line in Copenhagen, they will have little time to celebrate, the training for the next marathon begins - the marathon of meeting the acquis communautaire and achieving democratic endorsement of the enlargement process."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we are preparing to take an historic decision."
"The headlines of a Brussels newspaper yesterday said that in just over a year we will have to talk about the Twenty-five instead of the Fifteen."
"This is in itself good news."
"I think I speak for my group as a whole in welcoming all these European nations."
"We shall have to rise to the common challenge of successful enlargement."
"In order to succeed, however, we must address each and every problem if we want to avoid providing grist to the mill for people-pleasers or the shameful opponents of enlargement."
"And there is the rub."
"President of the Commission, I feel your presentation failed to address some serious problems."
"Let us take as an example the Community acquis, the most taboo subject of all."
"To you, and to many of my fellow Members here present, it is all or nothing."
"Any candidate country that questions any part of it would be excluded from negotiations."
"We all know, however, that some implications of the acquis will lead to acute, serious, dangerous social crises in these countries."
"We will not solve these problems by burying our heads in the sand. Quite the opposite."
"Transposal under pressure will solve nothing in the long run."
"There are some States among the Fifteen that have obtained compromises on matters concerning their specific identity, and even among the founding countries of the Community, there are signed texts that are now being called into question again, such as the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The citizens of the Union, meanwhile, as you know, are contesting the acquis even more."
"The liberal structure of Europe, and the non-transparent way it is being created from the top down without the involvement of the people, is increasingly unacceptable."
"Such debates are also taking place within the candidate countries, at the highest levels. This is borne out, for example, by the essential conflict between the Polish Government and parliament and the Polish Central Bank, which is considered too liberal and too independent."
"For her part, the President of Latvia goes so far as to express her feeling, and I quote, 'of colonisation' within the population with regard to the Commission's position on the agricultural chapter."
"You are aware of all that, yet you say nothing."
"I think that this is a mistake."
"You cannot bring down a fever by breaking the thermometer."
"There is another aspect that I would like to highlight."
"Our counterparts in the candidate countries have told me about some unfortunate incidents."
"Apparently, a Commission negotiator, when faced with a few reservations, settled the debate in substance with these words: 'either you sign, or you wait'."
"What is achieved by the arrogance of the strong towards the weak?"
"You achieve a signature now and ill feeling later."
"That is not the solution."
"We need to talk about this."
"I shall simply note a third problem, since everyone is familiar with it, but I do think we need to talk about it because overall success depends on it to a great extent."
"This is the problem of funding for enlargement."
"If my memory serves me correctly, the Commission, in 1999, set aside EUR 40 billion for the period 2004-2006, when six countries were involved."
"The same sum is now set aside for ten countries."
"How can that work?"
"And why are we not publicly reminding Member States which refuse the necessary financial solidarity that, over ten years, they, together with these countries, have benefited from an outrageous trade surplus of EUR 100 billion and that their companies are making substantial profits, the details of which we would like to know."
"Forgive me for being so frank, but our only chance of achieving successful enlargement in future is to address real problems now."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, the winds of change seem to be blowing in this Chamber."
"Having lived through a few historic changes, I am a little disappointed by the cold wind blowing in this Chamber."
"Exactly thirteen years ago today, the first demonstration which led to the fall of the Berlin wall took place in Leipzig."
"You, Mr Poettering, with your usual skill, recalled Solidarity, with which we are all familiar."
"I admit that as far as the Pope is concerned, you can have him."
"I shall, nevertheless, mention two other groups of Polish heroes that you forgot: the Polish resistance that fought against Nazi barbarism and the Jewish resistance that also fought in the Warsaw ghetto against Nazi barbarism."
"If we are talking about Poland and the fight against totalitarianism, we should mention all the Poles who fought against all types of totalitarianism."
"Let us come now to enlargement."
"I admit to being somewhat surprised, occasionally, by the condescending tone we use when speaking of the candidate countries."
"Clearly, they need to reform."
"Clearly, the change from a totalitarian culture to one of democracy and a market economy is difficult."
"But what I would have expected, wished, imagined, dreamt of, from the Commission at an historic moment, is for it to say that as enlargement is an exciting historical project, we, as Europeans, should try to project ourselves into history."
"What will the Europe we want be like in fifteen or twenty years with the Twenty-five?"
"And what are these petty debates taking place among the Fifteen today with regard to enlargement, when we hear what took place at the last general affairs meeting, with regard to giving two more seats to the Czech Republic, for example, or two more seats to another State?"
"When you think that we have still not managed to draw up a financial draft for agriculture, that we cannot draw up a financial draft for the Structural Funds ? and why?"
"Because the Fifteen today are afraid of history and are in fact creating a policy of selfishness."
"Let us call a spade a spade."
"Most of the governments steep themselves in history on Sundays, and on Monday they are afraid of what they dreamt the day before."
"That is why we are unable to progress."
"Mr Verheugen, as you said, you are asking for greater flexibility from the candidate countries with regard to financial problems."
"I would like to say that I personally am asking for greater solidarity and passion for history from the Fifteen."
"It is only through solidarity and passion with regard to enlargement that we will find the solutions to the more difficult issues."
"In a word, I would have liked to have received an explanation today, not of the old debate - should we first reform and consolidate before enlargement - but of the sine qua non conditions for successful enlargement, reforms and the consolidation of Europe prior to enlargement."
"This does not mean building a new barrier, but quite simply, Mr Poettering, making enlargement possible."
"If Europe continues to operate as it does at the moment, with the right of veto of one country or another in certain situations, we are heading for disaster and we are going to miss our date with history."
"That is the lesson to be learned. That is what I would have liked to hear so that we would be forced to act more quickly and carry out the process of the Convention in greater depth, with regard to agricultural reforms, Structural Fund reforms, reforms of the legal establishment in Europe, in order to make this establishment more democratic."
"Lastly, this should have been clearly stated."
"I myself am saying it on behalf of our group: what we dream of is, in ten or fifteen, or I do not know how many years, achieving social and ecological harmonisation across Europe, from Portugal to Hungary, from Poland to Italy."
"Total social harmonisation."
"I know that will take time, but is that our aim?"
"Is that our dream?"
"Or is it something we do not want, because we want to retain the differentiation between nations?"
"That is what I think is somewhat lacking in the speeches made by the Presidency and the Commission."
"But that does not matter, history can sometimes force us to be more enthusiastic."
"And you will see, you too, with your enthusiasm, will one day go down in the annals of history."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would like to say briefly to Mr Cohn-Bendit that passion is a wonderful thing but if passion is not based on pragmatism and common sense, it is wasted."
"If Mr Cohn-Bendit has passion in abundance at the moment, perhaps he would direct some of it to his Green colleagues from my country who are trying to convince the electorate that they should vote against the Treaty of Nice."
"If we want to be passionate, then let our passion be based on facts."
"The fact is that if the ten applicant countries proposed by the Commission - for whose efforts I am grateful and I thank Commissioners Prodi and Verheugen in particular - are to be part of the enlarged Europe which Mr Cohn-Bendit is dreaming of, then please tell the people of my country, on behalf of the Green Party of Europe, that they should vote 'yes' to the Treaty of Nice."
"We would welcome that."
"There is little point in being all things to all people at all times."
"Let us base our advice to the electorate on facts."
"It is wrong of Green Party Members to say to the people of my country that the Amsterdam Treaty provides for the enlargement process which we are talking about."
"It does not provide for the accession of ten new Member States."
"If we must have ten new Member States, as we want to, and then perhaps Romania and Bulgaria as soon as possible and then Turkey in due course, then let us put the truth to the people that the Treaty of Nice must be accepted if that is to happen."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on the tremendous work that it has done in dealing with all the applicant countries and the fact that it is now in a position to recommend ten countries for accession."
"I want to compliment Commissioner Verheugen for what he said in relation to Turkey."
"It is important that this Parliament recognises that over the last year and a half, tremendous progress has been made in Turkey and this should not be forgotten."
"Turkey's position today should not be seen as a rejection by the European Union in any shape or form."
"As far as Cyprus is concerned, I am glad that Cyprus has made considerable progress and that it has been recommended to us."
"I would also like to endorse what has been proposed to us by the Commission in relation to the political problem in Turkey and Cyprus, with the northern part of Cyprus occupied by Turkey."
"We should use all our influence to ensure that a role for the United Nations is accepted in this respect because there is no other way."
"Finally, I would like to say to this Parliament, to my colleagues and friends, that despite the best efforts of those in this House who have been trying to confuse the issue of the Treaty of Nice in relation to my country, the Irish people totally support enlargement."
"We will have a majority by the end of next week for the Treaty of Nice."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Ireland is one of the two countries in which a majority of people would regret the EU's being dissolved."
"The Treaty of Nice has been tested in the country which is most favourably disposed to the EU, yet 54% of the population voted against it."
"It would, then, have been more natural to have asked the inhabitants of other countries whether they cared for the treaty but, instead, the Irish were asked to vote on it again, as in fact they are doing, faced with the threat that, if they do not, enlargement will come to a halt."
"In all honesty, is there a single minister who would put the brakes on enlargement if the Irish were to vote 'no'."
"Of course not. Enlargement will continue."
"The situation is anticipated in the Treaty of Amsterdam in the form of a protocol which, by giving them a double majority or more votes in the Council, will compensate the five largest countries for the loss of their second Commissioner."
"This outcome was negotiated on the spot in Nice. It is not something to boast about, but it exists in a special declaration which is not part of the treaty and has not therefore been rejected, either."
"It can be called into play, irrespective of whether the Irish vote 'yes' or 'no'."
"I must also call upon the Brussels Summit to correct the figures."
"It is a scandal that Hungary and Turkey are being offered fewer places in the European Parliament than countries with smaller populations."
"The new weighting system is impossible to remember, even for ministers. Instead, a straightforward system should be devised which can be explained to the people of those countries that are shortly to vote on membership."
"There should also be more flexibility in relation to the candidate countries."
"The EU should not receive them like a steamroller that crushes everything they themselves have devised in the way of laws."
"We should be content to lay down requirements concerning their conduct in the common market and allow them to retain their freedom in all the areas in which there is no documented common need for cross-border laws."
"They should be allowed to decide for themselves whether to keep their national currencies."
"Agricultural land in the Czech Republic costs 10% of that in Germany."
"Why not allow the candidate countries to keep their laws concerning the purchase and sale of land."
"What would the Czechs say if Sudetenland were to be bought up with German euros."
"I come from that part of Denmark that was occupied by Germany."
"Today, we have an excellent relationship with our neighbours, which I commend and consider to be a model for Northern Ireland and other areas with national tensions."
"The Danish summer house protocol contributes to the good relationship between Danes and Germans."
"Without this, the best situated houses would be bought up, because the price of a German summer house is several times that of a Danish one."
"The transitional arrangements agreed with the candidate countries encourage unnecessary division and will give rise to many 'no' votes in the referendums."
"My group has different attitudes to enlargement."
"The Danish June Movement is heavily critical of the conditions we are offering the candidate countries, but those of us in this Chamber will vote in favour of them because we respect the candidate countries' own decisions."
"We hope that the many new democracies can breathe some democratic life into us so that we might obtain a slimmer, freer, open and decentralised Europe for all."
"With greater flexibility, Bulgaria and Romania could also join. It is a little sad to see them excluded, because they have been left to languish in poverty for a far longer period."
"Mr President, needless to say, we have always been in favour of a united and strong Europe in which each European people has its place and can retain its cultural identity."
"This also applies to the peoples of Eastern Europe who, for decades, lived under the Communist yoke and who for decades were unable to count on the solidarity of anyone in this hemisphere, of not a single one of the political families in this hemisphere who are now, however, all holding forth."
"I am therefore not opposed to the principle of European enlargement, provided that it is, of course, a European enlargement and not a small Asian enlargement to include a country such as Turkey, which does not belong to Europe, whether that is understood geographically, historically, politically or culturally."
"I am, however, opposed to a hurried and dogmatic enlargement such as is being prepared for today and which, I fear, is set to lead to major social, economic, cultural and social problems."
"Problems will arise in the current Member States, which will undoubtedly be faced with a major, fresh wave of immigration, but also in the candidate countries when their highly trained people, engineers, doctors, nurses, construction workers and many more will almost certainly, for financial reasons, leave their countries to find a better paid job elsewhere in Europe."
"If the free movement of persons, goods and capital will, in reality, generate more poverty, more immigration, more crime and more uprooting both in former Eastern Europe and here, then the responsible politicians should really first consider a method of guaranteeing a more harmonious unification process."
"Let us therefore take some time-out, let us go ahead with this enlargement, but let us admit: today, at this moment, the free movement of persons is not yet possible."
"If not, we are in danger of placing a time bomb under Europe which may go off more quickly than we realise, or to use La Fontaine's words: let us ensure that Europe does not await the tragic fate of the frog who at one time dreamt of being able, very quickly, to turn into an ox."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I would like particularly to thank the Commission for preparing for this occasion so outstandingly well over recent months. It has put forward a proposal, based on all the analyses that have been possible to date, which is viable - so viable, indeed, that it will be possible, in December, to take the decisions to invite ten countries to join the European Union."
"As the chairman of the committee responsible, let me say that we are making preparations to shape the parliamentary procedure as speedily as possible so that there is no delay on Parliament's part, and so that the date envisaged for the signing of the Treaties can be adhered to."
"I am convinced that overall, Parliament will endorse a positive outcome."
"This is a great moment, but this great moment does not mark the completion of the work, for the difficult negotiations will continue until December."
"It must be clear that we cannot hold the accession countries hostage to problems we face in one Member State or another."
"It must be clear to us that reforms must be undertaken in areas such as agricultural policy, but these reforms must not be framed in such a way as to give rise to an alibi for delaying the enlargement process."
"The internal process within the European Union must be shaped in a way that ensures that there are no trumped-up new grounds for delay."
"This is why we also call on the governments of the Member States to ensure that in those specific areas - such as agricultural policy and financing - where they have still not reached agreement, to do so as quickly as possible so that it is not down to us if there is a delay in the enlargement of the European Union."
"As part of this process, for example, we must try to resolve the Cyprus issue in a way that ensures that there are no new tensions or delays."
"I realise this is like squaring the circle, but I believe that this issue, too, can be resolved."
"It must be clear that, outside the European Union, there is nothing by virtue of which any of the accession candidates has any right to influence the timetable for enlargement as it affects any country whatever."
"There are many cases in which we too must have a clear awareness of this, regardless of the direction in which this is meant."
"In my view, the accession candidates also need to continue their efforts, and I would like to thank the Commission for placing such emphasis on implementation through appropriate administrative and judicial structures."
"The accession candidates still have a great deal of work to do before accession comes in 2004."
"Transposing Community law into national law is not enough."
"Capacity to implement this law in practice is also required."
"This means providing the necessary aid, but it also means making the necessary efforts."
"These efforts cannot end in December, for otherwise, we will find ourselves in a very difficult situation."
"This also means making it clear - also with regard to the Czech Republic - that we have a legal system which does not tolerate discrimination."
"In future, no EU citizen may suffer discrimination on any grounds whatsoever."
"The European Union is not there to settle old scores but to make a new start and break through the cycle of violence in Europe, and this means that everyone must be willing to make their contribution."
"I hope that the relevant reports commissioned by Parliament will be duly noted by all sides and the opportunity taken to unite this with appropriate signals, gestures and actions so that it can work well in practice."
"Let me just add one more sentence, which should really be the longest part of my speech."
"We too still have our homework to do, for we are not yet ready for enlargement either."
"For this reason, the Convention preparing the European constitution must be a success next year: this is a prerequisite if an enlarged Community is to function."
"Mr President, in its communication on the progress made in accession negotiations, the Commission confirms that Cyprus will be part of the first wave of accession, as decided at the Copenhagen Summit."
"I would like to thank the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Verheugen, for this proposal which responds fully to the expectations of the European Parliament and which should surprise nobody."
"Throughout the negotiation process, we have seen complete agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament over the fundamental elements of the Cypriot dossier."
"It also appears now that accession negotiations with the Republic of Cyprus have been a powerful catalyst in the United Nations' efforts to solve the political problem of the island in accordance with the rules of international law."
"Although nothing has been achieved as yet, and despite the threats of annexing and crisis from Ankara, the recent communication from the Secretary-General of the United Nations is still based on the idea that a political framework solution can be found by the end of the year."
"Parliament, in its latest resolutions, clearly listed the conditions with which such an arrangement would have to comply for Cyprus to be able to fully meet its obligations as a Member of the EU."
"The Cypriot federal state must possess a central government as well as a parliament to control it, which is able to take all decisions within the framework of the Treaty, as well as participating in these policies."
"It would also have to guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout the island's territory."
"The awakening of civil society and the surveys carried out in northern Cyprus confirm that the majority of the Turkish Cypriot population is also in favour of a pro-European policy."
"I therefore hope that vigorous political will will make it possible to overcome the remaining obstacles and that the forces of the Union will triumph over the forces of division."
"In the absence of this policy, or if it were hindered by external interference, the Copenhagen European Council would have to take its decisions in accordance with the Helsinki conclusions."
"Mr President, Commissioners, we in Flanders have been dreaming of being Flemish and of becoming European since the nineteenth century."
"With the accession of ten new countries, the European area of peace and stability is growing, and so is the scope for human rights and democracy."
"This is a reason to rejoice."
"Candidate countries were given powerful incentives to bring about the necessary changes."
"We, however, have not shown the same level of commitment to forcefully implementing the changes that are necessary to fashion this real Europe."
"Former enlargements have shown that prosperity has increased, both in the countries concerned and for EU citizens."
"Mr Prodi has stated that the costs will be reimbursed, but our citizens are not all convinced of this. Quite the reverse."
"It will require courage and powers of persuasion to remove the feelings of uncertainty and fear, particularly at a time of economic decline."
"Moreover, there are still flaws in the system."
"Mr Prodi himself mentioned fraud, corruption and the trafficking in human beings."
"The problems surrounding Cyprus and Poland's internal problems were also mentioned, and the discussion on Turkey is overshadowing everything else."
"We should not arouse false expectations."
"Hence the need for us to inform our citizens of what is at stake."
"We as regionalists and peoples without a state are very sensitive to the problems that still exist with regard to discrimination against peoples and cultural minorities."
"We are sensitive to the non-recognition of regional and historical realities in the different accession countries."
"All of this raises the question of whether we still have the time and resources to put these things right before accession becomes a reality."
"However, we are giving accession the green light today because a red light would be a sign of hostility, while we are, quite rightly in fact, dreaming of this area of peace and stability."
"Mr President, thirteen years after the liberation of Central and Eastern Europe and after a number of years of serious negotiation, we have now reached the penultimate stage prior to eight new Member States acceding from that region, and two from the Mediterranean Sea area."
"The candidates which, all things being equal, will be taking part in the European elections as fully-fledged members in 2004, will soon be able to send observers to this Parliament, something to which we are very much looking forward."
"The result presented to us by the Commission deserves warm congratulations, as especially does the person primarily responsible for this, Commissioner Verheugen."
"We said in Parliament at the time that the loose ends should be few and short."
"This is exactly what we are seeing in the transitional stage: loose ends that are few and short, except - understandably - for those that have to do with the environment."
"Casting our minds back to 1989, we can recall the general enthusiasm that greeted the return to Europe of peoples who had long been oppressed."
"This enthusiasm is still among us in copious amounts."
"It is therefore all the more painful to see how at some ministries, this return has been reduced to nothing but a money matter."
"Some hold the false, yet persistent, belief that the European Union, and particularly the addition of new Member States, would be costly and would require huge sacrifices on our part."
"Some xenophobic instincts also persist, and are the subject of shameless speculation."
"Communicating the truth, namely that the European Union only costs 1.27% of GNP and that, on account of internal savings, another 0.14% has been freed up for enlargement, that it has been settled in Berlin and fixed until 2006, in other words that the whole budgetary procedure is running smoothly, is a virtually impossible task."
"If some of this does manage to trickle through, there will always be some Finance Ministry or other which, by sketching worst-case scenarios, combined with strong exaggerations and their own interpretation of the figures, is prepared once again to awaken latent fears, put enlargement in a bad light and even to use the candidate countries as bargaining counters in the political wrangle with other Member States about the review of agricultural policy."
"This is transgressing the rules of decency."
"The care that the Commission has exercised on behalf of the Council is manifested in various ways, one being the statement that the permanent, sustainable implementation of the negotiation results must be monitored for the time being."
"In the coming years, there will certainly be reason to assist some new Member States, or show them the right way, particularly on an administrative level."
"What they have already achieved is indeed to be applauded."
"Such a clause was already used during the preparatory stages of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We then introduced the well-known article which even provides for sanctions if a Member strays from its path in terms of rule of law and democracy."
"This article applies to us all."
"As has often been established scientifically, including by our former fellow MEP Mr Burenstam Lindner, enlargements always bring economic benefits to all parties involved, to the existing Members more so than the new ones."
"More important, however, is the gain in terms of a fairer, more peaceful legal order in Europe and the establishment of a European community of values."
"The contribution to this by new members may be significant in this respect too."
"I hope that the same spirit which prevailed at the start of Europe's integration will also inspire the new and old Member States in future too."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's report shows a great deal of optimism but is also very realistic."
"I agree with Commissioner Verheugen: much has been achieved, but many more reforms are required and we as parliamentarians in particular must study and evaluate the reports with vision, but also with precision and pragmatism, just as we must scrutinise the outcomes of the negotiations."
"I would like to make one thing clear from the outset: without further efforts to establish the internal market, to integrate minorities - such as the Roma and Sinti - and enforce the rule of law, enlargement is unlikely to succeed."
"However, let me also say, on this point, that it is down to us to behave in a way which is likely to build bridges."
"Since the phrase 'Bene?"
"Decrees' has already been mentioned, let me say that I am very gratified by the studies commissioned by this Parliament, which show that there are no legal obstacles to the Czech Republic's accession."
"At the same time, I believe it would be conducive to the climate of the negotiations and the decision-making process if the Czech Republic could find the courage to clarify the situation, which would entail a reappraisal of the Bene? Decrees from a modern perspective - not as a demand or a condition, but rather as an offer."
"Let me make one comment in my capacity as a former rapporteur for Turkey."
"I understand that many people in Turkey, especially the pro-European forces, are disappointed by the Commission's proposals since they do not set a specific date for accession negotiations."
"However, I understand and endorse the Commission's position, and I see a great opportunity for Turkey if it does not simply fixate on a possible date but is prepared to work with the European Union on building a genuine economic and political partnership with the EU until accession is possible."
"The Commission's proposals are a starting point."
"However, more can be done, and we can work on this together in the coming months."
"I was asked today: what do I say to my constituents?"
"What does the Commission's proposal mean?"
"I would say that it means a resounding 'yes' to accession, and 'yes' to accession in 2004."
"However, it also means that it is up to the countries themselves to decide whether they want to fold their hands in their laps or whether they are willing to continue working on the reforms."
"My hope is that all the candidates are willing to continue working on the necessary reforms."
"Mr President, I would just like to thank Parliament for the immense, sincere support it has given us in our endeavours to make enlargement a reality at last."
"Without Parliament's support, we would not have been able to achieve the objectives that we have, and as well as the European Parliament I would like to thank the parliaments of the candidate countries."
"I have been present at many of the meetings they have held to prepare for enlargement and I can assure you that never before has there been such a deep-rooted, such a well-supported, such an important democratic process."
"It bodes very well for the future that this enlargement is being launched with such strong, such unanimous, such fine democratic intention."
"Mr President, in my former speech, I said how very grateful I was to the Commission."
"I should also like to say a big thank-you to this Parliament and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy which quickly reached a decision, with very broad agreement, to support this enlargement project."
"Parliament showed the way and Parliament can now see the result."
"Credit where credit is due."
"I have heard many debates in this house, but never have I seen such huge consensus on a project as many-faceted as that to which we are here giving further impetus."
"There was of course one dissenting voice and, since I am the only Dane speaking today, I should like to provide a little consumer information to Irish voters."
"In Denmark, no one is surprised at the fact that Mr Bonde is now conducting a campaign against the new treaty."
"He has conducted campaigns against all the treaties."
"He adopted an oppositional stance during the Cold War when he was against everything that strengthened the Western democracies against the Communist dictatorships."
"He was opposed to Danish membership of the EC."
"He was in the opposition camp when we voted for the first time on the Maastricht Treaty, as he also was when we voted on it for the second time."
"He conducted a campaign against the Treaty of Amsterdam, and now he is conducting one against the Treaty of Nice."
"That is fair enough as far as it goes, but it is not fair enough if the Irish electorate is unaware that, in supporting Mr Bonde, they are supporting someone who is against the whole set-up and who has been opposed to every single aspect of European cooperation."
"I just thought there was no harm in saying that."
"My apologies."
"Mr President, I should like to thank you for the opportunity once again to discuss this very topical and difficult subject with the European Parliament."
"As I said during the last questions on Iraq on 3 and 4 September, this debate comes at a time when there is a lot of international attention and debate on policy in relation to Iraq."
"When I was last here, I reported in broad outline on developments in the situation since the Gulf War."
"I emphasised that the EU's position is clear."
"It was expressed in a declaration by the Presidency on 20 May of this year, stating that the EU is calling upon Iraq to comply with the resolutions without delay including, specifically, the resolution whereby the weapons inspectors would be able to return, as anticipated in Security Council Resolution 1284."
"In this connection, the EU is well disposed towards the meetings between representatives of the UN and Iraq."
"We unreservedly support all the efforts on the part of the Security Council and the UN Secretary-General."
"This attitude was confirmed at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 30 and 31 August in Elsinore and also at the meeting of Foreign Ministers on 30 September and 1 October in Brussels."
"The EU also welcomes the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1409 of 14 May, that is to say the resolution on the revision of the oil for food programme."
"With what I have just said in mind, I want today to talk mainly about current developments in connection with Iraq and to concentrate on the Security Council negotiations concerning a new resolution, as well as on the negotiations with Iraq concerning the return of the weapons inspectors."
"The permanent members of the Security Council are currently engaged in negotiations concerning a new resolution on Iraq, based on an American draft."
"The United States wants to see a resolution that tightens up the demands made of Iraq in earlier resolutions, making them more specific; that sets earlier deadlines for Iraq's compliance with the demands; and that provides a mandate for a possible military intervention in the event of Iraq's not meeting the demands."
"The United States has stated that it wants the weapons inspectors to have unconditional access to all areas, including the so-called presidential palaces."
"Two subjects are absolutely crucial, namely the issue of a renewed mandate from the Security Council on the use of force, and unconditional, free and unfettered access by the weapons inspectors to all installations and areas in Iraq, including the presidential areas, which is to say the palaces."
"We in the EU are satisfied with the Iraq issue's remaining on the agenda of the UN Security Council."
"The hope is that the Security Council will reach an agreed position on the matter."
"On 30 September and 1 October in Vienna, the chief UN weapons inspector, in the form of the Swede Hans Blix, together with the Director-General of the IAEA, Dr El Baradei, who is responsible for the investigations into Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, met representatives of the Iraqi Government to discuss the practical arrangements in connection with the unconditional return of the weapons inspectors."
"Agreement has apparently been reached on a range of issues, based upon the demands made of Iraq in the Security Council resolutions already adopted."
"The issue of access to the presidential areas is still unresolved, however."
"In addition, there are outstanding issues concerning the ways and means of the weapons inspectors' return, such as the way in which the Iraqis are to be questioned by UNMOVIC, that is to say the UN weapons inspectorate, and the way in which UNMOVIC is to report back."
"The weapons inspectors will presumably not be sent to Iraq until a new resolution has been adopted and accepted by Iraq."
"It is still too early to establish the content of a new resolution."
"It is crucial, however, for an inspection regime that is effective and credible to be established."
"The EU attaches importance to going down the UN route, both in order to secure broad international support for the disarmament of Iraq and with a view to the credibility and effectiveness of the Security Council and of multilateral cooperation."
"Against that background, it is encouraging that, in his speech yesterday, the American President, George Bush, again emphasised the United States's readiness to go down the UN route."
"So much has been said. I should like here finally to say that it would of course have been better if this debate had taken place at a time when Mr Solana could have been present."
"Since Parliament insisted, however, on debating the matter in any case, I accepted the President's earnest invitation to take part in the debate."
"Mr President, I have already spoken twice about Iraq in this Chamber."
"My last intervention was just one month ago, on 4 September, right after the informal meeting of EU Ministers in Elsinore."
"Since then, Iraq has, for obvious reasons, remained the most important topic of international debate, though there is not all that much of substance that the Commission can add to what has just been said, or, frankly, to what is reported daily in the press."
"The most encouraging development since I last spoke was President Bush's speech which I heard at the UN General Assembly on 12 September and the Presidency referred also to the speech that he has just made in Cincinnati."
"It was important, of course, because Mr Bush signalled the American administration's wish, if possible, to work through the UN framework to tackle the threats posed by the Iraqi regime."
"From all corners of the globe, leaders of the world welcomed the US decision, and virtually everyone has put strong pressure on Iraq to comply with UN Resolutions."
"Of particular relevance was the extent of the renewed diplomatic efforts of the Arab world to press Iraq to allow the resumption of the inspections."
"These growing pressures have clearly helped drive Saddam to offer the return of the inspectors, even if his offer needs to be treated with a good deal of scepticism."
"We have been here with Saddam Hussein before, watching him in due course resile from promises made and commitments given, behind a smoke-screen of ifs, buts and maybes."
"The European Union has warmly welcomed President Bush's decision to deal with Iraq through the UN system."
"As a Union, we believe this is by far the best and incomparably the most effective way to take things forward."
"There is no real alternative to the UN system of values and international rules that was set in place and agreed by world leaders to preserve global security."
"It offers the best hope of avoiding the potentially disastrous consequences of a spread of unilateral actions allegedly to 'solve' regional disputes."
"Working through the UN confers legitimacy and a sense of moral consensus on the actions that it is sometimes necessary to take."
"Also in the last couple of weeks, one of the EU Member States - the one as we say coyly that I know best - has made public a detailed assessment of Iraq's possession of chemical, biological and, possibly, nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them."
"This report has shown the risks that these weapons pose to regional stability in the Middle East."
"A number of eminent institutes have also shared their assessments of the threats to global security posed by the Iraqi regime."
"They all agree on Saddam's attempts to rebuild his capabilities in weapons of mass destruction, taking advantage of the absence of the inspectors over the last four years."
"I would like to point out, incidentally, that these inspectors had previously done a better job than they are sometimes given credit for."
"There may be room for debate about how imminent a danger is posed by this armoury of lethal weapons, but I do not detect any serious dispute about its existence."
"Currently, discussions are taking place with and between EU Member States on the terms of a new UN Security Council Resolution designed to pave the way for a completely unconditional return of UN inspectors to Iraq."
"As honourable Members well know, there are various options under consideration, some of them at the instigation of Member States."
"As the Presidency made clear, European Ministers last discussed the situation of Iraq on Monday 31 September at the General Affairs Council."
"They reiterated the position set out one month earlier in Elsinore, including the overall aim of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, the need for the unconditional return of UN inspectors with unfettered access to every part of Iraq, and the need for the situation to continue to be addressed along the UN Security Council track."
"Against this background of intensified international diplomacy, I believe - and I hope the Parliament shares this view with me - that the following considerations should be uppermost in everybody's minds:"
"First, over recent weeks, leaders around the world have continued to repeat their calls for a multilateral response to the challenge posed by Iraq."
"They have clearly argued that the alternative of a unilateral response would be very unwise."
"And it is not just world leaders; our citizens clearly believe strongly that this is the right way to solve the problem of Iraq."
"Recent polls in Europe and the US, as well as public demonstrations, show that citizens would like any decision on Iraq to be taken within the framework of the United Nations system."
"Second, the main reasoning behind any UN intervention is the perception that the international community is confronted with the possession of weapons of mass destruction by a dangerous regime."
"There is a genuine and justified worry about both use and proliferation."
"In addition it has been suggested that these weapons could be supplied to terrorist networks, though some notable public figures, for example Brent Scowcroft, National Security Advisor to President Bush Senior, have expressed scepticism on this point."
"Others still have argued that there may be some links between Iraq and terrorist organisations with global links such as Al-Qa'ida."
"I am not aware of any convincing public evidence on this point, but perhaps I have overlooked something."
"The resort to the pre-emptive use of force is not a new idea."
"The international community for example decided to intervene in Kosovo on humanitarian grounds."
"The concept of humanitarian interventions was supported by UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in an outstanding speech three years ago."
"Through the action in Kosovo, the international community made clear that it was no longer possible for world leaders to hide behind the concept of national sovereignty to do whatever they wished within their own borders."
"It was recognised that people too have rights, not just the states in which they live."
"That seems to me to be a welcome advance."
"However, what is clear from the debates going on around the world is that we need to develop some kind of framework of international law to address such circumstances."
"Iraq cannot be seen in isolation from other equally sensitive cases."
"Should we not look at the principles to guide our international action and identify the circumstances that may justify international intervention when there is a clear and present danger, either within a sovereign state or outside its borders?"
"The view of international law that has more or less prevailed since the Treaty of Westphalia - as students of the work of Dr Kissinger will know - is no longer wholly valid."
"But I find it difficult to believe that any acceptable alternative view should not rest principally on UN mechanisms and procedures."
"Third, I am sure that those who are considering the need for a new resolution will be taking into account all options and scenarios."
"The international community needs to address how to frame a UN Security Council resolution or resolutions on Iraq."
"But they also need to think about what to do in case of non-compliance."
"This is a general issue of the utmost importance since it is related to the credibility of the multilateral system."
"We need to preserve the authority of the UN and the Security Council whose resolutions we have seen defied again and again."
"In this case, it is defiance by Iraq, but there are others in a similar situation of non-compliance."
"We have now reached the point when such lack of compliance with UN decisions needs to be addressed in an objective, serious and coherent manner."
"I hope that as events unfold in the coming months, we see a re-assertion of the authority of the UN with beneficial effects for Iraq, for its region and indeed for the whole world."
"We may then, in addition, be able to focus our efforts more constructively on the continuing bloody crisis in the Middle East."
"I cannot say that I find any alternative outlook anything other than profoundly disturbing."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are issues relating to the current situation in Iraq which are uncontentious, which we all share and where we have a broad consensus."
"The first is that Iraq must comply with all the UN Security Council's resolutions in full and without any ifs, buts or maybes."
"I am very grateful to you, Commissioner, for saying that it is not only Iraq which should do so, but we are talking about Iraq here today."
"Secondly, we all agree that the weapons inspectors must return to Iraq and that they must have unfettered access to be able to do their job properly."
"In particular, they must search for, and then destroy, weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems."
"I am most grateful to you, Commissioner, for making a further point on this consensus, and I am especially gratified that you did so by pointing out that the response to this situation, to the problem of Iraq, should be sought multilaterally and through the United Nations framework."
"That is the opportunity for us genuinely to resolve this problem once and for all."
"There are other issues where we do not have this consensus."
"They include, for example, the question whether the weapons inspectors who now have a mandate to go to Iraq must wait until the Security Council adopts a new resolution."
"I think that a definition of their mandate by the UN Secretary-General would suffice."
"If it is indeed the case that a major threat emanates from Iraq, then it is logical, after all, to ensure that these inspectors go to Iraq as soon as possible."
"At the same time, the UN Secretary-General must look at the issue of the embargo."
"While the inspectors are searching for weapons in Iraq, conditions must be re-established for the embargo to be abolished entirely, and for the embargo to be ended."
"I think this is axiomatic, but I would like to reiterate and underline this point here once again."
"While the weapons inspectors are searching for weapons in Iraq, the bombing campaign by the US and the United Kingdom, which is not based on any UN resolution, cannot continue."
"It should be suspended - I am phrasing this carefully - until we have the inspectors' report."
"Finally, the UN should prepare a roadmap for the destruction of weapons and for the inspections, and a roadmap for the embargo and for Iraq's reintegration into the international community."
"This would be an important step which could be initiated by the UN."
"In the context of the UN, let me say that if we opt for the UN, we cannot have a UN à la carte. In other words, we cannot comply with the resolutions which suit us and ignore the ones that do not!"
"We must be very clear about this, and I am in favour of our respecting and implementing all the UN resolutions accordingly."
"Mr President, we know that one reason for military intervention is the search for weapons of mass destruction, but there are, of course, other reasons."
"Parliament's resolution of May 2002 made a proposal which still has not been taken up."
"It suggested that an international ad-hoc tribunal be set up to try Saddam Hussein and his officials, and that the Commission should set up an office of human rights to collect the evidence."
"There are, of course, different reasons for intervening: humanitarian interventions, self-defence, Article 51, as was used in Afghanistan, and now a new proposal of anticipatory self-defence - the so-called pre-emptive strike - discussed by President Bush for regime change."
"Even the 'bullet in the head' option has been discussed."
"But this Parliament, surely, should have one thing in mind: the people of Iraq."
"Here I call for a prosecution of Saddam Hussein and his officials under the 1948 Genocide Convention."
"This is a crime against humanity of such a scale that it can never be forgiven and we must invoke justice and the rule of law."
"The Genocide Convention to which we and all our allies are parties imposes a duty upon us to punish all acts of genocide ordered by constitutionally-responsible rulers."
"It expressly envisages that an international court may be established for that purpose, preferably in the territory in which the crimes were committed and if not, elsewhere."
"In this way all perpetrators may be tried by such international panel tribunals which may have jurisdiction with respect to those contracting parties which have accepted its jurisdiction."
"The Nuremberg precedent reminds us that a torturer is a torturer even if you are in a uniform and you have accepted an order to torture one of your fellow men or women."
"In other words, being an official does not exempt you from prosecution."
"This means that we have an absolute duty to look not just at Saddam Hussein but at all of those officials."
"What are Saddam Hussein's genocidal acts?"
"In the past, we have seen the use of chemical weapons in the north, the decimation of the gypsies, the persecution of Jews, the Assyrian Christians, over three-quarters of a million displaced people, assaults on Shia Muslims and those of Iranian descent."
"Thirty years of murderous assault and still he goes after the remnants of those unfortunate people."
"Genocide now concerns the marsh Arabs: over half a million people destroyed in the last few years."
"They have lost their place, the people, the fish, the animals, the water, the land, their homes, their farms, villages, towns, boats and agriculture through killing, burning and draining."
"We have seen the total destruction of a unique, distinctively different and ancient tribal people."
"That is genocide."
"A UN resolution is required but we need the evidence to be brought up front, in front of the peoples of the world, to alter the perception of why this course of action is required."
"The establishment of the Office of Human Rights was accepted in principle by Commissioner Patten at our debate in May 2002."
"I urge him to set up this office without delay - we have already lost too much time."
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten, President-in-Office of the Council, as we speak, there is reason to hope that the new war with Iraq will not take place."
"It is not absurd to imagine that the resolution currently in the process of being adopted by the United Nations Security Council could finally be drawn up to encourage disarmament in Iraq rather than to legitimise a military intervention there."
"That would be a great victory of wisdom over irresponsibility, but there is still a long way to go."
"And can we do anything, while the decision is that of the member countries of the Security Council?"
"I am sure that we can, as it is clear that the requirements of our societies and the political initiatives taken by various States have greatly influenced the development of the positions of the main Heads of State, starting with George Bush himself."
"His goal was to change the regime in Baghdad."
"Apparently today the international community has only one possible objective, the disarmament of Iraq."
"He ordered the UN to either be on the side of the US or to stay on the sidelines."
"He nevertheless seems to understand that the framework of the United Nations is difficult to circumvent."
"He had put forward a theory of pre-emptive war."
"He now stresses that military action is not necessarily imminent or inevitable."
"Nobody is fooled."
"The American President has not given up any of his plans, but he is perhaps beginning to realise that international political life is not a western in which he can play the role of sheriff."
"I believe it is time to promote the mission of disarmament inspectors as an alternative solution to war."
"It was these inspectors who, until 1998, prevented Saddam Hussein from acquiring the atomic bomb and who destroyed stocks of chemical and biological weapons and their means of manufacture, military research installations, missiles and launch pads."
"Today, they say, their experience is greater still and their equipment more sophisticated."
"They are ready to start work again immediately."
"One of them, however, the American Scott Ritter, opportunely suggests that, upon their return, the embargo should be lifted. This mercilessly cruel burden was imposed twelve years ago on the population."
"My group, in conjunction with others, is going to take initiatives in this spirit, which you are all welcome to join."
"Furthermore, my group would consider highly useful a further declaration by the Council and the Commission on the new strategic doctrine published by the Bush administration on 20 September."
"I find it inconceivable that the European Union is silent on this text which magnifies what is described as the unparalleled force of the United States and emphasises their determination, to paraphrase, to act alone, if necessary as a pre-emptive measure, to extend the triumph of freedom."
"We cannot remain inactive in the face of the official confirmation of a doctrine which would undoubtedly lead to war in Iraq and which would lead to nothing less than the destruction of the collective security system set up around the Charter of the United Nations following the victory of democracies over Nazism."
"Lastly, we are still waiting for the beginning of the first stages of the implementation of the last parliamentary resolution on the Middle East."
"While George Bush draws the world's attention to Baghdad, however, his protégé, who, not long ago, he classed as a man of peace even though he is violating all the resolutions of the Security Council concerning his country, is attacking the Palestinians with indescribable cruelty, thereby exposing his own people to a new infernal cycle of vengeance and hatred."
"Europe still needs to prove itself on all these points which, in fact, form a whole."
"The status of world player cannot be decreed; it must be earned."
"Mr President, the European Union is an observer rather than an active player in the events currently taking place, and it may be because we are speaking as observers that, in many of our speeches, we are getting the facts all wrong, congratulating ourselves on what will probably be avoided - military attacks on Iraq."
"We should instead ask ourselves what we have done, what we ourselves have managed to do, as the European Union, to bring about a situation in which it will be possible to achieve that which we all hope for, to reach a point where military attacks are not necessary and the inspectors have full access to the Iraqi sites."
"It is my view that we have done nothing and that, if the situation we are observing has now improved, this may be partly, principally or wholly due to pressure from the United States and the ways in which that pressure has been exerted."
"Well then, it may be that what we have to do is endeavour to cast off our role of observer: we must do everything we can to avoid military action rather than just sitting here watching others make mistakes, running the risk, once again, that Europe will become not the Europe of Churchill but the Europe of Chamberlain, the risk that we will find ourselves once again in a position of impotence and inertia where we lack institutional and even maybe military resources and instruments and are thus unable to take any action."
"Do we want to develop alternatives to weapons, violence and destruction?"
"Then let us make a start!"
"We must explore the possibilities provided under international law for raising awareness and providing information, for defeating a regime which is waging a constant, daily war against its own people, a war which is constantly causing deaths in Iraq and which is a danger to the international community."
"We must see what we ourselves, as the European Union, can do rather than sitting here applauding or criticising the actions of those who do, at least, have the courage to shoulder responsibilities."
"Mr President, Commissioner Patten has referred to the dossier that was produced by the United Kingdom Government prior to the debate in the House of Commons."
"That dossier makes for some interesting reading."
"The most significant thing I found in it was a picture of the footprint of one of Saddam Hussein's palaces."
"Superimposed on this was a footprint of Buckingham Palace. Buckingham Palace was a minute corner of whole footprint of Saddam Hussein's palaces."
"This is quite important because it is said that Saddam Hussein does not want anyone to go into his palaces. Well, none of us want people coming into our houses."
"We do not realise that these palaces are basically cities in their own right and that is why all aspects of the UN inspectors' mandate must be adhered to."
"They must be able to go anywhere because palaces the size that he has, and he has quite a few, have the capacity to conceal major weapon sites."
"We must be clear that there should be no interference with the ability of the inspectors to go in."
"We know Saddam Hussein is a threat to the region and to his own people, but we know that for the interests of world peace we must act through the United Nations."
"This must not be unilateral action."
"UN resolutions, however, must clearly hold Iraq to account and there must be a willingness to follow through with action."
"It is not enough to threaten."
"We must be prepared to follow through with that threat if everything else fails."
"We must keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein."
"We must continue to enforce a no-fly zone, including giving the pilots the right to self-defence."
"If the UN sees this through, we will change international politics."
"There will be a whole new environment pushing towards multilateral action."
"If the UN is not capable of seeing this through, the whole multilateral element of international politics would be discredited and the world would become a much more dangerous place."
"Mr President, I have now been told several times that the EU wishes to go down the UN route, and I should therefore like to ask where that route is heading and for how long it is intended to follow it."
"We are agreed that Iraq must, as Mr Patten said, comply, like everyone else, with UN resolutions."
"Must not, however, the EU and the United States also comply with international law?"
"Can we, on the one hand, demand that a country comply with UN resolutions and, on the other hand, accept actions that are not approved under this legal system?"
"In short, I do not have a clear answer to that question."
"Will the EU demand a UN mandate from the UN Security Council before it supports possible action against Iraq?"
"What, moreover, will happen if the weapons inspectors really and truly do not find anything?"
"There has not of course been a shred of proof anywhere that weapons of mass destruction exist."
"If the inspectors really do not find anything, will the EU, then, work towards having the embargo lifted?"
"We know that the oil for food programme means that the Iraqi people are being kept on the verge of starvation."
"A host of false rumours is being spread as to how much money is coming in, but the calculations made on the basis of the actual figures show that every penny is going into the oil for food programme and that that is not enough."
"It will not do anything to take the Iraqi people off the breadline."
"The programme has managed to eradicate the Iraqi middle class and is responsible for Iraq's not having been in a position to repair its water supply, resulting in a steep increase in infant mortality."
"Will the EU make efforts to have the embargo lifted and will it, in that connection, remember Iraqi Kurdistan?"
"Will it remember that there is a people in the northern part of Iraq that will be vulnerable as soon as Saddam Hussein has the opportunity to express his anger?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even though many people have spoken out against a war in Iraq, the United States are continuing their threats with new demands, on the pretext of combating terrorism."
"Calls for American national unity have not been able to mask the social and economic difficulties there, its crisis of political confidence and its restrictions of democratic freedom, which are condemned by many American citizens."
"We are all aware, beyond the undeniable arguments concerning the reality of Saddam Hussein's power, supported thus far by Westerners, that one of the main targets of this war is oil."
"Such a war would also allow other objectives to be targeted, such as strengthening the direct hold over oil and gas resources in the Middle East, in order to kick-start growth in the United States, strike a blow to OPEC, one of Washington's pet hates, and weaken the Arab world, depriving it of any possible political opposition force."
"Furthermore, we cannot ignore the matter of the current context of the whole region."
"This war can only destroy the United Nations' efforts to consolidate international law in favour of fair, lasting peace."
"We know it will have further tragic consequences for the Palestinian people."
"This is borne out by Ariel Sharon's stated support for Bush, for whom the international situation represents an opportunity to strike further blows against the Palestinian resistance."
"Moreover, commencing military action in this region will set the Arab world ablaze, plunge the people into decades of poverty, and send weakened political regimes into the arms of fundamentalism."
"Do not think that our continent will be spared by this war."
"Europe will be the first target for terrorism and will be a breeding ground for tension, and racism and islamophobia will only increase."
"It is not too late to prevent this war."
"To do so, people everywhere, as widely as possible, must express their rejection of the US unilateral policy and it is time for the European Union to shoulder its responsibilities, and forcefully and vigorously restate its commitment to peace, the reason for its construction."
"Mr President, no one is in any doubt that Saddam Hussein is a brutal dictator. That is not sufficient justification for launching a pre-emptive attack on Iraq."
"If it were, we would be attacking many countries around the world."
"We need to be clear that the motivating force for this war is primarily about trying to ensure secure access to oil. President Bush cannot, of course, admit this."
"Instead, we are told we must go to war in order to destroy Saddam's weapons of mass destruction."
"Let us be clear about this, our moral authority might be a little stronger if we did not also have weapons of mass destruction."
"I also want to talk about the United Nations."
"Commissioner Patten said that working with the UN confers legitimacy."
"I agree it is a step towards legitimacy."
"It is a necessary but insufficient requirement for any action because the UN process is itself highly imperfect."
"In order to get agreement from the UN Security Council for the first Gulf war, the US used bribery, blackmail and threats and they will do it again."
"The resolution which the US is currently trying to get through the Security Council is not designed to avert war but rather to provoke war."
"Leaked drafts resemble nothing so much as a plan for unopposed invasion."
"A just war to the extent that any such thing might be claimed to exist can only be pursued when all peaceful means have been exhausted."
"In this case, peaceful means are not only unexhausted, they are being deliberately avoided."
"Mr President, it would be a grave misconception to look at the imminent attack on the Iraqi state as a new state of affairs."
"We all know that the attacks on Iraq are already underway on a massive scale in the no-fly zones in the country."
"I do not know under which international agreements they have been allowed to continue, but such attacks have only intensified and worsened the situation in the country."
"However we view, as a Parliament, the proposed attack on Saddam Hussein, we cannot look at it in isolation."
"The attack would be seen, along with the incursions against Palestine, as an attack on the Arab world itself."
"It would, along with the threat to oil supplies, globalise an already-escalating conflict."
"We condemn Saddam Hussein unreservedly for his regime which oppresses minorities and offends democracy in Iraq."
"A more sensible and productive international approach, however, would be to defend and ensure self-determination for all minorities in Iraq, especially the five million Kurds in the north of the country comprising one quarter of the Iraqi population."
"Human rights and freedom in Iraq would be better served were we to take that course of action, uniting minorities and the international community behind a common front to topple Saddam and all other world dictators."
"Mr President, a variety of things have been said."
"For my part, I have a number of questions to put to the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council, for it would appear that, once again, Europe and the European governments are very divided, and that is not good."
"Moreover, despite the endeavours of the Presidency, we see the range of positions of the European governments described in the press every day."
"My question is this: since France is part of the Security Council - and it is the only European country to be part of it - is there any form of coordination between the other European governments in respect of the French position?"
"What will a second resolution add to the agreements which have already been adopted regarding the sending of inspectors to Vienna?"
"Thirdly, the citizens of our countries are asking a lot of questions, ladies and gentlemen, including on the subject of the embargo."
"The public is wondering, in good faith, how it is possible that, in ten years of embargo inflicted upon the civilian population, the dictator, Saddam Hussein, has been able to rebuild his military and even his nuclear arsenal."
"Given that this has been possible, I believe we should open a UN investigation to find out who has broken the arms embargo that has caused the Iraqi people such great suffering."
"If it has been broken by members of the Security Council, then, clearly, the Security Council will also lose its credibility."
"I therefore feel that we must be quite consistent in our actions; we must find the best way to achieve the greatest success without, indeed, causing further suffering or further deterioration of international relations."
"This is Europe's role in my view but, once again, this time we have failed to realise it."
"Lastly, I feel that Europe must address the issue of combating terrorism and producing legal instruments for prosecuting terrorists, acting with complete honesty towards both the United States and the authoritarian regimes."
"Mr President, over the last few days the European Union has faced - indeed it is still facing - two crucial political questions which bear on its common foreign and security policy."
"The question of the International Criminal Court on War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity did not, I think, receive the best attentions of the Council of the European Union."
"Now we have the crisis in Iraq, which really must be given the Council's best attentions."
"And just what does that mean?"
"The UN and its decision-taking procedures have underpinned the international legal order for the last 50 or 60 years and have been used to resolve the most serious of political issues."
"We must not rock this boat under any circumstances, because finding a new legal order to underpin international relations will not be an easy or straightforward matter."
"This being so, when faced with varying opinions on how to deal with the problem of Iraq, the European Union must not under any circumstances go beyond the bounds set by UN Security Council resolutions."
"Secondly, it must lay down limits, down to the last detail, on how far we can go in controlling Saddam Hussein's arsenal."
"However, if it turns out that he has no weapons of mass destruction or the facilities to produce them, it must have a ready, unconditional answer to the question of the embargo, while monitoring developments to ensure that Saddam Hussein or anyone else in Iraq does not revert to procedures involving weapons of mass destruction."
"Nonetheless, we must admit that, as the European Union, we ought to be independent when it comes to certain decisions with crucial international implications."
"We cannot just fall in with whoever happens to be in power in America at the time, with the Clinton administration taking one tack and the Bush administration taking another."
"And, the investigation to find out if Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction should extend to anyone who has provided materials or know-how."
"They too must take their share of the blame."
"Finally, let us not forget the millions who are suffering, let us not forget the children who are dying and let us not forget that we, the European Union, must not be inhumane."
"Mr President, I should like to summarise my answers in a few points which are not new but which it is important to put into words."
"I should like to warn against trivialising the Iraq problem by comparing Iraq with various other countries."
"Saddam Hussein is fortunately a very special case with a very distinctive history stretching back a long way."
"Experience clearly shows that we shall not get anywhere with Saddam Hussein if the use of force is excluded in advance. Iraq must and shall comply with the demands made by the Security Council."
"There must be unconditional access for the weapons inspectors, including access to Saddam Hussein's extensive palaces."
"The EU will continue to support the efforts of the Security Council and campaign for a unified approach. That is important for the UN's and the Security Council's credibility and effectiveness, and it is important in relation both to Iraq and to future multilateral cooperation."
"The EU therefore continues to support the Security Council's work along the lines of finding a peaceful solution, insofar as that is possible."
"It is encouraging that the American President has recently said that war is not inevitable and that he wants to pursue the option of going down the UN route."
"Turning finally to the lifting of the embargo, the oil for food programme has in fact been revised."
"It is Saddam Hussein who has not so far made use of the opportunities it presents and, in that way, subjected his people to starvation."
"That is because, in this matter too, he is completely indifferent to the conditions of ordinary people in Iraq."
"He has other priorities."
"If we are to encourage him to think about his own people and about peace in the region and in the world, we must take a united stand - in this Parliament too."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"It is a great honour for me to be given this opportunity to speak in the European Parliament on where matters stand with the revision of the European Employment Strategy."
"Employment policy affects something of fundamental importance to human beings, namely the work we do."
"The Bible says that we must earn our bread by the sweat of our brow."
"Work has many other functions in addition to this, however."
"It is in the workplace that we spend most of our waking lives."
"It is here that we forge a large number of connections with other people, and it is often these people we miss most if we lose our jobs."
"The new areas that are to help make Europe into a leading power include an extensive labour market and social responsibility on the part of enterprises."
"All too often, the labour market is comparable to a centrifuge, in which far too many people end up on the periphery."
"We must therefore develop ideas about how this situation can be prevented."
"In Europe, we also face a series of common challenges which we must solve if we are to retain the European social model, combining economic effectiveness with good social security arrangements and a market economy with the welfare society."
"Enlargement of the European Union to include a number of Eastern and Central European countries - with or without transitional arrangements - means the free movement of labour in the new and larger EU."
"A number of countries, including Denmark, chose to embrace the free movement of labour from the first day of their membership."
"We in Denmark see no problem with the free movement of labour."
"On the contrary, we view the new Member States as a resource."
"The primary task towards the end of the year consists in reaching agreement on the framework for revising the Employment Strategy."
"In 2003, we shall then get to grips with the discussions concerning the actual strategy and the individual guidelines."
"As its point of departure, the Presidency has attached great importance to our obtaining a thorough debate before a new and revised Employment Strategy is devised."
"In that connection, it is important for all the central actors to have their say."
"To ensure there is enough time for the debate, we thought it important to give the subject a central place in the Danish Presidency's programme in the employment and socio-political area and to begin revising the strategy no later than at the first formal Council meeting."
"That provides the best opportunity to send a clear signal to the Commission as early as possible."
"The authorities in the individual countries naturally have a central role in connection with the evaluation."
"It is they who have been responsible for implementing and monitoring the strategy since it was introduced in 1997."
"They therefore have a great deal of valuable first-hand experience of the present strategy's strengths and weaknesses."
"The Commission is, of course, another important source of experience and results from the first five years."
"Over the last few years, other actors too have, however, obtained relevant experience to which consideration should be given in connection with the current evaluation."
"That applies especially, of course, to the European Parliament."
"In this connection, I took note of the points of view published by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the middle of September."
"I am able to go a long way towards endorsing the views that have been presented of what should be the core features of a revised strategy and the desires that have been expressed to consider how cooperation between the various actors can be further developed."
"Finally, I want to mention the national and European parties in the labour market who, actively involved as they are, also have important observations to contribute. Revision of the European Employment Strategy was on the Council's agenda in Luxembourg yesterday."
"It is therefore an extremely topical subject to be included on the agenda for the plenary debate here today."
"As is well known, the Commission's communication takes stock of experiences from the first five years of the Employment Strategy."
"It contains a general evaluation of the results achieved on the European labour markets, and it outlines the most important issues in connection with a revision of the strategy."
"The communication is a crucial point of departure for the debate now taking place in various forums."
"In addition to this communication, a common statement from, respectively, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Economic-Political Committee was presented to the Council meeting, providing their assessment of the most important principles for a revised strategy."
"The Presidency has always wanted them to be able to present a common statement."
"We think that a common statement, capable of being endorsed by the relevant Councils, was synonymous with the strongest possible political signal of what is wanted in political terms from the future strategy."
"A common statement is, moreover, in accordance with the current desire for better coordination between, and streamlining of, the various European processes such as the employment guidelines and the guidelines governing general economic policy."
"There must be no secret about there being many different points of view on how far the revision of the Employment Strategy should go."
"The Danish Presidency's ambition has, however, been firstly to work for a compromise capable of uniting those Member States that want to see the Employment Strategy considerably revised with those that want to see far fewer changes."
"For us, the task has therefore been to secure a common platform for further work."
"I am therefore pleased to be able now to report that the Council offered its unanimous endorsement of the common statement by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Economic-Political Committee."
"A strong political signal was thus also conveyed concerning the framework and principles that the governments of the Member States believe should form the basis for preparing for the revision of the European Employment Strategy."
"I should like here to state some of the most important principles."
"To begin with, it must be emphasised that the overall perspective of the Employment Strategy must be retained, with special focus upon the priorities for employment policy."
"This means that special attention must be given to the results that, based on the Lisbon objectives of more and better jobs, are to be achieved through the strategy."
"The ministers also approved the need to simplify the employment guidelines and, as far as possible, reduce their scope by having them focus upon common strategic priorities including national strategies for lifelong learning, supported by suitable objectives relating, for example, to the number of people who might be engaged in one form of education or another."
"Importance is also attached to the future strategy's helping meet the challenges faced by the countries concerned in the form of different demographic features, increased globalisation, the knowledge society and EU enlargement."
"There is agreement that the strategy should concentrate more specifically on the following broad objectives: job creation and increasing labour force participation, improved quality of work, improvement and modernisation of the functioning of the labour market and the ensuring of both flexibility and job security."
"To enlarge upon this, I would especially emphasise the need to increase the labour force supply via policies that promote jobs for women, older people and vulnerable groups; by encouraging active and preventive labour market policies that are effective and efficient; by reforming tax and benefit systems and so creating clear incentives for taking up, and remaining in, employment; by improving lifelong learning, skills and mobility; by increasing equality between men and women and by combating discrimination; and by promoting developments in entrepreneurship conducive to job creation."
"Finally, the Council, in expressing its support yesterday, expressed a wish for the strategy further to reflect the fact that the focus is on the medium-term challenges set out by the Lisbon strategy where, for example, the participation rates for women and older people are concerned."
"Implicit in this is the wish for greater stability in the guidelines over time."
"In other words, they must not necessarily be changed each year."
"The wish for stability also conceals the fact that work is under way to ensure a greater degree of coordination and less overlap between the various European cooperation processes."
"We in the Presidency view these general principles, endorsed by the Council, as a contribution and pointer to the Commission in connection with its ongoing work as the end of the year approaches."
"The Council's agreement yesterday means that there are a number of factors that will have to be debated further over the next few months."
"That is especially true when it comes to the more active involvement of the two sides of industry and of the European Parliament."
"There is therefore a clear desire to enter into more practical deliberations as to how the European Parliament can play a larger role in the preparation and development of the Employment Strategy."
"The role of the national parliaments is also to be recognised in this context."
"One important matter still to be dealt with is the whole discussion of the scope and of the type of indicators."
"These are crucial to monitoring the strategy and to ensuring that countries move in the desired direction and at the right time."
"It is therefore also crucial that, as soon as a clear picture of the new strategy emerges, there be a thorough examination of the existing indicators."
"The purpose of such an examination must be to ensure that the indicators reflect the core objectives of the revised guidelines."
"The objective must be a more efficient set of indicators, which are robust, comparable, more focused on the individual guidelines and based upon up-to-date data."
"We should like to achieve a situation in which we have fewer, but better, indicators."
"I want to emphasise in conclusion that the Danish Presidency wishes to make the Employment Strategy easier to operate and more serviceable as a starting point for employment-promoting strategies in the individual Member States."
"We must get away from the tendency to focus increasingly upon details and instruments and instead concentrate on the results to which the European Council has attached importance since the Lisbon Summit."
"In connection with revising the Employment Strategy, we must never lose sight of the big picture."
"Over the next few years, the idea of a revised European Employment Strategy is that it should help make Europe more coherent as a continent and as a society."
"The idea is that the Employment Strategy should be targeted and that the decision-making process in connection with the adoption and implementation of the strategy's individual features should become more transparent."
"In endeavouring to create ever more employment, the European Union should attach key importance to targeting and transparency, to involving a larger number of actors and to rooting employment policy more firmly in the Member States."
"We must never forget that it is the practical results that, in the last analysis, are the test of whether the European Union's Employment Strategy is effective."
"The methods must be put to the test in practice."
"Mr President, firstly I congratulate the European Parliament for its stimulating and constructive resolution which was adopted on 25 September 2002."
"It provides a useful assessment of successes and achievements as well as some of the weaknesses of the European Employment Strategy. It is, of course, important that it identifies concrete priorities for the future."
"The resolution was most valuable to the Council."
"The discussions we had yesterday in Luxembourg concerned both the evaluation of the European Employment Strategy and the streamlining of processes in the context of the Lisbon agenda."
"As the Minister said, there was a consensus between the Member States on the content and the procedures for the future."
"I am pleased to say that there is now a large common platform of shared views between the three institutions upon which we can base the further development of the strategy and, in particular, define the next generation of employment guidelines."
"I would like to concentrate on three main areas: policy messages, the process and governance of the process."
"First, as far as the policy messages are concerned, we all agree that the integrated coverage of broad areas is one of the positive achievements of this strategy."
"There is an agreement that there is a need to keep this wide range of issues within the strategy and not to narrow its scope."
"Some progress has also been made on the identification of key priorities. There is a long list of these, including job creation and increasing labour force participation; improving quality in work; modernising and improving the functioning of the labour market; ensuring flexibility and security; increasing labour force supply via policies promoting an inclusive labour market; promoting active and preventive labour market policies; reforming tax and benefit systems; improving lifelong learning skills and mobility and promoting developments in entrepreneurship conducive to job creation."
"Obviously the next step will consist of transforming this long list into a structured proposal for Employment Guidelines."
"It remains to be seen whether or not the current four-pillar structure, on which we have articulated the development strategy, is still needed in order to reflect these priorities, or if other groupings could improve their visibility."
"If possible, the guidelines should be reduced in number."
"This brings me to the second issue which is the process."
"Within the framework provided by the Treaty, the Employment Strategy should focus on the medium and long-term challenges to be met by the Lisbon 2010 deadlines."
"With a view to ensuring a clearer focus on outcomes and on the medium and long-term goals of the strategy, there is a need for greater stability in the Employment Guidelines which should not be changed every year."
"Member States' National Action Plans must focus more on implementation."
"Overlaps and duplications with other processes should be more limited, in particular, through coordination between the employment strategy and the broad economic policy guidelines."
"It is crucial that the respective roles and contributions be better defined."
"The third point concerns the governance of the process."
"This is an issue on which the European Parliament expressed great interest in its resolution of 25 September 2002."
"The ideas for future orientations which I have just outlined should provide a better framework for more openness and participation."
"Less and clearer objectives should make the strategy more visible."
"A stronger focus on implementation and results should provide a better knowledge-base and more transparency."
"Therefore, within this new framework, and with a stronger, more concrete focus, social partners would play a more effective role, and regional and local authorities would understand their role more easily and could participate more effectively."
"Further consideration should be given as to how the European Parliament could be actively involved in the design and development of the employment strategy and on how national parliaments can be better integrated into this process."
"There are major problems in some Member States, where the national parliaments have not participated in, nor have, in some cases, any idea about the employment strategy, the monetary procedures or the common goals."
"This is quite a long list of shared convictions and perspectives but the new process for the strategy has only just begun."
"As you know, the formal proposal for the employment guidelines 2003 will be presented in April 2003 together with the proposal for the broad economic policy guidelines."
"In the meantime, there is room and time for everybody to become part of the process and to make their voices heard."
"The Commission will continue to develop the idea of open participation."
"In order to further stimulate and facilitate the involvement of potential stakeholders, the Commission intends to adopt another communication. This will be presented in January and will give an outline of the revised strategy with concrete objectives and targets."
"There is enough time for a rich exchange of views with the Parliament over the next few months in order to define and to agree on procedures for the new European Employment Strategy."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mobility is an important factor in creating better jobs and in closing the skills gap in the European labour market."
"A gap clearly exists, however, in occupational and geographical mobility in the Union."
"With regard to the first of these, European citizens do not change jobs very frequently, although most Member States have experienced an upward trend since 1995."
"With regard to the movement of workers between Member States and nationally, the picture is no more encouraging: our rate of mobility is almost half of that of US citizens, with only a small elite of 225 000 European citizens moving to another Union country; in other words, 0.1% of the population of the Fifteen."
"This is why, in February 2002, the Commission produced an action plan for skills and mobility that identifies 25 measures intended to respond to the shortcomings and needs indicated by the high-level task force."
"I feel bound to criticise the Commission for having presented its proposals directly to the Barcelona European Council before giving Parliament the opportunity to comment on them."
"Whilst the coherence of the action plan's recommendations should be highlighted, European citizens still face many obstacles."
"In this report, which I had the honour of drafting, in accordance with the Hughes procedure, in cooperation with the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport and incorporating the opinions of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities and the Committee of the Regions, which proved to be important and valuable contributions - I would highlight various measures intended to promote occupational and geographical mobility and the elimination of obstacles to their full realisation, some of which I shall now discuss."
"Firstly, local authorities should be involved in setting up a network of industry-based and educational advisory bodies to bring the world of work and education systems closer together; other, more effective actions need to be taken in order to reduce regional imbalances given that the basic reason for regional inequalities in terms of employment growth is the differences in the skill and educational levels and the mobility and adaptability of the labour force;"
"Secondly, Member States should provide support for one of the pillars of the European Employment Strategy - the entrepreneurial spirit - using the necessary funds, and coordinate their training-related activities more closely;"
"Thirdly, we must highlight the important role of the social partners in promoting access to training so that workers can achieve more and better qualifications and skills; the participation of the social partners is also crucial to monitoring the action plan at European, national and regional level;"
"Fourthly, Community legislation on the mutual recognition of qualifications must be more strictly applied;"
"Fifthly, youth exchange programmes, the awareness of cultural diversity, linguistic ability and citizenship must all be encouraged throughout training;"
"Sixthly, in order to combat the under-representation of women in high-technology sectors, support must be provided for the adoption of training actions and for the introduction of information and communications technologies and new systems of learning that guarantee women priority access, not forgetting the training and retraining of older workers, the disabled and other disadvantaged groups;"
"Seventhly, the crucial role that teleworking could play as a response to a geographical mobility that workers do not want;"
"Eighthly, the transferability of pensions is one of the most sensitive issues in this area, because pensions constitute a major obstacle to mobility, and workers who have acquired rights to a pension in their Member State could risk being unable to transfer these rights."
"Directive 98/49/EC and Regulation 1408/71 must, therefore, be updated, simplified and extended and the coexistence of situations of double taxation with those in which this does not apply must finally be eliminated; a further major contribution to fostering geographical mobility is the creation of the European health insurance card, which is expected to be up and running in 2004;"
"Ninthly, we must highlight the use of the Eures system, although this must be extended and brought up to date."
"I shall now address the Commission, so that it takes account of the importance of this instrument and fulfils the good intentions expressed in its communication on this particular aspect; the objective of transparency and of centralising information on employment opportunities within the Union can be achieved through the creation of a one-stop site providing information on mobility as well as campaigns aimed at individual industries."
"I would also highlight the fact that the candidate countries must combat the brain drain in this area; we must help them to create their own structures for innovation and to promote the exchange of experience."
"Member States, local authorities, employers, social partners and Community institutions must actively seek to ensure the success of this action plan and the measures that have now been presented must be taken into account in the revision of the European Employment Strategy"
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Bastos on her report and her presentation of it and to thank the rapporteur of the Committee of the Regions, Mrs Arnold, for her input."
"The action plan for skills and mobility consists of 25 points designed to give the citizens of the European Union greater mobility."
"Basically, the objective of the action plan is to remove obstacles to living, working and studying between one Member State and another."
"The objective is not, by any stretch of the imagination, to make mobility compulsory; it is to put conditions in place which make it easier for anyone who so wishes to move within the European Union."
"The Commission is delighted at how well Parliament has received the action plan and with its support for these measures which, as you know, were approved by the High-Level Task Force on Skills and Mobility as the most suitable way of improving the conditions upon which mobility and lifelong learning for our citizens depend."
"Parliament's report contains a number of undertakings which are even more ambitious than those made by the Commission in the action plan, although I have to say that, given the priorities laid down in part by the Barcelona Council, the Commission has endeavoured to make the action plan as realistic and feasible as possible, taking account of the legislative procedures required in order to keep to the proposed deadlines."
"The action plan contains a series of specific targets which will be used to evaluate its success over coming years and we shall, of course, need a number of indicators in order to assess its progress."
"These indicators will be defined together with the Member States."
"We need the Member States to be actively involved at all levels, especially as a great many measures under the action plan are largely measures for which the Member States have jurisdiction."
"I should like to point out that we need coordination and we need collaboration between the Member States on education and vocational training, especially when it comes to the mobility of young people, exchanges of best practices and transparent professional qualifications."
"As a result of the initiative by the Commission and the Member States, the Council will issue a resolution on 12 November on reinforcing cooperation in the field of vocational training."
"The point of reinforced cooperation is to improve the quality and attractiveness of vocational training overall and to address the lack of transparency and mutual trust hampering the recognition of professional qualifications and skills from one country to another."
"The implementation of the plan is under way, legislative proposals have been submitted, new procedures have been designed and the Council has been urged to take decisions on the proposals already tabled."
"The Commission has made provision for close collaboration with the social partners, especially on two points: first, on the question of lifelong learning and, secondly, on the facility to transfer supplementary pension rights."
"More specifically, especially on the matters addressed by Mrs Bastos, there are already plans to set up a website containing information on job mobility by the end of the year, so that European citizens can obtain information on the European job market and a number of other areas to do with mobility."
"It will also provide a direct link to the learning opportunities website which will be up and running in 2003."
"The Commission is to pass a decision revising the Eures system, so that it efficiently supports the mobility of European manpower, the objective being for Eures to provide services and information both to job seekers and to companies looking to recruit at European level."
"Thirdly, the Commission will be tabling its proposal on the European health insurance card at the beginning of 2003, which Parliament already knows about."
"I should also like to mention two horizontal issues."
"First, there is room to improve the position of women across the board and the gender dimension must be taken into account in all individual measures and, secondly, we face an important challenge in the run up to enlargement: Parliament has voiced its concern about the danger of a manpower drain from east to west; this sort of mass exodus would create a huge problem for the candidate countries."
"The connection between immigration and employment is to be discussed at a joint OECD/European Commission conference in January 2003."
"In the meantime, the Commission is discussing a draft directive from last year on conditions of entry and residence for third country nationals looking for paid employment or freelance work, so as to ensure that the Member States take a common approach on this issue."
"The action plan for skills and mobility is a very complicated and ambitious plan containing a whole host of measures which, if they are to be implemented, require very close collaboration between the European institutions and the social factors and social partners."
"May I make a point of thanking Parliament for the support and interest which it has shown in this plan right from the outset."
"Mr President, may I start by saying how much I welcome the Commissioner's remarks, and also those of the Danish Presidency."
"The concept of putting employment in a central place in the Presidency programme is absolutely right and sets exactly the right tone and example not just for us but indeed for successive presidencies."
"I would like to make some general remarks and then touch on my report."
"Certainly it is fair to say that generally, Member States and this Parliament too often skate around the important issue of employment."
"There is much talk but little action and such action as there is often unhelpful."
"Certainly my own country sets a rather poor example in this respect."
"Last year 4 600 employment regulations were introduced."
"That is one every 26 minutes."
"That is hardly the way ahead."
"But it is not enough for us to have separate programmes and projects, welcome as those may be."
"It is not enough just to set targets whether for young people, women, the long-term unemployed etc., and then sit back and watch."
"It is not enough to focus so firmly on job protection, trying to keep current jobs alive even when the market has moved on."
"We need to focus on job creation, which means liberating enterprise."
"We need to recognise that the greatest engine of employment growth in all our countries is the sector called 'small and medium-sized enterprises'."
"We must help them succeed and thrive and not hold them back."
"We need to realise that full employment helps create social inclusion and not the other way around."
"The Lisbon Council said, and I repeated this in my report, that we need to encourage a regulatory climate which is conducive to investment, innovation and entrepreneurship in general."
"Two years on, we have simply added to the burdens on business, and high unemployment in continental Europe is our own fault."
"I am heartened, however, by the lead that the Danish Presidency is trying to give and I would like to thank Minister Frederiksen in particular for a most helpful letter that he sent me on 18 September."
"I am sure he will not be embarrassed if I share with colleagues just one paragraph which is very pertinent to our topic of discussion today:"
"'My clear stand is that the European Union should only step in with legislation where there is an obvious need for such regulation and, in such cases, only to the necessary extent."
"There should be room for manoeuvre at the national level and if regulation is introduced it should, in my view, to the highest possible extent, be in the form of framework directives rather than detailed rules."
"There should also, wherever possible, be a freedom of choice as to the method of implementation as is, for instance, the case in connection with the open coordination method in the employment and social field."
"Finally I would like to emphasise that I also attach great importance to the principle of subsidiarity.'"
"Those are extremely wise words and we all look forward to them being translated into action."
"Similarly, the comments from Commissioner Prodi back in July saying that the intention was to simplify regulation by at least 25%, and to do that with all speed, is also to be welcomed."
"Again, we wish to see some flesh put on those particular commitments as soon as possible, preferably again under your leadership and presidency."
"As far as the growth and employment initiative is concerned, I was delighted that this was approved unanimously in committee and that we had made some progress in becoming lighter on our feet."
"The first report on this multi-annual programme was in January 2001."
"The second year's report was made only 11 months later, and this year the report is actually in October."
"Next year I would like to make it earlier still, and I would look for the earliest possible feedback from the Commission to make this possible."
"Specifically, however, I would like to point out how much I welcome the Commission's cooperation in providing information and updates at regular intervals."
"I welcome the progress that has been made and in particular the way that the programme has been managed and has developed."
"I would like to see some clear responses and some action regarding the proposals made by the Parliament both last year and indeed this time around."
"Very simply, I would like to see the next Commission report show that it has not only read Parliament's report but has actually responded to it. This means including a fuller analysis of certain aspects of the initiative and also the winding up of the Joint European Venture, the JEV Programme, in its current form."
"I am reminded that at the end of the debate in December on exactly this subject, Commissioner Liikanen accosted me just after he finished speaking and asked whether the Parliament agreed with winding up the JEV Programme, because this was what the Commission very much wanted to do."
"I told him that Parliament did indeed want to see the programme wound up."
"He said he was very relieved to hear that and would now get on with it."
"So far, I have not seen much action in winding the programme up."
"The Commission needs to be much quicker and lighter on its feet on such issues, but then, so do we all."
"Mr President, SMEs play an important role, both from an economic and a social point of view."
"They are therefore a key political priority."
"The relevance of small and micro-enterprises was recognised by the Feira European Council."
"This is why they should benefit from the EU financial instruments to a much greater degree than they have so far."
"To achieve this, the Commission urgently needs to recognise and readdress three areas."
"I am not entirely satisfied with the explanations we have had from the Commissioner."
"The Commission needs to tackle the lack of information SMEs and micro-enterprises have about these programmes."
"Access to information about how to get financing is an essential starting point for encouraging entrepreneurship and SMEs' activities."
"Therefore, the Commission and Member States need to launch campaigns to give SMEs clear and simple information on how to benefit from EU projects and programmes."
"Second, there is too much red tape and too many complicated financing procedures."
"These need to be eliminated."
"In Europe, SMEs have to face many more obstacles when accessing financing than is the case for SMEs in the United States."
"We have heard about the Joint European Venture Programme and why it has failed."
"We must look at the figures."
"One of the reasons is that one in five projects was refused by the Commission or withdrawn due to the level of administrative requirements."
"This needs to be investigated."
"Also, the Commission failed to put in place the groundwork before they launched the JEV Programme because it was not marketed in some states, there were no intermediaries, and if you look at the UK, there was only one."
"This meant that the programme was doomed to fail from the start."
"I know that in my region there are many micro-enterprises and SMEs who would have welcomed the opportunity to be involved in this programme."
"I hope that its successor will address some of these problems because this programme is important, especially for the candidate countries."
"Mr President, I would like to welcome the Commission's action plan on skills and mobility and Mrs Bastos' report."
"Whilst it is the lack of jobs rather than the lack of mobility which is the main problem for the unemployed in Europe, the issues identified by the Commission taskforce are very important."
"I would like to make a few specific points that were highlighted by the Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities Committee:"
"First, gender mainstreaming is a requirement for all Commission documents, but an annex to this action plan explaining how it was done in this case would not only help ensure that the measures are adhered to, but would also demonstrate how mainstreaming was achieved in a practical way."
"This would be a good example for other policy areas."
"Second, regional initiatives are proposed to support training for women in occupations where they are not equally represented."
"The revised Equal Treatment Directive allows Member States to provide such additional vocational training in areas such as the scientific sector and this should be built on in the action plan."
"Third, the action plan proposes the formation of industrial, educational and other advisory bodies."
"Whilst I know that membership of these bodies is not always within the Commission's jurisdiction, a clause requiring the Commission to ensure equal representation when possible sends everyone involved a very clear message that this is desirable and expected."
"Geographical mobility means more, of course, than simply getting a job in a different place."
"There are other issues to be taken into account, particularly for workers with children: access to housing, social services, good quality education and childcare."
"The report makes several points which I welcome and which are important to women, such as qualifying periods for supplementary pension rights - as mentioned by the Commissioner - and the use of best practice to encourage more young women to take an interest in mathematics, science and technology."
"I hope Parliament will support the report."
"Mr President, I should like to thank both the Council and the Commission warmly for their introduction, but I should also particularly like to thank both our PPE-DE rapporteurs, Mrs Regina Bastos and Mr Philip Bushill-Matthews, for their reports."
"After all, it is important not just to debate the general aspect, but also to address two very specific components of the employment issue."
"First of all, the SMEs which are, of course, of key importance to the economic structure, and Mrs Bastos' report which naturally mainly concerns the labour market structure and the EU's education and training structure."
"If these are not kept in step with each other, then something is wrong."
"At present, the economy is, of course, not in terribly good shape."
"This will undoubtedly have an impact on the labour market."
"We already know this and we should be prepared for this."
"This is why I wonder whether the Council is not a little too upbeat."
"Is it not relying too much on figures from the recent past, when growth and the development of productivity were far better than now?"
"A second question that can be addressed to the Council is, of course, whether they are not being overly optimistic in combining all these processes."
"We are certainly not opposed to this, but are we not in danger of creating another Johannesburg Summit of some kind, or to put it in biblical terms, a Tower of Babel, with all these processes happening simultaneously?"
"Will this produce any extra benefits?"
"This is my second question."
"A question I should like to ask the Commission, one that is related to what I said on a general note, is the issue of whether the Commission takes account of its own directives."
"I am very aware of the fact that as soon as a social directive is issued, very extensive discussions on employment will follow immediately."
"This is currently the case with, for example, the directive on working conditions for temporary staff."
"There are also other directives, though, in the field of the economy itself or in the field of annual reporting, and there are many complaints, also from SMEs, that these directives are very detrimental to employment."
"I will give you an example that occurred this week, namely Commissioner Bolkestein's Take-Over Directive."
"This directive will almost certainly cost tens of thousands of jobs in the Netherlands and in Germany and, in time, will undermine the present social system."
"Is this taken into consideration in the Commission's decision-making process?"
"Does consideration of how many jobs will be lost come into it at all?"
"Or is the focus in respect of these inherently sound intentions on the social directives?"
"If this were the case, this would, in my view, be wrong."
"I would therefore like to find out from the Commission whether this was the case here, and if not, whether this is likely to happen in future."
"As I have already said, we are still facing a difficult situation in the area of employment."
"I think that a number of things can still happen at EU level."
"I would, for example, mention the issue of the arms industry, which is very badly regulated in Europe, and where we could achieve far better employment levels but also far better efficiency than at present."
"I know that a lot of people would prefer not to talk about this too much but would rather leave this to the course of time."
"This too is therefore a problem that I believe we need to consider."
"Finally, I think we should still be very careful not to look exclusively and excessively to America, and to believe that they do everything better than we do."
"We have seen a few recent cases - it is enough for me to mention Enron, but also the current strike on the west coast - in which the United States does not do so well."
"I would urge the Council and the Commission mainly to try to adopt the good things that are happening in the United States and not too many of the bad things, and also not to think that we are doing so badly on all scores."
"We often do much better than we think."
"Mr President, I too should like to thank the Commission, my fellow MEPs and the rapporteurs for this policy document."
"It is important for us to try to attain the Lisbon goals and for this purpose, we must certainly develop the area of employment and training."
"I therefore welcome this proposal."
"We must learn from the past, for without the past, there is no future."
"In order to achieve the goals agreed in Lisbon, however, we will also need to consider better labour mobility, and I particularly have the border regions in mind."
"We need more harmonisation and more cooperation in the tripartite system of government, industry and knowledge institutes, mainly in order to stimulate working across borders."
"This is why I have tabled an amendment to promote this."
"Fortunately, the Committee on Budgets has already adopted an amendment to this effect and I hope that the same can be done in this Chamber."
"At the moment, the transnational labour and knowledge potential that is available is still very much under-utilised, and this must improve."
"Furthermore, we should in future consider the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and diplomas, something that we are, in fact, already addressing to a large extent. Eventually, however, the cross-border harmonisation of social security systems, social policy and even tax policy will also need to improve."
"I assume that the Council will deal with this and will be tabling proposals in due course, particularly with a view to promoting this mobility and the exchange of knowledge across the borders, for as we know, there are very few Europeans who move from one region to another, particularly to look for employment."
"Unlike Mr Pronk, I should like to point to the Americans, who have no difficulty whatsoever in looking for another job within a one thousand kilometre radius."
"As for his comment on take-over bids, I should like to note that in my view, European enterprises are better able to run as a result, and if they run better within the internal market, this will eventually lead to better investments and thus to more employment."
"As you see, Mr President, it is possible for us to have different views."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Frederiksen and Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"I shall keep my comments brief, for small groups have little speaking time."
"I thank our fellow MEPs Mrs Bastos and Mr Bushill-Matthews for their contributions."
"I should like to outline a number of key areas."
"We are discussing the revision of the employment strategy."
"If we look at the current guidelines, and the priorities as they are at present formulated, then it is clear that the employment strategy has, in fact, partly been overtaken by the Lisbon process, and the Lisbon process, has, in turn, been overtaken by an economic downturn."
"This means that a great number of things are actually in the balance."
"Labour participation targets are probably not realistic; there is no employment; it is only possible to offer incentives if employment is on offer and if the offer of employment is promoted."
"The question is, however, whether we are always able to do this."
"I am very interested to find out about these new guidelines and also very interested to see what we can get rid of."
"How can we sum this up?"
"I can understand that things are different for youth unemployment, but a number of other types of work, such as jobs for the elderly, cannot always be promoted."
"I welcome new guidelines and do not believe there is always a need for pillars."
"These guidelines should, however, be clear and simple, just like the new relationship with ESF and the funds."
"With regard to streamlining, I actually endorse Mr Pronk's view on this, namely that streamlining and integration are closely connected."
"If we talk about integration, we should also take account of the economic and socio-economic policy aspects in the re-assessment of what we refer to as the social and employment policy."
"Finally, I would ask the Commissioner or the Council why the Social Security Directive has not, to date, been reviewed."
"I have seen the annotated agenda and cannot make out any progress."
"I wonder when this will happen when we talk about flexibility on the one hand and social security on the other."
"Commissioner, I feel that there is not much point in constantly referring back to the Lisbon objectives if our goal is to define at European level and, most importantly, at national level, action plans and legislative measures to create an environment which will encourage firms' competitiveness, particularly in this period, and thus create the right conditions for high-quality employment."
"In my opinion, there are a number of things we should do - and we can choose whether or not to do them - at national level."
"Here are a few considerations."
"I feel, for example, that the constant focus on the action of the social partners is not just excessive but is in danger of leading us along a path which will increase the rigidity of the labour market, the path of protecting workers and firms that are already part of the production cycle and providing them with guarantees, safeguards and opportunities, in other words protecting those inside the labour market and the economy and thus creating greater barriers for those outside the market, those who need it most, those who are seeking work."
"As regards intracommunity mobility - and I feel this is an important goal - I believe that we must concentrate on creating the right conditions for effective access to this mobility."
"I would point out, however, that there are mobility problems within the Community and within the individual countries, and I am thinking here of Italy, for example, where there is extremely little, if any, labour mobility within the country because of labour market legislation, because of national collective agreements - and I hope that nobody is going to propose European collective agreements for the different sectors of the labour market - agreements which do not recognise specific situations or even the different benefits that the individual areas might present for an efficient labour market; we therefore need to create worker mobility but also investment mobility."
"Another aspect of the same subject is the mobility of professional labour and professional categories of workers."
"Many countries such as Italy have a corporative system for regulating the professions, which makes access impossible since the partners would be bound to the corporations and creates a legislative barrier to mobility, for example to access in Italy for those who wish to exercise some of the most important liberal professions."
"I believe that we must reflect on this issue, and we must also reflect on the fact that it might be better for Europe to concentrate on the need for a constant increase in the role of the social partners rather than trying to introduce the most effective market rules possible."
"Madam President, allow me first to address a query to Mr Frederiksen, who chaired his first Social Affairs Council yesterday."
"I have been informed, to my great surprise, that it was impossible to reach agreement on the tripartite social dialogue summit during that meeting, and in my view, one of the very things that are important in the employment strategy and that we must try to promote is to involve the social partners in this employment strategy based on their responsibility in wage-base determination and working conditions policy."
"I should like to express my great astonishment and sadness at this and ask him why no agreement could be reached."
"I should like to make two comments on the report by Mr Bushill-Matthews, who has for the second time drafted a report of this kind on this annual report and whose shadow rapporteur I have now been for the second time."
"I am also a little surprised at the fact that the report features on the agenda of this plenary meeting, since we tried very hard to reach agreement within the committee on a number of important points."
"I have two observations to make in this connection."
"Firstly, with regard to the JEVs, that is, the joint ventures with the accession countries, I fully endorse what Mrs Gill has said on the subject, namely that it is important to analyse carefully why that project is running so badly, whether this is indeed due to the publicity, the bureaucracy and long-winded administrative procedures, and whether it is not regrettable to mess up a project of this kind if there is a possibility that the procedures might be improved."
"I should like to ask the Commission to pay particular attention to matters of this kind during this assessment, because I believe that it could in itself present a very important opportunity to promote entrepreneurship and cooperation."
"My final point concerns Mr Bushill-Matthews' report."
"I should like to briefly draw attention to the request that has also been included in his report to obtain a report from the Commission about corporate social responsibility and the SME."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Bastos' excellent report highlights the dual necessity to integrate Eures into the Member States' employment services and to involve local authorities and the social partners in the activities of Eures so as to bring about ever-increasing decentralisation of labour mobility initiatives."
"It will thus be possible to enhance and extend cross-border cooperation in training, the recognition of qualifications and the protection of pension rights, to which the social partners have made a decisive contribution with the promotion by Eures of at least 39 interregional trade union councils in the territories bordering on the States of Europe."
"This experience must be exploited and must certainly not go to waste, which is what would happen if the interregional trade union councils were detached from Eures and their existence and the funding of their activities somehow made dependent on the goodwill of each individual Union State, as would appear to be the intention of the Commission."
"The need for greater involvement of the Member States in the funding and running of Eures and the associated structures is certainly something we support, but the form and extent of this involvement can only be defined at Community level and involve all the Member States jointly and severally: in other words, it must not lead to the Commission casting off its responsibility for the running or even the continued existence of the interregional trade union councils."
"We have therefore tabled an amendment before the House with the consent of the rapporteur, Mrs Bastos, which proposes that the Commission and the Council be asked for reassurance on this point."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Bastos on this exhaustive report on a subject - mobility - which is so important, so crucial for a Europe which is hoping to achieve greater competitiveness through the creation of new, higher-quality jobs."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Commission's Action Plan, which contains practical measures for creating a more favourable environment for the European labour market by 2005, making it more open and accessible for all."
"I am pleased to find included a number of recommendations which I and Mr Evans made two years ago in our report on mobility within the Community, in particular the mobility of students, people undergoing training and people doing voluntary work as well as teachers and researchers."
"Then, last but certainly not least, there is a special section which deals with the mobility of people with disabilities."
"We need to go further, however."
"If, indeed, we want a Europe with more and higher-quality jobs, with greater social cohesion - in other words, if we want to achieve the ambitious but necessary Lisbon objectives - it is essential that we continue to concentrate on eliminating once and for all those barriers which still exist, restricting the professional and geographical mobility of the European citizens and, indeed, limiting their potential."
"We cannot afford to let this absurd situation continue any longer. It is easier for money, goods and services to move within the European Union than the European citizens themselves."
"Consider the strategic role of the local authorities, the opportunities provided by teleworking and the need to modernise and fully exploit the potential of the Eures system. This is something I stressed in my report on the Sixth Framework-Programme for Research too."
"We therefore need to update and simplify coordination of social security once and for all, speed up revision of Regulation No 1408/71 and address and resolve together the complex issue of supplementary pensions."
"A key issue, then, which Mr Zappalà is currently addressing in committee, is that of academic and vocational qualifications and the mutual recognition thereof. We must, at last, achieve that European area of qualifications which will complete the reform of the internal market, increasing mobility between the different Member States of the Union considerably."
"I should like to express my thanks for the many sound contributions during this debate."
"I agree with Commissioner Diamantopoulou that, following yesterday's Council meeting, we now have a common platform for revising the Common Employment Strategy."
"I also agree that we must use this platform as the basis for a broad debate on future employment in the EU."
"Let there be no doubt that the debate is open to all players and that the role of the European Parliament in this debate is absolutely crucial."
"I should also like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his observations to the effect that we must create jobs in practice."
"It is in this area that the European Employment Strategy must be put to the test and demonstrate its worth."
"I should also like to express my thanks for the many practical proposals contributed by Mr Bushill-Matthews for promoting employment in Europe and increasing flexibility in the European labour markets."
"I am also keen to stress, as several other speakers have done, that the two sides of industry must take an active part in the process."
"They must feel that they own the process and so feel an obligation to participate."
"I know that the basic conditions for doing so vary from one Member State to another, but it is on a day-to-day basis that the results are to be achieved, and I am pleased that the Commission and Parliament are emphasising this."
"I think I have unfortunately to say to Mrs van den Burg that she has misunderstood the outcome of yesterday's Council meeting."
"I agree completely that the social dialogue and the tripartite summit are important, which is why we scheduled these matters for discussion over lunch at yesterday's Council meeting, where it was agreed that we should establish a tripartite social dialogue summit."
"We shall therefore try to have this endorsed at the next Council meeting."
"I should like to say to Mr Herman Schmid that, in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, I cannot at this time present practical models for closer cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, but we look forward to hearing this matter discussed and to having the practical options and proposals on the table over the next few months."
"I want to say to Mr Bouwman that we in the Council should very much like to see the various socio-political directives revised."
"One of the things I would point out is that the current modernisation of EEC Regulation 1408/71 on social security schemes for employed persons moving within the Community is on the agenda of the Council's December meeting."
"I should also like to thank Mr Andersson for his contribution."
"We are in complete agreement on a great many matters."
"We must be focused in our approach and see to it that matters are implemented in such a way that there is democratic scrutiny of all our efforts."
"I should again like to emphasise that, for the people of Europe, it is the results that count."
"When all is said and done, an increase in prosperity is conditional upon those who are unemployed obtaining jobs."
"People must get off passive welfare and into work."
"New jobs must be created, and the business climate must promote the creation of new, and more, jobs."
"That is, and remains, the main task."
"We must debate the future Employment Strategy now and over the next few months and, as Mr Herman Schmid stated, we must arrange for the national strategies to fit in with the European strategies, for it is in this area that we can reap the considerable benefits of our combined efforts to promote employment."
"I would thank the representatives of the Council and the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is a joint debate on:"
"? Recommendation (A5-0299/2002) by Mr Obiols i Germà, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States of the one part, and the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria of the other part (10819/2002 - C5-0362/2002 - 2002/0077(AVC)), and"
"? oral questions (B5-0255/2002 and B5-0256/2002) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to the Council and Commission, on the conclusion of an association agreement with Algeria."
"Madam President, Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Cohn-Bendit, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to table the question here and also to make a number of comments on behalf of our rapporteur - if he is not here - on the conclusion of an association agreement with Algeria."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs did not make things easy for itself in this respect."
"We therefore also postponed our decision until we were able to hold a discussion with the Algerian Foreign Minister, to whom we put questions on a wide range of issues, notably concerning compliance with key aspects of this agreement and especially the clauses on human rights and democracy."
"This is also an important question for the Council and the Commission."
"How much confidence is there that these provisions will be complied with?"
"Under Article 2 of the agreement, and with the involvement of this Parliament, it should after all be guaranteed that importance is attached in future to ensuring that such clauses do not simply remain abstract elements of these agreements but form part of an operational policy designed to make sure that appropriate developments genuinely take place in such countries."
"I believe that it is in our common interest that we should have peaceful and democratic development, based on the rule of law, throughout the Mediterranean region, and therefore also in Algeria."
"This is why it is right for these relations to be developed in order to enforce such positions."
"In this context, the Council and the Commission must use all the instruments to ensure that the death penalty is abolished, that genuine cooperation is established in the fight against terrorism, and that progress is made on issues relating to decentralised decision-making structures, taking account of the different conditions within the country, and in particular, to ensure that progress is made on economic and social development which deprives terrorism of its breeding-ground."
"I believe that these are key tasks, which should be tackled on the basis of this agreement so that it can become a genuinely useful instrument."
"In this context, it is naturally also of interest to us to find out, in view of the European Union's policies, to what extent free movement of persons can genuinely be developed in this area, and, furthermore, how issues such as asylum policy can be dealt with."
"In particular, of course, we are keen to hear why inter-parliamentary relations do not merit a single mention in this new agreement."
"I believe that if we wish to promote democratic development in any country, it is extremely important to support parliamentary developments in an appropriate way in order, on the basis of inter-parliamentary dialogue, to set in train a mutual learning process and strengthen a country's democratic development."
"I would be pleased if the Council and Commission could answer this question."
"In particular, I am interested in hearing how the current Treaty can be used to promote this development, irrespective of what the Treaty says."
"For these reasons, I would like to ask everyone to vote for this agreement."
"In line with the resolutions which we have tabled in this House, however, we intend to monitor the implementation of this agreement on an ongoing basis and look very carefully at what you, the Council and the Commission, are doing, so that we ensure that our notions of democracy and human rights, as well as the joint campaign against terrorism, can flow into a progressively positive common policy."
"On this, I ask for your support!"
"Madam President, might I be permitted to emphasise that the signing of the association agreement really has signified a turning point and opened a new chapter in our relations with Algeria."
"It is the Council's view that the signing of this agreement clearly shows that, in order to stimulate trade and investment, the Algerian authorities have a desire to maintain and step up their efforts on behalf of the necessary reform process."
"That ought also to find expression in political and social reforms."
"A clear signal is also being sent to investors to the effect that Algeria undertakes to create a constructive environment for international enterprises."
"It is primarily a question of intergovernmental relations, but the agreement also provides a framework for the commercial world and civil society."
"The agreement is also of significance for the EU's entire Mediterranean policy, and it is a further step towards setting up a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area."
"The purpose of the agreement is also to promote that sub-regional cooperation between the Mediterranean partners themselves that is so important to a positive outcome of the Barcelona process."
"The association agreement contains an article on the movement of persons, and the EU has in this way pledged to look into the possibility of simplifying and speeding up the procedures for issuing visas to certain persons."
"This provision must find expression in the implementation rules for the agreement."
"Once the agreement has come into force, the bodies set up under it will have to investigate how it will be possible to implement this pledge concerning visas, taking account of course of the EU's policy at the relevant time."
"With regard to respect for human rights, the Council is monitoring very carefully the issues relating to respect for human rights in Algeria, and specifically within the political dialogue with Algeria that has taken place at ministerial level since 1997."
"In this way, the Council, which is represented in the troika, is given the opportunity regularly to address these issues and vigorously to emphasise that there must be no violation or abuse of human rights, including in connection with combating terrorism."
"The association agreement will now provide greater opportunities for following up this issue and for supporting the Algerian authorities in this connection."
"I would point out that, as is well known, the agreement makes respect for human rights an essential feature forming the basis of the parties' external and internal policies."
"It also provides an institutional framework for regular political dialogue at different levels, and specifically at Association Council level, concerning all subjects of common interest."
"As long as respect for human rights is a problem in Algeria, the issue will be on the agendas of the joint meetings."
"As soon as the agreement has come into force, that will apply both to the political dialogue, established in 1997, and to the bodies concerned with the agreement, namely the Association Council and the Association Committee."
"The Council does not intend to take any steps concerning the situation in Kabylia, for it regards the matter as being in the first place an internal Algerian issue."
"However, the Council looks favourably upon the important decision taken recently to give the Tamazight language the status of a national language."
"In June 2001, the Gothenburg European Council made it an urgent matter generally to call upon all those in responsible positions in Algeria to make efforts to bring the present confrontations and violence to an end."
"It encouraged the authorities to launch a political initiative to solve the crisis with the aid of dialogue between all Algerians."
"The situation remains difficult and complex, however, as may be seen from the low turnout at the parliamentary election on 30 May 2002."
"The October local elections will also be able to provide an important indication of the situation in the region."
"Improvement at the socio-economic level would aid the search for a solution, and we have every desire to help with the efforts aimed at economic reforms."
"We are supporting these by means of the Meda Regulation, providing EUR 240 million for the period 2000-2004, and by means of the loans from the European Investment Bank, amounting to EUR 620 million since 1996."
"Once it has been put in place, the new investment facility should also contribute to improving the economic situation in Algeria."
"According to the association agreement, the Association Council can facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and Algeria's parliamentary institutions, as well as between the Economic and Social Committee and the corresponding body in Algeria."
"I should like to emphasise that the Council takes a positive view of the conclusions of the latest meeting of the parliamentary Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, emphasising the parliamentary dimension of our partnership with the southern Mediterranean countries."
"We are in the process of looking into which cooperation mechanisms can be used for setting up such a Euro-Mediterranean assembly."
"Madam President, the agreement signed by the European Union and Algeria marks the start of a new era in relations between us, and as Mr Brok quite rightly says, Algeria needs Europe and Europe needs Algeria within the context of Euro-Mediterranean collaboration."
"I should like to comment on three important points, in reply to the issues raised by Mr Brok."
"The first relates to the economic and political reforms which this agreement may help, the second relates to people's freedom of movement and the third relates to human rights."
"On the first point, from a political point of view, Algeria decided in 1989 to adopt a constitution allowing a multi-party system."
"At present, democracy is not very well grounded, with political life segregated from civil society."
"Algeria has a duty to improve the situation and, more to the point, to ensure that there is a genuine division between the executive, legislative and judicial powers and transparent ballot counts."
"The political dialogue for which provision is made in the association agreement will provide a valuable framework for exchanging opinions and experience on this issue."
"From an economic point of view, the association agreement allows for the gradual introduction of a single free trade area between Algeria and the European Union and challenges the Algerian Government to make the necessary reforms."
"As stressed in the resolution, it will have to start by satisfying certain basic needs of the people, such as running water, housing and medical care, otherwise it will clearly be unable to push ahead with other reforms because it will not have the consent of the people."
"Similarly, it needs to move and facilitate the move from the present planned economy to a free-market economy."
"This reform was overdue in Algeria anyway, because the suffocating planned economy had reached its limits."
"But now it has an opportunity, helped by this agreement, to adopt economic reforms which, basically, will rectify economic distortions and social inequalities."
"The transition to a free-market economy will require consultations with business associations, with the trades union, and will need to focus on improving the legal framework for business and investment activities, reforming the banking system and stamping out corruption."
"The government recently approved a 7 billion dollar programme along these lines, which covers a great many of these issues."
"Again, the aid provided by the European Union under the MEDA programme will supplement this programme, given its three basic objectives of: one, strengthening the market economy; two, developing human resources, and three, consolidating the rule of law and satisfying certain requirements."
"The second point concerns the free movement of persons."
"Under the agreement, the European Union is charged with finding ways of simplifying the visa procedure, as Mr Frederiksen mentioned, especially for the people involved in implementing it."
"This is a reasonable request on the Algerian side."
"The association agreement cannot concern itself merely with the setting up of a free trade zone; it must also make it easier for people to travel in both directions."
"I should point out that this endeavour relates to legal movements and in no way contradicts the Seville conclusions on stopping illegal immigration."
"The agreement signed is completely in line with the Seville guidelines making provision for specific collaboration on illegal immigration and the repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"The third issue is the human rights clause, which is fundamental to the association procedure."
"The Commission acknowledges that Algeria has experienced tragic terrorist activity over the past ten years and we are giving the Algerian Government all the support we can in its fight against terrorism; but we also believe that the fight against terrorism is no excuse whatsoever for trampling over fundamental freedoms."
"The link to the Barcelona process implies a joint commitment to comply with certain basic democratic rules and values."
"Our main concern in this area is for those whose whereabouts are unknown; there are serious obstacles which need to be overcome both by their families and by non-governmental organisations, who frequently encounter delaying tactics on the part of the authorities."
"I think that the application of the human rights clause can be dealt with both adjectivally and substantially."
"Adjectivally through political dialogue, which needs to be predicated on human rights, and substantially, I would say, by the European Union by using a clearer and more substantive language with fewer evasions."
"One item on the agenda for political dialogue is the question of Kabylie."
"We are hoping to inaugurate a dialogue with representative agencies and we welcome the conciliatory approach taken recently on the question of the official recognition of Tamazight as a national language."
"The European Parliament is willing, as it has already stated, to foster dialogue with the Algerian parliament and this will be vital to exchanges of information, common positions and the interests of both sides."
"Contrary to what is stated in the motion for a resolution, the importance of this is clearly stated in Article 99 of the agreement and the Commission will do its utmost to facilitate this sort of dialogue."
"On a more general note, the Commission wholeheartedly supports Parliament's approval of this association agreement, which must not under any circumstances be seen as a blank cheque for the Algerian Government; it is a way of encouraging it to continue with the political, economic and social reforms it has started, basically in order to better the lot of the Algerian people."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when giving our opinion, according to the recommendations of Mr Obiols, with regard to the proposal for an association agreement with the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, our Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, through the intermediary of its Chairman, Mr Brok, and with the agreement of its bureau, considered it necessary to open the debate that has brought us here today and which will be followed, tomorrow, by the adoption of a resolution that I hope will be voted for by a very large majority of this House."
"This step, which, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, has just enabled us to obtain the answers we were waiting for in response to our main questions, must in no way be interpreted as an attempt to interfere in Algeria's domestic affairs, particularly as a mark of disrespect towards Algerian culture and identity."
"On the contrary, it falls within the scope of Parliament's commitment, recalled here by Mr Obiols, to establishing a privileged partnership with the Maghreb countries based on mutual respect and increased awareness of our common destiny."
"That was the aim of the own-initiative report on the Arab Maghreb Union, for which Mr Cohn-Bendit and I were co-rapporteurs, which was adopted by a very large majority in this House before the summer."
"With regard to this debate, I would now like to emphasise three points that have already been partially raised."
"The first is that timetabling clashes mean we are delivering our opinion on the same day that local elections, which are crucial for the future, are taking place in Algeria as you mentioned, President-in-Office of the Council."
"We must hope that these elections contribute to achieving peace, and do not, as some fear today, particularly in Kabylia, give rise to further outbreaks of violence which would serve as pretexts for further repression."
"The second point is that, among the anticipated consequences of the conclusion of this agreement, we firmly hope that aid from the European Union will provide a solution to one of the main difficulties in this country, namely the problem of youth unemployment and the resulting frustrations."
"In this regard, President-in-Office of the Council, you spoke of the need to increase investment and you invited Europeans to invest."
"In fact, we believe that this is one of the very important areas in which the agreement should allow us to demonstrate our commitment."
"Today, however, we draw the attention of the Algerian authorities to the fact that, for European investors, the formalities that must currently be fulfilled with a view to approval are probably a little too bureaucratic and can sometimes be discouraging."
"I have already said this to our Algerian counterparts when I met them last week, but I would like to repeat it today."
"The third point is that we must hope this agreement will help to develop and strengthen regional cooperation - and you mentioned that as well, President-in-Office of the Council - and that it will therefore contribute to kick-starting the process of constituting the Arab Maghreb Union, a process which today is unfortunately at a standstill in the absence of any prospect of a political solution to the problem of the Western Sahara."
"Also on this point, I believe it would be useful to ask the Algerian authorities to pay the utmost attention to finding a solution that allows all the parties concerned to save face, by means, naturally, of the necessary compromises."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot remain indifferent in the face of the current situation in Algeria."
"On the contrary, it should make us more committed to making a clear assessment of the current state of the country and to helping the Algerian people to overcome their difficulties."
"That is why I am giving my full support to the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement that has been presented to us for our agreement today."
"I believe it is along the right lines for four main reasons."
"This is part of the very rationale behind the process opened in Barcelona, encouraging Euro-Mediterranean dialogue."
"This agreement will facilitate regional integration and in particular the Arab Maghreb Union, which we are hoping for with all our might."
"This agreement sends a strong signal of the solidarity of European citizens with the Algerian people."
"And in particular, this agreement should support Algeria in its efforts to achieve openness, reforms and modernisation."
"That is the most important thing."
"In this context, I am pleased to see the broad consensus within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in favour of the proposed measures."
"Nevertheless, our agreement must not be interpreted as giving the Algerian authorities carte blanche."
"We must remain vigilant on the subject of human rights, democracy and good governance."
"These fundamental values are the very cornerstone of the European Union and must be respected as a prerequisite for the correct implementation of the agreement."
"That is why Parliament's motion for a resolution, which recalls these requirements, is along the right lines and should be given the utmost consideration."
"Please allow me to add that, as a Frenchwoman, I am particularly aware of the difficulties that the Algerian people has suffered for so long. The suffering of this country has gone on long enough."
"We all need to take urgent action to find concrete solutions."
"The association agreement will contribute to this if we are able to give objective consideration to Algeria's real problems."
"Madam President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, we have discussed this matter for quite some time in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, with reports and hearings."
"Most of us have also had bilateral contact with a number of representatives of Algeria."
"We have done all of this not only because we take this issue seriously, but also because there are many issues concerning Algeria which need to be dealt with."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is particularly concerned about the human rights situation."
"We know that serious human rights violations are being committed in Algeria."
"Torture and persecution of opponents are unfortunately not unusual, and there are many reports of abuses by military and paramilitary groups."
"Thousands of citizens have disappeared, and it is worrying that the Algerian authorities have not permitted UN observers to investigate this situation."
"The situation in Kabylia is still desperate, and peaceful demonstrators have been killed."
"Much remains to be done in Algeria in the domains of freedom of the press, freedom of association and the establishment of the rule of law."
"The country also has a terrorism problem."
"These issues are described very well and in great detail in Mr Brok's resolution."
"It also points out the need for a regular follow-up of the way in which human rights are being observed, for scrutiny and for interparliamentary dialogue."
"The Liberal Group has made constructive efforts to contribute to this resolution."
"It is therefore with some surprise and disappointment that we note that the Christian Democrats have put forward a number of amendments which considerably dilute the resolution."
"If these amendments are adopted, we believe that the resolution will not have the required force or constitute the complement to the recommendation by Mr Obiols i Germà that is so important."
"The Liberal Group would vote against the resolution."
"It would be a shame if these points disappeared, because it is very important to put pressure on the Algerian Government."
"The association agreement is important for Algeria."
"In spite of the agreement's shortcomings, we believe that Europe has to help Algeria to build up its economic, political and democratic institutions."
"As has been pointed out, the agreement constitutes an extremely important part of the Barcelona process."
"Madam President, by way of conclusion I wish to address a few words to the Commission."
"What is the significance of Article 2 of the association agreement: the human rights clause?"
"We have discussed it many, many times, but it has never been acted upon."
"What is so terribly difficult about finding mechanisms for temporarily or, if necessary, permanently breaking off cooperation, with reference to Article 2, when serious human rights violations are carried out?"
"If we do not lead from the front on this issue, we will actually make ourselves look ridiculous, and we risk not being taken seriously in the field of foreign policy."
"If so, all our talk of a human rights dimension in foreign policy will be nothing but resoundingly empty words."
"Madam President, of course this agreement is not the result of an extensive process of participation and negotiation between all the main players from both sides."
"Consequently, it is what it is."
"Our support, however, for the challenge of forging lasting political relations between both sides of the Mediterranean is unstinting, and we also hope that the Algerian crisis can emerge from behind closed doors where it has tragically played out for too long."
"We would therefore like to take up the challenge of shared development."
"Mr Morillon, I am going to put your mind at ease, please be reassured: we are not interfering when we talk of the democratic deficit and of the importance of supporting the development of freedom in this country."
"The report of the Arab States office of the United Nations Development Programme says this itself."
"It is therefore not a matter of interference at all."
"Democracy is the foundation of development in all its forms."
"However, in order to meet this challenge, in order to take up this challenge of shared development, we must begin by not adding confusion to the chaos in Algeria."
"Certainly, this agreement must not give the authorities free rein."
"In order to avoid this, it is necessary to very clearly acknowledge that, today, it is practically indecent to deny that the violence that has blighted Algeria for more than ten years is down to groups of all kinds, and when I say all kinds, clearly I am also talking about military security groups."
"This has to be said!"
"Paramilitary groups. This has to be written!"
"Mr Habib Souaidia, who is present here today along with other friends whom I would like to greet, was accused of slander by General Nezzar."
"Mr Souaidia said that the generals, who are the real politicians and decision-makers, have killed thousands of people for no reason at all."
"The case brought by Mr Nezzar was thrown out."
"Will we have just the merest fraction of the courage of this Algerian lieutenant?"
"I believe that we should start by acknowledging in our resolution the suffering and tragedy, the hundreds of thousands who have died and the thousands who have disappeared."
"Secondly, our resolution must clearly call for the lifting of the state of emergency which is a real denial of freedom, and the public authorities with whom we negotiate, by declaring this state of emergency, have even let their prerogatives lapse, under the guise of military power."
"How can we accept this?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this association agreement with Algeria comes at the right time and I also believe that it has become urgent since Algeria is finally struggling to emerge from a lengthy dark period in which it has found itself as a result of an ongoing attempt to destabilise it, comparable to the situation affecting all oil-rich countries across the world."
"A foreign, imperialist attack that, as elsewhere, used Islamic extremism for geopolitical ends, which we have been too short-sighted to see."
"Mrs Boumediene-Thiery brought up the main issue a moment ago when she reminded us of the United States' desire to get its hands on Algeria's mineral resources."
"The Algerian Government passed the test victorious in spite of its isolation and timidity, I would even say faintheartedness, for which European aid is chiefly to blame."
"In order for this association to be successful, it must not be limited to good intentions, or just to vague, exclusively economic, free trade agreements."
"It must also be a political association."
"In other words, we must get used to addressing all global political issues together with our Mediterranean partners."
"Furthermore, this is a prerequisite for the Mediterranean to remain at the centre of the world stage; unless this condition is met, we might become more African, Mediterranean or European, but have only a minor role to play in the twenty-first century world."
"In order to achieve this, we must clearly go beyond a simple association agreement with Algeria, as with other Maghreb countries, which are our closest allies."
"We need to alter the structure of Europe and leave behind any fantasies of supranationality and federalism so that we can include our Mediterranean neighbours in an expanded European Union, which will clearly make imperial powers see that they are up against a group of countries devoted to the preservation of liberty, that is to say ?"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, the association agreement concluded with Algeria really is a step in the right direction in Euro-Mediterranean relations and towards achieving our common objective, which is to create not just a free trade zone but an area of sustainable development, security and prosperity for all."
"This being so, may I say how delighted I am that the agreement clearly refers to respect for fundamental human rights."
"I am also delighted at the references to promoting the role of women in economic and social development through education, vocational training, better family planning programmes and the media."
"What saddens me, however, is that these references alone will not promote respect for women's rights in practice and that no reference to this issue was made either by the President-in-Office or by you, Commissioner, who are a champion of women's rights and have nailed your flag to the mast of respect for the principle of equality in the Community's foreign relations."
"I should like to remind you that, in its resolution on the report on respect for women's rights in Euro-Mediterranean relations, the European Parliament called for an express provision on protection for women's rights and, at the same time, called for provision to be made for a protection monitoring policy similar to that applied to candidate countries."
"I should therefore like to take this opportunity to voice my disappointment, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, at the sidelining of this issue and to salute the Commissioner's words, her optimistic words, about the association agreement not being a blank cheque for Algeria."
"We would like the European Commission to set up mechanisms to monitor and evaluate progress and for the Algerian Government to be required, as should happen with all association agreements, to demonstrate the necessary political will to bring about the legislative, administrative and other reforms needed in order to anchor equal opportunities between men and women in the law and include gender mainstreaming in all its policies."
"In the same vein, we want to support Mr Brok's proposal on combating and condemning violence against women and, as condemnation never suffices, we want to impose a strategy inspired by the experience and successes of strategies in the European Union and the candidate countries to combat violence."
"In the same vein, I should like to condemn the absence of the role of women and women's organisations from the proposed regional collaboration."
"This, at the very least, is one area where provision should be made to strengthen civil society and work with women's organisations."
"Madam President, I think that, this evening, we all welcome the fact that we have reached a key point in relations between the European Union and Algeria."
"It is a key point because the situation in Algeria has been extraordinarily troubled for at least a decade."
"It has experienced, inter alia, a period of relative isolation in terms of international relations, particularly relations with Europe, not least in that there is a connection between Algeria and the African dimension and it is important that this aspect of relations is strengthened too."
"I would like to place this report precisely in the context of the partnership."
"The agreement is actually an instrument, it is not a concession granted by Europe, by the European Union, to Algeria, for we too benefit from the agreement - we must never forget that - and it is an instrument which unites, an instrument based on a vision of partnership."
"What does this mean?"
"It means that we need to exploit all the possibilities, both as regards Algerian society - which we could say may be stifling both its economic potential and its human resources potential - and as regards ourselves."
"I would like to draw the Commission's attention to a number of points."
"You set great store by the Agadir process set up between the countries which have concluded association agreements with us."
"You ought to focus equally on the Maghreb dimension of the partnership, for, as we all know, the borders are closed between Morocco and Algeria, and if Europe does not help to increase cooperation between neighbours I do not know what its mission is."
"Lastly, I feel that it is important to place the emphasis on human rights - as other Members have done - and on the elections."
"I would like to say to the Algerian authorities that something important is happening in Kabylia: a party which did not take part in the political elections has presented itself at the administrative elections."
"This is important because it repairs a deep institutional divide which had become established."
"We have witnessed a period when, for example, relations between the police and the people of Kabylia were non-existent."
"It would be a shame if, during the elections, the police authorities were to create problems once again rather than protecting the people and assuring the smooth running of the electoral process, which is extremely important."
"It is therefore absurd to make a comparison between Algeria and the candidate countries, for we are not granting Algeria accession to the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, let us be quite clear about that."
"The greater the consideration that the Union gives to these countries, the greater the benefits it might derive from relations too."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President, I am happy to be closing this discussion."
"I would just like to say to my good friend Philippe Morillon, 'Philippe, you are wrong."
"All your amendments are misguided."
"And I believe that you should think about them tonight and withdraw these amendments as soon as you wake up tomorrow."
"Most of them have already been withdrawn?"
"Well then, withdraw the rest!"
"We will all be happy!'"
"Why?"
"Because it is obvious that we must exercise our right to intervene."
"The Algerians exercise this right to interfere in our affairs when they say that our immigration policy is not right, that they do not have enough visas, etc. They have the right to participate in European discussions."
"If there is an association agreement, then we have not only the right but also the duty to intervene when massacres are committed."
"We must condemn massacres, whether they are committed by Islamic terrorists, paramilitary terrorists or other terrorists linked to some armed service."
"We do not have the right to allow the Algerian embassy to dictate resolutions or amendments to us."
"That is not our role."
"Here our role is to establish an association agreement, on the one hand, and on the other, to intervene politically in discussions in Algeria, so that Algeria can emerge as a democracy."
"And this is not just the fault of colonialism, though colonialism does have its faults."
"Algeria has a single party tradition."
"Algeria has a tradition of military power where the military stands above society and it is the military that commits both good and evil acts."
"This has to change and it is exactly what we are trying to say in the resolution tabled by your colleague Mr Brok, and which many Members voted for."
"And I ask that tomorrow we change nothing in this resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy which is not a resolution of the left, but a resolution by Mr Brok, a member of the PPE-DE."
"Let us adopt this resolution."
"Let us vote for it as it stands and we will all be happy."
"In connection with this debate, I have received a motion for a resolution submitted in accordance with Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The next item is the Commission declaration on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire."
"Madam President, it is slightly difficult to speak on this resolution because as yet it has not been translated and brought up to the office."
"I have to work on the basis of the French version and I just hope I get it right."
"It is tragic that once again we find ourselves standing in this Chamber talking about yet another war in sub-Saharan Africa."
"It is absolutely right that we voice our displeasure at such an action having taken place."
"It is true to say that the election was disappointing and that we had hoped for better results."
"It reflected on the problems of Ivoirian birthright - as to whether you should be allowed to stand as a president if you were born in the country or if your parents were Ivoirian."
"We should always remember, however, that everything concerning our relations with these developing countries is based on the Cotonou Accord. That, of course, gives us a basis for democracy, human rights and good governance."
"Quite honestly, good governance to me is almost more important than pure democracy because if you can get a stable country that is transparent in its doings then that is a big step."
"Côte d'Ivoire is a huge country with enormous potential and is one of the lynchpins in West Africa."
"This was very much an internal power struggle."
"There are those who blame outside influences or rebel groups from other nations, but this was a pure power struggle within the nation itself. It was an issue of people wanting to take power simply as a domestic issue."
"The problem is much the same as that experienced by Nigeria in that there is a very strong Muslim presence in the north of the country, and a Christian one in the south."
"There is always a vying between these two groups."
"As it happens, the Muslims in the north tend to be the poorer of the two groups."
"The Commission should focus aid onto this area to benefit the Muslims who have not got the wealth of the south."
"I was in Ghana two weekends ago when the ECOWAS meeting of the 14 West African states took place."
"They discussed the situation in the Côte d'Ivoire."
"There was real doom and gloom amongst the representatives and leaders of those countries."
"When things go wrong in a country of that size, it not only destabilises Côte d'Ivoire, it very much destabilises that whole region."
"Therefore I was delighted that at least the ECOWAS leaders had the foresight and sense to intervene in the situation in Côte d'Ivoire and send a delegation there in the hope that it could mediate between the two parties."
"I sincerely hope that they are successful because there are problems arising in Nigeria where exactly the same situation exists."
"That country has a strong fundamentalist Muslim north and a Christian group in the south."
"With the way the Commission is now moving towards regional policies, it is absolutely vital that we get these countries to understand that if they are going to be able to face global prospects as far as trade is concerned, they must pull together as a region."
"Therefore it is vitally important that they support each other."
"The one disappointment was that NEPAD, the new African partnership on development, has not reacted more strongly in this situation."
"Written into that new agreement was a peer review."
"I had hoped that when a problem like this arose, the Heads of States in African countries in that organisation, which has been set up by Africans to look after Africa, would have immediately stepped in."
"But unfortunately, as with the Zimbabwean situation, they have not done so."
"If this organisation has not fallen at the first fence then it has certainly stumbled."
"I sincerely hope preparatory talks can take place as soon as possible because only around a table can we bring this conflict to an end without the death and destruction that usually happens."
"All I can do is ask the Commission to press both parties to stop warring and come together for discussions."
"Madam President, since the coup d'état on 19 September, the whole of the northern territory of Côte d'Ivoire has been plunged into confused military conflict."
"Military operations are being carried out even as I speak and fighting is raging in Bouaké, leading us to fear the worst for the civil population caught up in the conflict."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we fear for the people of Côte d'Ivoire who have been taken hostage by factions and who are paying for this crisis with their freedom and, in some cases, their lives."
"We fear for Côte d'Ivoire, which is in danger of becoming further removed from the model for which it is so often admired."
"Today, Côte d'Ivoire and its society are being torn apart, and we fear for Africa and the African people for the whole region may collapse, and this is a region which has already seen too many wars and human tragedies and where armed gangs are rampant and trafficking of all kinds is rife - these are both distressing everyday realities."
"This is an outcome which does not, in fact, seem too far removed from the current instability in Côte d'Ivoire."
"If Côte d'Ivoire becomes destabilised, this will lay the foundations for a crisis similar to that in the Great Lakes region or in the Congo, which have for many years been devastating the heart of the continent."
"We are concerned by this crisis, and we are saddened by it."
"We are also surprised by it too, however."
"It is happening at the very time when the efforts made by Laurent Gbagbo's regime to deal with two of the country's greatest challenges were paying off."
"The first challenge is national reconciliation and, to promote this, a broad forum was organised in 2001 and a government of national union was formed, bringing together the major political forces following the elections in July 2002."
"The next challenge is economic and social revival, promoted through fundamental social reforms such as free schooling or health insurance for all citizens."
"In order to make further progress on these fronts, however, Côte d'Ivoire needs peace."
"Europe must exert pressure to bring about a negotiated solution and a peaceful resolution to the crisis."
"It must make every effort to mediate and must welcome the actions carried out under the aegis of the ECOWAS."
"These attempts have so far failed, but it is indeed difficult to ask a legitimate government to negotiate as equals with armed rebels."
"The challenge now is to preserve the unity of the whole territory of Côte d'Ivoire whilst respecting constitutional law."
"We must be particularly careful to ensure that, if an intervention force is sent to Côte d'Ivoire, this does not lead to a de facto division of the country."
"The Socialist Group also supports the idea of sending a parliamentary mission - I am addressing my fellow Members here - to give our support to the democratically elected institutions and to go and meet with the various political forces in Côte d'Ivoire."
"In order, however, to help democracy take root in Côte d'Ivoire, President Gbagbo must very swiftly take the initiative of launching negotiations with all the political and social forces in his country."
"Negotiations must, in particular, focus on the constitutional bottlenecks which are acting as a brake, slowing down national reconciliation."
"The 2000 Constitution does not fulfil this requirement, it does not allow all the different political positions to express themselves and it once again and still prevents Mr Ouatara from standing as presidential candidate."
"It does not provide for the possibility of dissolving the National Assembly in the event of major crises, and this may leave the way open for an extremely violent political reaction."
"Lastly, President Gbagbo must resume dialogue in order to pursue an unqualified and unambiguous effort to achieve national reconciliation, which is essential for a country that has been torn apart for many years by the manipulation of the concept of Ivorian birthright, almost 30% of whose population is made up of foreigners."
"In this respect, the call for the expulsion of 500 000 inhabitants originating from Burkina Faso, broadcast last Sunday on Côte d'Ivoire national television, is an unacceptable abuse and must be vehemently condemned, in the same way that the attacks on foreigners who live in the country must be vehemently condemned."
"Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, today, Côte d'Ivoire and the legitimate government of Laurent Gbagbo need the firm support of the European Union that you have outlined and which I shall promote very firmly and in every possible way."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I welcome the Commission's statement here today, which is actually more balanced than our draft resolution."
"I also note with interest that the Commissioner made specific reference to the RDR, which is the Liberals' sister party in Côte d'Ivoire."
"We have attempted to maintain contact with the party, but recently, of course, that has not been possible."
"I am very disappointed at the part the EU has played in this matter."
"In April, I asked the Council what measures were being taken to aid the functioning of the National Reconciliation Forum and what measures were envisaged for monitoring the elections in June 2002."
"At that time, it was said that the EU certainly was concerned about the fact that the 2000 elections were characterised by violence, infringements of human rights and exclusion of some major political parties, and talks were held pursuant to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The talks were, however, brought to a close in June 2001, and it was not thought possible to make any particularly significant contribution to the supervision of the elections, or to provide support, or to play an active role."
"Many people in the region are suffering because we remained passive and did not take a more active role."
"This is a shame, because this is an area in which the EU could have been active, and we were aware of these issues."
"We are concerned about the troubles spreading out in the region."
"As usual, there is a great risk that women and children will bear the brunt of the suffering."
"We know that the position of children in Côte d'Ivoire is not as it should be."
"The Liberals will not support item 5 of the resolution, and my colleague Mr Van Hecke will go into more detail on this matter."
"Madam President, supporting President Laurent Gbagbo is, ladies and gentlemen, natural."
"It is natural to support a politician for whom prison, exile and suffering have marked the thirty-year long struggle for his ideas."
"In two years, he has restored to Côte d'Ivoire a minimum rule of law, revitalised the education system, gained the trust of the international institutions and above all, provided conditions for national reconciliation by forming a government made up of all the opposition parties, and I would point out to Mrs Thors that the RDR (Rassemblement des Républicains) party entered the government in August 2002."
"Parliament invited President Gbagbo to Strasbourg in November 2001 - Nicole Fontaine invited him - and, in doing so, wanted to acknowledge the work carried out by this humanist professor and leader."
"We must help him because he symbolises republican legality, because he symbolises political change in an Africa that is greatly in need of it, because he is the symbol that Africa is anchored in a modern democracy."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, a ceasefire is needed, but on the condition that the rebels surrender their weapons."
"No constitutionally elected president can negotiate with armed rebels that occupy 40% of his country."
"The European Union must help in the general reconstruction of the country, which will involve the development of the rule of law, a programme of social housing for the most deprived, and the reorganisation of the Côte d'Ivoire army."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if Côte d'Ivoire falters, the whole of West Africa will be permanently destabilised, it will be plunged into chaos, and there will be terrible risks of ethnic and religious clashes."
"We must therefore, as part of an active diplomatic effort, send a parliamentary mission, and this is what we shall begin working on, Madam President, as of tomorrow."
"As Commissioner Barnier wished, quite rightly and quite appropriately, this parliamentary mission must be able to arrive within three days in Abidjan and it must strive, on the basis of the resolution that we shall vote upon tomorrow, to play a role and provide Parliament with a role to play."
"It is no good arriving when the crisis is over."
"We have an essential responsibility towards this country, its president and the people of Côte d'Ivoire."
"They need our solidarity, Madam President, in the terrible ordeal they are going through, and the European Parliament must therefore have a presence and its presence must be firm."
"Madam President, recent events, marked by a number of assassinations in Côte d'Ivoire, are extremely worrying."
"The military uprising against the current official government is unjustifiable, despite the worsening economic and political conditions."
"The unprecedented economic crisis, related to the fall in the price of raw materials, and particularly of coffee and cotton, has caused further hardship and poverty in the country."
"It is also clear, however, that the lack of respect for the concept of Ivorian birthright, which came to a head during the presidential elections in 2000, has served only to intensify the climate of hate and violence in the country, and the accusations that neighbouring countries are supporting the rebels could be used to justify the persecution of the immigrant civilian populations."
"In this respect, we must welcome the statement made by President Gbagbo which calls for foreigners to be protected."
"It should also be taken on board by his troops."
"The risk of an outbreak of xenophobia among civilians is indeed great."
"We must avoid being caught up in a civil war between ethnic groups, a crisis situation similar to that in the Congo, which would be extremely dangerous and regrettable for Côte d'Ivoire and all its inhabitants."
"Therefore, although we may lament the failure of mediation efforts by the ECOWAS which proposed the resumption of negotiations between the government and the rebels, the intervention forces should not impose an actual division of ethnic groups on the ground."
"The European Union must support the legitimate government in order to restore the rule of law and to protect the civilian populations, of all ethnic origins."
"In the longer term, a committee of enquiry should be set up in order to discover the causes of these events and to condemn those responsible."
"The European Union must ensure respect for the principles of human rights, of democracy and of political pluralism, but also, and this is crucial, encourage the economic and social development of Côte d'Ivoire."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen representing the Member States, Commissioners, allow me to express my astonishment at the arguments put forward by some of my fellow Members, because, ultimately, the situation in Côte d'Ivoire is so straightforward that we should be in immediate agreement on a number of obvious facts."
"The first obvious fact is that Côte d'Ivoire is one of the States that deserves our most vigorous support, as it is showing numerous encouraging signs: its level of growth stands at 3%, it is making relatively rapid progress towards democracy, illustrated by the presidential elections that have been universally welcomed as a step forward, it has a process for forming political groupings in place which, following the forum for national reconciliation, should lead to fully democratic legislative elections, and the current government must be instructed to arrange these as soon as possible."
"Yes, Côte d'Ivoire and President Gbagbo deserve the support of all the European States that are concerned about links with Africa."
"I do not understand how we can hesitate, unless we are trying to make things worse before they can get better or we are allowing ourselves to be carried away by a feeling of indifference to which I fear many Europeans are certainly tempted to give in but which is unacceptable to France."
"The second obvious fact is that Côte d'Ivoire is in not facing a civil war."
"It is simply battling with a foreign invasion which, although it exploits the age-old oppositions between ethnic groups, as usual, is primarily a matter for geopolitical analysis."
"The so-called insurgents are obviously armed, and powerfully so, by one or more foreign powers."
"An analysis of the situation must not, therefore, be based on ethnographic conclusions, and even less on humanitarian lamentation, but on geopolitical factors."
"Turning to the third obvious fact, which is crucial but, for this reason perhaps, is too often eclipsed, since it is true that the ignorance - or lack of perception - of this House in geopolitical matters is evident in so many areas."
"Today, Africa is, out of all the continents, the one which is the most immune to the influence of the global empire."
"This is due to historical reasons relating to the links that several European nations have forged with Africa and, consequently, due to the fear, which has often stopped Washington, that any destabilisation of regimes would bolster the Soviet Union."
"However, since the collapse of the Russian power, the empire has been trying to extend its influence over this continent, which is both the richest, potentially at least, and, sadly, the most vulnerable of all."
"We tried to do this several times in Equatorial Africa - formerly under Belgian control - and extended these efforts to the neighbouring countries of the Gulf of Guinea, which has such substantial oil reserves."
"We are now benefiting from the ambitions of a personality of uncertain nationality, who, in any case, spent most of his life in the United States, to destabilise a country whose situation has been growing stronger with each passing year and which, as a result, became a major partner of Europe."
"It is this connection, it is this link that some want to destroy."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must be firm regarding the true interests of Europe."
"France has the courage to do this."
"The support that it is giving to the official, democratic government of Côte d'Ivoire must be shown by all Europeans together, because what France is doing in Africa, it is not doing for itself but for the whole of Europe."
"Madam President, the latest conflict in Côte d'Ivoire comes, I believe, as no surprise to those who try constantly to follow the developments in that country."
"Behind it stretches a long history of political, economic and, above all, ethnic stand-offs that continually interweave and reinforce each other."
"The motion for a resolution that is before us overlooks, whether knowingly or unknowingly, the responsibilities of the current leaders."
"Côte d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer of cocoa and one of the most important producers of coffee."
"The country accommodates nearly 5 million immigrants, mainly from the neighbouring countries Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal."
"In times of economic boom, they are deployed as cheap labour; during a political and economic crisis, they are the scapegoats par excellence."
"The xenophobic campaign in the state media was nourished by President Gbagbo's accusations that Burkina Faso was at the root of the mutiny, without there being a shred of evidence."
"Many people in the north of Côte d'Ivoire originally come from Burkina."
"They have the feeling that they are now being treated as second-class citizens, particularly since their leader, Mr Ouattara, was barred from taking part in the presidential elections on account of his alleged Burkinan roots."
"Together with Mr Ouattara, the peoples in the north felt excluded from the political system."
"This is the core of the problem."
"Côte d'Ivoire has been broken as a nation by the political misuse of religious differences and of the concept of Ivoirité."
"The international community has made a huge effort to evacuate French subjects and 200 children of American clergymen."
"I hope that it will display the same level of commitment to prevent even more victims from falling among the civilian population and to prevent the instability in Côte d'Ivoire from degenerating into a regional conflict, the effects of which are incalculable."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank you for having given the Commission the opportunity to open this debate, to take part in it and to provide its own contribution."
"Having listened to their comments very carefully, I would also like to thank the various speakers, virtually all of whom have, in general, simply demonstrated that, with regard to this serious issue, we have a common view of the situation and of the ways to resolve it."
"The House and all of the Union institutions are concerned, not only by the serious and damaging internal consequences that the current crisis situation in Côte d'Ivoire may have, but also by the destabilisation - as several speakers have said - that the crisis could cause throughout the whole region if a peaceful political solution is not found in the very near future."
"Yesterday's televised speech by President Gbagbo calling for an end to the conflict leads us to hope that this peaceful solution will be found very soon in order to prevent unrest in the country and the whole region, which many, including ourselves, fear will happen."
"Let us hope therefore, Madam President, that this debate and our combined efforts - and let us spare no effort - will help to restore lasting peace and silence the weapons in Côte d'Ivoire."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"To conclude this debate, I have received seven motions for resolution tabled on the basis of Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The attempted coup of 19 September has plunged the people of Côte d'Ivoire into utter confusion, and has led to acts of violence such as the demise of the Home Affairs Minister and the death of General Gueï."
"The support expressed by the European Parliament for the democratic institutions of Côte d'Ivoire and its president in the wake of the attempted coup, does not mean that Laurent Gbagbo has been given carte blanche to resolve the situation as he sees fit."
"On the contrary, he must listen and put in place ceasefire agreements called for by the regional ECOWAS mission."
"There can be no military solution to this crisis; the only option that can be contemplated is a political solution involving all opposing parties."
"The Côte d'Ivoire President must now embark on the policy that he made a commitment to follow after his election, the backbone of which was the policy of national reconciliation and the fight against ethnic and religious divisions."
"In the light of events in Côte d'Ivoire, there is a genuine risk of balkanisation and it is feared that the whole region will slide into chaos."
"One quarter of the population of Côte d'Ivoire is made up of immigrants from West Africa, of which some countries, such as Liberia, are engaged in civil war."
"(Written statement abbreviated pursuant to Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0341/2002) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund [COM(2002)514 - C5-0441/2002 - 2002/0228(CNS)]."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to express, at the beginning of the debate, my deep gratitude to the House, and particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Berend, and to Mr Walter, as well as to the chairmen, Mr Caveri and Mr Wynn, for the high level of cooperation between our two institutions and for the speed with which you have examined this proposal for a regulation."
"We must now work as quickly as possible, not least in the area of the budgetary mechanism, so that the first funds can be provided before the winter."
"I would like to be able to provide the first funds in November."
"Given the progress made in discussions within the Council this very afternoon, I feel that we can say that an agreement on this proposal for a regulation is now within reach, and I am pleased to say that this has been made possible thanks to a very broad consensus between Parliament and the Commission, of which Mr Berend was one of the architects."
"During this final stage of discussions, we still have three points to tackle."
"The first is the definition of precisely which disasters will qualify for the provision of compensation."
"Parliament is concerned that the mechanism should not be gripped in the vice of an excessively rigid definition."
"The Council, for its part, wanted to classify natural disasters as priority."
"The Commission, as I said the other day before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, has studied the recent history of disasters in Europe in great detail."
"In recent years 80% of the disasters which have occurred are natural disasters, such as gales, earthquakes or floods."
"I do not believe, therefore, that it is inconsistent to agree to the priority requested by the Council since the option for the Commission to intervene in other similar cases - ecological, environmental or technological disasters - would still be available in a very small number of specific cases."
"The second point concerns the threshold, or thresholds, for drawing on the Fund."
"Like the Commission, this House attaches particular importance to the fact that there are two criteria, either one or the other, and not just one sole criterion, so that we can fairly assess the impact of a disaster on the economy of a State, whether this State is a large State, a large country such as Germany, or a smaller State."
"I am afraid that, as we are quite aware, the smaller States in our Union are at risk of experiencing genuine, serious natural disasters."
"Even though the Council wishes to significantly re-assess the criterion expressed as an absolute value - we had proposed damage estimated at EUR 1 billion, the Council is going no higher than EUR 3 billion - the principle of having two alternative criteria is not being questioned."
"Finally, the third point, is maintaining a qualitative criterion to provide for intervention under exceptional circumstances to help a single region affected by a disaster."
"This is an absolute priority for the Commission, and it is the margin of appreciation that we have sought throughout the discussions."
"The higher the quantitative thresholds, and I have just said that they were increased in the Council proposal, the greater the need to have a margin of appreciation, because, of course, the worst thing that could happen would be, ladies and gentlemen, for this Fund to be so restricted, made so inflexible by very limited qualitative and excessively high quantitative criteria that, ultimately, it is never used."
"I have pointed out, and I reiterate this to the House, that, in 14 years, we have only identified, thank God, seven major disasters with a total amount of damages of more than EUR 1 billion."
"It is also for this reason that I proposed in the Commission's first version to retain the quantitative threshold of EUR 1 billion."
"Once again, the worst thing that could happen would be for the Fund to be so inflexible, bound up in all sorts of criteria, that, once set up, it would never actually be used, even when peoples have been affected by disasters."
"The Council is taking a very careful approach to the qualitative criteria."
"I would like to say here that neither the Commission, nor, I believe, Parliament, wants the functioning of the regulation to be hijacked by the systematic use of this qualitative criterion."
"The Commission wants to be and will be extremely strict in the use of this particular solution."
"What we want is very simply to ensure that victims of a disaster that is exceptionally serious for a single region can qualify for assistance from the Fund."
"Indeed, there are regions in Europe that are more at risk than others, such as islands, isolated or remote regions, or regions that we must protect, as, in fact, the Treaty stipulates that we must do in a specific article - and Mrs Sudre, who is present, knows it well - Article 299 on the outermost regions."
"I therefore think that we must have the facility, and it is precisely this facility that the Commission has provided, to help these regions primarily in conjunction with these quantitative criteria."
"To sum up, Madam President, with your help and, on this basis, with the help of the rapporteurs, I now hope that an agreement will be reached very swiftly on this proposal for a regulation and on the amendment of the interinstitutional agreement."
"Because, behind the problems, the regulations, the thresholds, the rules, there are people - this we must not forget, I have met them and have been moved by their plight - people who have been wounded, injured, and are still waiting, and as we are quite aware, in addition to the injuries there are also people who have died."
"These people are currently waiting for Europe, together with the national and regional authorities, to help them reestablish, as a matter of urgency, the very basic conditions that they need to continue their daily lives."
"Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, the floods that hit Central Europe this August reached alarming proportions."
"They claimed numerous lives and inflicted massive physical damage."
"Entire regions and cities were devastated, and entire rural areas and cultural heritage monuments sustained severe damage."
"The extent of the destruction triggered a great wave of sympathy across Europe, and the desire to be able to provide assistance, also at EU level, to the countries concerned in mastering the countless problems they face quickly became apparent."
"Commissioner, the local populations gratefully recall that only days after the disaster occurred, you and Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, visited the regions affected to see the extent of the damage for yourselves."
"However, they were not only grateful, they were also hopeful."
"Your visit raised their hopes that in such a case, the EU would intervene."
"Until now, there have been no suitable instruments for this purpose at Community level, for as we know, an EU relief fund once existed, but was discontinued in 1998."
"As the rapporteur, I view the establishment of this new solidarity instrument as an important complement to the Structural Funds."
"It equips the EU with a flexible instrument with which to cut through red tape, which enables us to provide rapid on-the-spot assistance when disasters occur."
"The purpose of the Fund - which will be focused on immediate financial assistance - is to help the people, regions and countries return to normal living conditions as quickly as possible."
"Its scope will therefore be limited to the most urgent needs."
"The long-term reconstruction of infrastructures and businesses must be left to other instruments, and this EU aid will add to, not replace, the efforts of the countries concerned."
"The EUR 1 billion designated for this fund are 'floating': in other words, they are not earmarked for a specific budget line, but will be mobilised only when a disaster occurs."
"The Commissioner has rightly asked the question: What kind of disaster can this Fund be used for?"
"By defining a major disaster as any disaster resulting in damage estimated at over EUR 1 billion or more than 0.5% of GDP, this should ensure that claims on the fund are restricted to very exceptional damage."
"That is why the committee agreed, by a majority, on a definition that refers to 'major disasters'."
"We have deliberately refrained from making any reference to natural, environmental, or technological disasters."
"After all, what would we say to the people concerned if the European Union were hit by a disaster such as 11 September in New York, on a scale which claimed a similar numbers of casualties?"
"Faced with this scenario, we cannot say to people: Sorry, the EU is unable to help because this is not a natural disaster!"
"We should stick with the term 'major disasters' as well as the three-month deadline for the submission of applications for assistance from the Fund, as this is in line with the principles of urgency and immediate rapid assistance which underpin the Fund."
"As regards the availability of the financial resources granted, in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, which is the committee responsible, I call for a timeframe of two years so that the Fund can provide aid to restore immediately key infrastructures such as energy, water supply and treatment, communication, transport, health and education."
"The funds should also be used to provide auxiliary services, as well as to safeguard security infrastructures, take immediate measures to protect cultural heritage and clean up damaged natural areas, buildings and cities, and carry out emergency short-term repairs to dams."
"The stipulation that this grant must leave available 25% of the annual amount of EUR 1 billion allocated to the Fund up to 1 October each year in order to respond to disasters possibly occurring late on in the calendar year is supported by the committee responsible."
"Although the parliamentary procedure for the preparation and debate of this report is not without its problems due to the very tight timetable, I believe that the accelerated procedure adopted in this instance due to its particular urgency, with the aim of disbursing EUR 1 billion in November, if at all possible, is acceptable in this exceptional case."
"I think we should proceed as swiftly as possible."
"The people affected are waiting for assistance from the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, those of us who sit on the Committee on Budgets have had a truly great task laid on our shoulders, and I am both glad and grateful that there is one thing that has so far on this occasion become abundantly clear. It is a matter of common knowledge that this is, on the one hand, about getting very diverse things done very quickly because people really are waiting for assistance after having undergone something that we can scarcely imagine."
"On the other hand, we would have to toil our way through three complicated subject areas if we were actually to be able to do something that will be equal to the pressures of the future."
"For a start, we have to create a legal basis; one is in place today."
"We have today already been engaged in negotiations about it, and have had discussions about it in a very good atmosphere."
"I believe we will be able to come to an agreement."
"The Committee on Budgets attached primary importance to the need to embody all this in an Interinstitutional Agreement."
"We have to take care that we do not only give people the impression that we are now able to give aid with all speed, but must at the same time make it robust enough for it to last, to fit into the overall framework, to stand the test of time, and ensure that others affected at a later date may know that there are some things on which they can rely. What we must not do is again dangle a carrot before them and then later have to say that there is no basis capable of supporting what we want to do."
"We have therefore put the emphasis on three things."
"The legal basis must be decided on as soon as possible, and so we have cooperated very constructively with the Committee on the Regions, to which I am very grateful for having taken the majority of our amendments on board."
"Today, the Interinstitutional Agreement is as good as concluded, but just one small problem remains."
"The Commission must, as soon as possible, propose a supplementary and amending budget in which the money - the EUR 1 billion of which we are speaking - is actually made available as quickly as possible, and an appeal can be made to the Member States to produce the figures with all speed so that we can make progress on this."
"In our budgetary capacity, we have agreed that we want, in future, to hold out this EUR 1 billion at least as an offer."
"We will work together with everyone else as quickly as possible, but it must also be clear that we will do this as thoroughly as possible."
"My present optimism is founded on my past experience, in this House, of cooperation across all national boundaries, without regard to political allegiances, between the committees and also between the institutions - Parliament, the Council, and the Commission."
"I believe that the people of Europe can know that here there is real cooperation with human beings in mind."
"We, who, in our budgetary capacity are otherwise meant to focus our attention more or less exclusively on money, now know how valuable the human dimension is."
"There is now a need to provide assistance as quickly as possible, here and now, in Germany, in Austria, in the Czech Republic and, in future, also in regions which in the past sometimes felt that we, unfortunately, could not really meet their needs adequately."
"Madam President, my inaugural speech here in this House in 1994 was on the subject of the serious floods which had caused tremendous damage in Athens at that time, and I have spoken about natural disasters on numerous occasions since."
"On numerous occasions, both I and several of my fellow Members have called for the European Union to take action on the ground when major disaster strikes the Member States of the European Union."
"Last year, I submitted an amendment during the budgetary procedure for disaster-relief action on the ground by the Union, but it failed to achieve the required majority in the European Parliament."
"The fact that we are now well on the way to adopting a Solidarity Disaster Fund is of course, excellent news;"
"I just wish we had not waited until after the terrible catastrophe, the human tragedy in Central Europe this summer; but, nonetheless, the European Commission and Mr Barnier personally deserve our congratulations because, we are, at long last, on the way to adopting a Solidarity Fund for natural disasters and, of course, congratulations also go to our rapporteur, Mr Berend, on his report, his hard work and his proposed amendments, which are a step in the right direction and almost all of which were adopted by the Committee on Regional Policy."
"I should just like to say, in support of what Mr Barnier and Mr Berend have said, that it is right, first that there should be a broad definition of disasters and, secondly, that the European Commission and Parliament have laid down the right limit for including disasters in this regulation."
"I really hope the Council will not demonstrate the meanness it appears to be demonstrating on this particular issue and will be as generous as it should."
"The limit set by the Commission and endorsed by Parliament is the right one, it is not too low and it is not too high and I think that the message which all three institutions need to send out is a message of solidarity, a message that the European Union will act on human suffering."
"I trust the Council will take this message on board; as for Parliament, I think that, with Mr Berend's report, we are moving in the right direction."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, European solidarity is within our grasp!"
"Now and in the future, aid can be given at once when disasters strike."
"It is with gratitude that I, as a MEP from Saxony-Anhalt, see with what speed and unanimity the Commission and Parliament act."
"I have also found, among the flood victims in my region, that the European ideal can hardly be more clearly communicated than by aid."
"It is perhaps auspicious that we find ourselves debating this solidarity on this historic day when the enlargement of the Community has taken on a definite shape, for the Solidarity Fund is already open to the candidate countries and our solidarity is already being extended to them."
"My group's concern is to retain as far as possible the precision of Commissioner Barnier's fine proposal for a regulation."
"The Solidarity Fund is an instrument of aid, one that makes immediate aid possible and whose tasks must be clearly distinguished from those of the Structural Fund."
"I would like to highlight two amendments to the Commission draft."
"Firstly, I wish to follow Mr Berend in highlighting the more comprehensive definition of a disaster, which we wanted, and which will allow us to respond flexibly to future catastrophic events that would otherwise be hard to include under the Commission proposal, for example droughts or the fallout from acts of terrorism."
"Secondly, the extension to three months of the period in which application to the Fund must be made."
"This gives an appropriate response time to those candidate countries that are as yet less well equipped to deal with administration and does justice to a situation in which important parts of the administration have also been destroyed."
"Although this is not relevant to the Solidarity Fund, our discussion today should make reference to the call for a future European civilian emergency force."
"The flood disaster has shown that, whatever the efforts made, there were significant deficiencies in the leadership of operations, in materials, logistics and communication, at any rate as regards the cross-border dimension."
"This needs to be remedied."
"The Commission should start by encouraging or supporting joint exercises by fire brigades, by the agencies for technical aid, by the rescue services and so on in border areas."
"In the medium term, this could give rise to a logistically unitary aid network or even a civilian solidarity corps, which could indeed be deployable in the event of disasters outside the Community, for example after an earthquake such as that which recently struck Turkey."
"It is a vision such as that on which we should be working, and we should not wait until after the next disaster."
"My thanks - for I must not forget him - to the rapporteur for his excellent cooperation!"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks and, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Mr Berend, who has speedily drawn up this excellent report in exceptional circumstances."
"We must certainly all agree that we need a flexible tool that allows for quick action to repair damage caused by major disasters."
"Establishing the Solidarity Fund is such an important issue, however, that more time should have been set aside to discuss it."
"During the Committee debate and afterwards many factors came up which we have had insufficient time to consider properly."
"Our group is in favour of establishing the fund."
"The threshold for the use of the aid must be kept high."
"The fund must concentrate on immediate costs during the initial stage of major natural disasters."
"Actual reconstruction does not form part of the fund's remit."
"Risk factors must be addressed through insurance and preventive measures whenever possible."
"It is also important that the fund should not become a new variation on the Structural Funds, to be used up on a yearly basis."
"It must only be used when there has been an exceptional, major disaster, when help is really needed."
"One or two questions came up after the committee debate."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what the position will be on major disasters taking place in third countries and resulting in suffering for people in the Member States and the applicant countries."
"Secondly, what will the maximum amount of aid be as a percentage of the costs of damage?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my statement on the Commission proposal with a word of congratulations to Commissioner Barnier and his colleagues on the way that the presentation of the proposal for a regulation on the setting up of the Solidarity Fund has actually been very quick."
"By doing this, the Commission has in fact done its bit to meet the expectations of the citizens in the European Union's disaster areas for prompt aid."
"At the same time, I of course want to give my support to the discussion here in Parliament being a matter of urgency, and I expect the Council to go ahead with its project of direct dialogue to deal with Parliament's amendments to the Commission's draft."
"This would make it possible to actually make a start on allocating resources from the Fund with effect from 1 November, following adoption by the General Council on 21 October."
"I think this is virtually a world record for these three European institutions to get something from conception to realisation in such a short time."
"This is unmistakeably and tangibly symbolic of European solidarity."
"My group gives its support to the extension of the applicability of the Fund's resources to major disasters in accordance with the amendment brought in by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and is in consequence opposed to the Council's preference for concentrating on natural disasters."
"In the same way, as my fellow Members have already said, we are also, as a group, in favour of applying them to damage in excess of EUR 1 billion or 0.5% of GDP, 50% to be paid out at once, a three-month deadline for submission of applications, and the possibility of derogations for regions that are particularly severely affected."
"I would, though like to express my regret that, as the Fund is to be what one might term a fund with virtual money, it is not to be possible to transfer resources unused in one year to the following year and thus to accumulate them."
"To do so would have given us a more flexible instrument for giving as much help as possible to citizens, businesses and institutions affected even by major disasters."
"Mr President, we are, in principle, in favour of setting up the Solidarity Fund."
"However, the amended proposal as it is now before us will in time lead to an untenable financial situation within the framework of the present budgetary agreements."
"The term 'major disaster' has hardly been defined and if damage does not exceed the threshold value, there are generous exemption situations."
"The way this fund is being organised shows in my view a lack of any sense of responsibility."
"Although this may engender a warm feeling towards the EU among the citizens affected, ultimately, they end up paying for the emergency aid themselves."
"The fund has to be streamlined in order to stave off this sort of hopeless situation."
"This means restricting it to natural disasters and adapting the threshold values and exemption situations to its complementary nature."
"This is with a view to penalising negligence, promoting preventive measures, making optimum use of existing international damage schemes and guaranteeing the fund's effectiveness."
"I was the only one to hold this view in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I therefore foresee major problems when, after a few years, the financial balance sheet is drawn up."
"I doubt whether there will be any solidarity left between the states."
"For those who share my doubts, I warmly recommend our amendments."
"Otherwise, I pin my hopes on the Council's wisdom."
"Allow me to add that I am pleasantly surprised by the acoustics in this Chamber."
"This is probably due to the additional equipment that has been installed."
"I can assure you that it is working extremely well."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a community founded upon peace, and hence also on solidarity."
"Not only do we talk in those terms, but we live in solidarity and set definite dates."
"I would remind you that, at its first September sitting, Parliament almost unanimously passed a 19-point resolution on the flood disasters in Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, that our second sitting found us voting the Budget lines, and that today, in our third part-session, this mini-plenary is creating the legal basis for all this."
"We are standing alongside the victims, acting swiftly, unbureaucratically and consistently, and it is for this reason that we have also chosen to use the accelerated procedure for matters of urgent importance."
"We are keeping our promise, and I would also remind you that we have doubled the proposal by the Council and the Commission for EUR 500 million to be allocated to the Fund."
"We also call on the Council not to alter our definition of a major disaster - over EUR 1 billion in damage in any one country or over 0.5% of its GDP - as any change would nullify the consistency of our stance."
"We call upon the Council to take up the proposal from Parliament and the Commission and make it a resolution."
"We can and must tell the victims that, subject to the agreement of the Council on 21 October 2002, we will see to it that money can flow to the affected regions from 1 November onwards."
"Agnes Schierhuber and I are from an affected region in Lower Austria and represent many who know how much damage was done and how much hope has been kindled by the policy of acting speedily and naming specific dates."
"We rejoice and are also rather proud to be able to show by this example how we not only talk and make promises, but are also capable of fixing dates and acting promptly."
"Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the speed with which the Commission has put forward the proposals to set up a solidarity fund and the promptness with which our institution is able to respond to them."
"By this, we are showing that the European Union is reactive and responds to the concerns of its citizens."
"I also welcome the fact that the recommendations that the European Parliament is preparing to make emphasise an important point, namely an emergency fund, the aim of which is to provide essential relief items to those affected."
"The mechanisms for releasing the appropriations which are put in place as well as the timeframes specified must, as a necessity, take into account this specific point."
"European money must arrive quickly on the ground in order to assist victims at the time when they need it most."
"Because the aim of this Fund is to demonstrate in practical terms the solidarity of Europe's citizens towards disaster victims, many Members of Parliament and I myself would like the intervention thresholds to be more generous and to take into account regional characteristics."
"It is now the Council's responsibility to tackle this point."
"I believe, however, that if Parliament insists that flexible qualitative criteria be taken into account when releasing funds, it must be heard."
"It is possible that a disaster destroying poor regions of the Union, the outermost regions for example, or which completely devastates a territory, as has happened recently in the South of France, will not be able to benefit from European solidarity, because of nothing more than accounting reasons."
"I must say that, personally speaking, I believe it is essential that natural disasters are handled separately and as a priority, because, in this case, it is impossible to identify who is responsible and therefore to claim insurance."
"It is in these cases that European funds are most needed."
"As a final, very brief, point, I would like to reiterate that repairs must go hand in hand with the implementation of a genuine policy of prevention and that of a European civil protection force, in order to give rapid assistance to those European citizens who are in the most difficulty."
"We have taken note of that matter and will try to correct it for tomorrow morning."
"Mr President, Commissioner, many Members have already stressed the value of the solidarity - and this fund is called the 'Solidarity Fund' - which is implied in and is the corner stone, the heart of the measure on which we are about to vote. We are building a Europe of solidarity."
"I would, however, like to highlight another value which I believe is absolutely central to this initiative - and we have all supported it and contributed to its timely achievement - and that is the political benefit to be gained from it."
"I feel, Commissioner, that there have been very few situations or events in which many, very many of our fellow citizens have for the first time felt that Europe is genuinely close to them, that it is truly an elder brother ready to run to their aid when they are in difficulties."
"We must never forget that, in some cases, the only experience many of our fellow citizens have had of the European institutions is of a set of rules and regulations, bans and directives."
"I believe there is a political benefit to be gained from showing them the friendly side of Europe, as we are doing in this case, particularly at times such as this - and we are approaching a major referendum now, we all know the details - a political benefit which we must not allow to go to waste."
"How are we to avoid wasting it?"
"Commissioner, you put it very well and I fully agree with you."
"We cannot make this instrument, which was designed to respond to emergencies, rigid, unadaptable or inflexible, in other words an instrument which becomes ineffective or which is even in danger of not being used precisely because the rules to which we are linking it are too complex."
"We must maintain a certain flexibility in this matter and I can see that you are quite aware of this but - and this is the last point to which I would like to draw your attention, even though, I regret, you are not listening to me - I also feel that we must view this merely as an initial step."
"Ladies and gentlemen, nobody here wants to see events such as these repeated, but we have a responsibility to be realistic."
"Soon, there will be 25 Member States, and it is quite clear that the climate is changing."
"I am afraid that, statistically, it is realistic to expect more such tragedies to occur."
"Therefore, in the face of tragic events which, I am afraid, will be repeated, I do not feel that EUR 1 billion will suffice."
"We must endeavour to explore further possibilities for the future, Commissioner, for the 2004 budget, if possible."
"I will only make one suggestion at a time, and I would like to hear your opinion too. Why do we not set aside part of our leftover funds - for there is always so much money left at the end of each budget which we do not know how to spend - why do we not use a set amount for this fund?"
"I invite you to reflect on the matter."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this evening and tomorrow's vote will see us reaching another milestone in the European Union's manifestation of European solidarity."
"The floods have wrought their havoc, and we have taken immediate action."
"Let me take this opportunity to remind you of the resolution Parliament passed by a large majority - over 470 votes in favour - at the first September part-session in Strasbourg."
"We showed how aid can be provided quickly and secured on a durable basis, and that there can be an instant guarantee of European aid."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the Commissioner, who has so quickly taken on board this initiative by Parliament and submitted proposals, and say that it would be proper for Parliament to process these proposals without delay, even though our rules actually provide for a different procedure, and even though my parliamentarian convictions do not always lead me to favour our all too ready abandonment of our rights."
"In this case, though, it makes sense, and in this case it is right that we should act in this way."
"We have now created lines in the Supplementary Budget that we have just passed."
"We are now discussing the legal basis, about which we want to have agreement with the Council by the time we meet in Strasbourg at the end of this month."
"What this means is that the formal conditions for the disbursement of funds have been fulfilled."
"Two are required - the legal basis and the Budget line."
"What I ask is that the Commission should manage to come up with a supplementary budget quickly."
"That, Mr Barnier, is a job for your fellow Commissioner Mrs Schreyer rather than for you!"
"Money must also then be allocated to these lines, because - as I have told this House three times already - if a disaster strikes in the middle of August and emergency aid takes until just before Christmas to arrive, then that is not emergency aid at all!"
"We should not be deceiving ourselves."
"That being so, Mr Barnier, my request is to be passed on to Mrs Schreyer - who, I am glad to see, is coming in on cue - that a supplementary budget be set as quickly as possible, so that the lines can be funded and so that European solidarity can be a matter of deeds and not just words."
"This needs to be given expression, and it is time that we did so."
"I think that we in this Parliament have made our advance payment, and I hope that help can be given quickly, and in accordance with definite criteria, in any future disasters such as we have experienced in August, and that the events leading to the abolition, without legal grounds, of the former Disaster Fund do not recur."
"Not all the problems in Europe should be allowed to become European solidarity issues."
"This is where a clear dividing line must be drawn between solidarity and subsidiarity."
"If we manage that, we will be on the right track!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with very warm thanks to the rapporteur and all Members and staff of this House who have made it possible for this report on the establishment of the Solidarity Fund to be adopted so quickly. As certain Members of this House have already pointed out, the distribution of resources for the affected regions is dependent on it, and that not only in the Member States, but also in the Czech Republic and Slovakia."
"It is this prompt action that helps the EU to be taken seriously as a Union for its citizens, and to show that the same EU is capable of responding with efficiency and speed to the emergency situations in which they find themselves."
"Mr Karas has already referred to the fact that I too come from one of the regions affected, and I can assure you that people are really grateful for this solidarity."
"As well as the great damage sustained by roads, bridges, railway infrastructure and public and private buildings, over 20 000 hectares of farmland were devastated."
"Let me repeat that the damage in Austria amounts to something in the order of EUR 6 to 7 billion."
"The new Solidarity Fund is intended to be - indeed, it must be - a powerful instrument in an emergency and, for that reason, one whose use is targeted."
"I would like to give my wholehearted support to the rapporteur's proposals, and thus to those of the Committee on the Regions, as regards fixing the threshold at EUR 1 billion or 0.5% of GDP."
"The threshold of EUR 3 billion demanded by the Council strikes me as too high."
"It is also right to require that the financial resources be drawn on within two years."
"The two-month deadline cannot but be supported, as, if aid is to be given quickly, applications for it must be made with equal speed."
"Demands continue to be made on the Member States, which cannot evade their responsibilities for preventive measures or long-term reconstruction work, for which we will yet need much in the way of resources."
"My especially warm thanks are due to the Commission for coming up with proposals so fast, and especially for the Commissioners having been on the spot with the President of the Commission, and for these funds of EUR 1 billion being available."
"I really do hope that we will vote in favour of this report tomorrow and thus enable the funds to get to the victims as soon as possible."
"Parliament and the Commission will then have done their duty, and it is my very real hope that the Council will pass the necessary resolutions in October, so that the money will at last reach the victims."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my satisfaction regarding the rapid creation of this emergency aid fund that can be called upon in cases of major disasters, since victims have the right to expect the European Union to provide them with solidarity and assistance."
"I also regret, however, that this statement is only being made after several years of repeated requests to the European executive to set up an instrument of this sort, the lack of which was, for example, particularly marked following the storms which hit France in December 1999. Mr Savary mentioned this earlier."
"The powerlessness and inertia of the Community in such circumstances have been very badly perceived by the general public, even though efforts were undertaken to bring Europe closer to its citizens."
"Today, following the catastrophic weather in central Europe and in the south of France, the imminent prospect of the implementation of an emergency fund with an annual grant of EUR 1 billion may, at last, give slightly more credibility to the concepts of European solidarity and a common destiny."
"In this respect, I believe it is essential to congratulate, in particular, Commissioner Barnier, who succeeded in drafting a proposal for a regulation of very high quality in a record time."
"The Fund will provide emergency aid to any area affected by a major disaster, whatever its status with regard to the Structural Funds."
"An additional qualitative criterion stipulates that, in very exception circumstances, namely when the disaster affects a substantial part of the population of the region or the State concerned, the assistance from this Fund can therefore be used."
"I knew that we could count on you, Commissioner, for this provision to include the particular case of the outermost regions, whose geographical and climatic situation often causes dramatically poor weather that has devastating consequences on their relative prosperity."
"Article 299(2) of the Treaty must be able to be applied, including in the scenario in question that I obviously do not wish to see happen again in a hurry."
"You are to be congratulated on what I understand is your maiden speech in Parliament."
"Mr President, I wish first of all to thank each of the speakers for their contributions and their questions, and for the specific concerns that have been expressed."
"I particularly appreciated your almost unanimous praise for the Commission, for its ability to react and to take the initiative."
"I do not accept these compliments for myself alone."
"Mrs Schreyer, who stands beside me, has worked extremely hard to create a flexibility instrument that will enable us to finance this fund and, of course, all of our staff will also have appreciated your words."
"As Mrs Sudre said, for three years now, I have thought that the European Union's response to major disasters has not been equal to the task."
"I am reminded of conversations I had with Mr Hatzidakis a few days after I arrived at the Commission, the day after the earthquake in the Athens area."
"As a French citizen, I was moved, as I was when Germany was buffeted by storms; and there were also those disasters in the Azores ..."
"Frankly, for a long time I have thought, with regard to this issue of risk and risk control, that the European Union's response to major disasters has not been equal to the task."
"We have reacted in this way this time because the disaster that has befallen Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia is on a scale that has never been seen before."
"Under the auspices of President Prodi, we have all learned a lesson from this."
"I would like once again to thank your rapporteurs, especially Mr Berend, for their cooperation and their proposals."
"I heard Mr Lisi say: will EUR one billion be enough?"
"I certainly hope so."
"I even hope that this billion will not be used up every year."
"This is already infinitely more than the small budget line that existed previously and which could only be spread very thinly."
"Mr Lisi, ladies and gentlemen, we shall put our best foot forward."
"As the years go by - and I hope we will not be seeing too many disasters - we will establish points of reference and in a few years we shall evaluate the management of this fund."
"I have already said that if, by the end of the year, this fund were completely used up - and I must make it clear that I mean at the very end of the year - we could use credits from the following year."
"Let us use this EUR one billion first, however, if we need to."
"We will then assess what needs to be done."
"I would also like to say to Mr Ferber that in order to use this money effectively and rapidly, to benefit the communities that are expecting it - local representatives and businesses in Germany, Austria and in the two candidate countries that have been affected - we must be able to release these funds."
"I therefore insist on the fact that we must receive a request for intervention from the Member States and an assessment of the damage, even if the dossiers are not extensive technical ones."
"I said the same thing today to the Minister-Presidents of the German and Austrian Länder. We have informed the ambassadors of the countries concerned that we need assessments of the scale of the damage."
"To this end, we have been holding meetings with officials from the countries concerned."
"Mr Ripoll i Martínez mentioned the very specific case of droughts."
"I have to say, Mr Ripoll i Martínez, that droughts are not intended to be the main target of this solidarity."
"I would also add that if periods of drought do occur, as appears likely, we do have other means in the European Union budget, under the CAP for instance, of helping and of demonstrating solidarity, in particular where farmers are concerned."
"Lastly, I wish to reply to Mr Pohjamo, who asked me which countries apart from Member States of the Union could benefit from this fund."
"The proposal for a regulation lays down very clearly that this fund is designed for the countries of the European Union or those countries with which negotiations for accession have been opened."
"I should like, if you do not mind, since I have taken an interest in this matter for a long time, to say that in addition to this fund which I hope will be operational, thanks to you and to the Council, in a few weeks at the latest, there are lessons to be learned."
"Prevention is always cheaper than repair and consequently, I have had two ideas which we can discuss a little further."
"Firstly, although the Commission is not asking to be given competence in this field, I think it would be useful to have a benchmark study of the various insurance schemes in the Member States and candidate countries."
"I was struck quite forcefully the other day, during my visit to Saxony-Anhalt, when I met a businessman whose company had been totally destroyed and who told me that he had no insurance cover at all."
"I therefore believe that we must take a look, in each of our countries, at best practice and the best schemes and perhaps exchange these best practices in the framework of intergovernmental cooperation."
"My second idea concerns prevention, an issue mentioned by Mrs Guy-Quint and Mrs Schierhuber."
"In the proposals we are considering for the future regional and cohesion policy for the future agenda for after 2006 (proposals that I shall be making on behalf of the Commission at the end of 2003), I am determined to make prevention against natural risks and disasters a mandatory priority for the European Structural Funds in all of the Union's regions and in all of our programmes."
"Lastly, I wish to conclude, because I am going as far as possible into the lessons to be learned, by replying to Mr Stockmann and Mr Savary, that I also think we should go beyond mere coordination."
"We have already made progress since earlier disasters, particularly under the auspices and the authority of my colleague Margot Wallström."
"I think that we should move towards this fine and effective idea of a European civil protection force, that we should create a network of specialised units in our various countries, which can be linked up and mobilised in the event of disasters within Union territory or beyond, and that it should not be Belgians, French, Germans or Austrians who set out - each with much goodwill but separately - but Europeans who set out to help other Europeans - their neighbours."
"Perhaps we should discuss this issue further."
"Once again, we are not calling for Community competence."
"I also know that competence for civil protection is often not national. It is sometimes regional."
"But where there is a will there is a way and I think that it would be a fine and effective idea to go beyond mere coordination and one day to set up a European civil protection force."
"I thank you, Mr President and I thank the rapporteurs. Thank you in advance for your vote on this issue tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the energy performance of buildings (8094/2/2002 - C5-0268/2002 - 2001/0098(COD)) (A5-0297/2002) (Rapporteur: Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank our rapporteur for his quite remarkable work, particularly when we are talking about an issue of this scale, which involves taking real action, since, for once, we will be working on consumer information, on training and on new production priorities."
"I think it is crucial to provide information about the state of the EU's energy demand when it comes to energy consumption in the housing and tertiary sectors. This applies all the more at a time when the threat of global warming hangs over our future."
"Of course, we must also add to this the problem of our dependence on outside sources of energy supply."
"This is a directive which will, as a result of the four following instruments: the methodology for calculating the integrated energy performance of buildings, the application of minimum energy performance requirements to new buildings and to buildings undergoing renovations and the establishment of a system of energy performance certification, I believe, increase consumer information and encourage owners to invest in improving energy performance, which is in both their interest and that of their tenants."
"The particular notice system that we wish to put in place will enable us not only to keep citizens informed about this energy performance, but also to give public authorities an exemplary role in the field."
"It is therefore a text that constitutes a considerable qualitative leap in relation to the SAVE programme, because it has a restrictive nature that will give us total credibility with regard to the Kyoto challenges."
"I thank both the Commission and the Council which have, fortunately, abandoned the approach of voluntary measures in favour of that of a genuine piece of European legislation, which will alone guarantee results as well as uniform implementation."
"No one could think that this directive imposes constraints and an excessive burden on the construction sector."
"We maintain on the contrary that this is an opportunity for industry, for research and the consumer and represents a genuine boost for research into insulating material and heating and air-conditioning systems."
"Eventually, European industry will have considerable expertise in the field of the energy performance of buildings, which will enhance its modernisation and its competitiveness."
"We shall, at the same time, be extremely careful to undertake an evaluation and to ensure a usage that is geared more towards housing for the most disadvantaged members of society."
"Might we perhaps be able to hope that the first experimental models will be the buildings of the European Union itself?"
"I thank you also for the clarity and the transparency of the work undertaken with the Commission, and above all for the close attention the Council has paid."
"This is why, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote in favour of this text."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his sterling work, particularly in reaching a useful and speedy conclusion at second reading."
"We have aimed at the target of improved energy efficiency in buildings for some years, in the climate change programme amongst others."
"Some measures, such as the thermal insulation of new buildings, are indeed already provided for under the same programme."
"However, these were not binding on the Member States."
"In general, Community programmes have failed to result in the actual application of standards of energy efficiency in many Member States, so this directive, although modest, is indeed a step forward, a building block, if you like."
"The rapporteur was correct to point out that in view of the Kyoto timetable, we must be careful not to invalidate the directive by a long transition period, particularly for certification in specific areas."
"I congratulate him again on reaching a useful conclusion."
"Finally, I would like to add my voice to those who plea that we do something realistic about energy savings in Parliament buildings and in EU buildings in general."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0283/2002) drawn up by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on a communication from the Commission concerning the fraud-proofing of legislation and contract management (SEC(2001)2029 - C5-0158/2002 - 2002/2066(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a fact - perhaps an agreeable fact at this hour of the day - that I am able today to present to you a draft report that has been unanimously adopted by the Committee on Budgetary Control. I take great pleasure in the fact that we expressly welcome the Commission's ideas relating to the fraud-proofing of legislation and contract management."
"It is always cheaper to avoid or prevent fraud than it is to attempt, after the event and at great expense, to put things right."
"I would like to bring up a couple of other items that we would like to see reinforced."
"Firstly, fraud-proofing must not be allowed to unduly prolong the preparation of European legislation, nor must it be limited exclusively to new draft laws."
"On the contrary, existing legislation must also be checked for flaws."
"I believe it to be also a credibility issue that we should, in tandem with this draft law from the Commission, start to scrutinise policies that we know, Commissioner, to be an invitation to fraud - the examples that come to my mind include export refunds in the area of agriculture."
"Secondly, we have to hold fast to the primary purpose of the anti-fraud office, OLAF, which is, of course, to combat fraud and corruption and not to do the things proposed here."
"We are prepared, however, within the framework of the 2003 work programme, to examine whether OLAF has sufficient human and financial resources at its disposal to effectively perform the duties transferred to it."
"Here too we have to discuss whether we can transfer an increasing number of tasks to this Office."
"We have had to note a cut in its budget for the coming year."
"Parliament is trying to get matters back in some sort of order, but this is not just about the Budget; it is quite simply about the fact that we know that one of the reasons for the failure of OLAF's predecessor, UCLAF, was that it did everything and therefore managed nothing."
"The main focus here, then, must be on the essentials."
"It is our view that standard contracts and agreements should be drawn up and collected centrally, and that this would make it easier to track and monitor parties to contracts and transactions under them."
"We take the view that a clause should be incorporated into the contracts and agreements to exclude from the award of future contracts those partners guilty of any fraudulent act."
"Here too we urge the Commission to give priority to more consistent application of the options that are already available."
"It is a tragedy, for example, when EUROSTAT repeatedly points out that firms cannot be got rid of even when it is proven that they gave false information as early as the stage of putting out to tender."
"Where does that get us?"
"That is surely a credibility issue!"
"The combating of fraud is essentially a credibility issue, and credibility is something the Commission has yet to provide in various areas."
"To repeat, we are very satisfied with what the Commission has submitted here."
"What really will make a difference is how it is implemented."
"What will matter, in the final analysis, is how seriously and with what transparency we want to remove the flaws from our own legislation."
"I would like to tell the Commissioner without any equivocation that, on this issue, we in Parliament are standing alongside the Commission, but we need openness, and, when it comes down to it, we also need transparency, if we are to be able to work together on these problems."
"Mr President, Mr Bösch, honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking Mr Bösch for the support expressed in his report and which he has just reiterated."
"The Commission's initiative both forms an important part of the work of reform as a whole and has a part to play in the Commission's overall strategy for the protection of financial interests."
"As you have emphasised, its aim is to improve the fraudproofing of Community policies and legislative proposals."
"The prevention of fraud is nothing new."
"It was and is a matter of major concern, and it must be comprehensive, meaning that it must, so to speak, be present right from the very outset, and hence - as you also emphasised - in the initiative and the proposal; it cannot be introduced later, at the implementation stage."
"Fraud prevention is not the province of a few specialists alone, a fact that has led us to declare that inter-departmental cooperation must start at an earlier stage, rather than leaving all the work to OLAF."
"The expertise of the Directorates-General must be combined with the specialist knowledge that OLAF has gained from its practical experience."
"This sort of cross-fertilisation can be useful as a means of developing fraudproofing in such a way that legislative drafts are examined with a view to making them fraudproof."
"This is about establishing a method of working intended to combine this expertise with knowledge about prevention, and doing that without needlessly prolonging the legislative process."
"I fully agree with the emphasis you have put on it."
"Another important aspect has to do with making lawmaking simpler."
"It of course has a preventive function for the legislative process not to be so complicated that it becomes incapable of being monitored; simplification, on the other hand, also creates good openings for legal control."
"The fraudproofing mechanism is meant to help shape legislation in a way that makes it clear and fraudproof."
"I would like to enlarge on what you mentioned in that context; on the one hand new draft laws, and on the other, the checking of laws already in force."
"That, of course, again raises the question of the human resources available."
"We are now starting on current lawmaking processes, which is of course the first step."
"Once a procedure has become established, we will see to what extent we can apply this also to the amendment of laws, with which we are also constantly occupied."
"OLAF is now getting on with drawing up criteria, appointing contact persons, and installing this mechanism."
"Let me, however, point out that making legislation fraudproof is not just a matter for the Commission, but legislators are also of course obliged, for their part, to treat this principle as a decisive criterion when framing laws."
"Let me conclude with the additional observation that even the best policy of prevention can only be a success if it goes hand in hand with a credible framework of deterrence, as indeed, Mr Bösch, you emphasise in your report."
"Fraudproofing measures must not be allowed to limit in any way OLAF's firm action in bringing fraud and irregularities to light; they are merely supplementary to it."
"I might add that the Commission is endeavouring to bring about improvements in the area of criminal law."
"We have just had the hearing on the European Public Prosecutor, and will take this opportunity to thank Parliament for the great support it has given."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not only does combating fraud seem to be becoming an ongoing task in the EU, but the Commission is also showing a great deal of imagination when it comes to the ways and means, and it is again showing its capacity for fantasy with this communication on the fraudproofing of legislation and contract management - a high-sounding title in very truth."
"It remains to be seen whether the draft, when it comes to fruition, will also contain what has been promised."
"I think it right to be sceptical about that."
"Since taking office, this Commission has distinguished itself by placatory promises, the words of which have not been followed up by actions."
"The Commission's announcement of its slogan 'Zero Tolerance for Fraud and Irregularities' has not prevented the officially-acknowledged fraud figures for 2000 from being higher than ever, and even those for 2001 from being, at EUR 1.25 billion, well above the average for previous years."
"Legislation and contracts are now to be drafted in such a way as to be fraudproof."
"It is as if they were meant to be stamped with the words 'checked and found fraudproof'!"
"Is that the big picture?"
"Is it not self-evident that legal documents - insofar as such documents are at all able to do so - promote lawful rather than unlawful conduct when the EU's billions are handed out?"
"Does the Commission not employ hosts of well-trained and highly-paid officials, and this objective not far from the least of those they are there to achieve?"
"Actually, I do think, if we are really honest, that this communication is superfluous, promoting as it does something that goes without saying."
"I can only sum this up by saying that the Commission's clocks are obviously set differently after all."
"It is evidently necessary to lay down by means of an official communication that we must obey rather than disobey the law."
"I find that very worrying on the part of an institution that is the custodian of the European treaties."
"In view of that, should the Commission not at last deal with the cases of fraud that have come to light and draw the necessary conclusions?"
"Is that not the method that promises success?"
"To give one example, why does the Commission, with the resources at its disposal, not take a certain former lady Commissioner before the European Court of Justice?"
"Providing a deterrent example for the future, that would be better targeted."
"But no, the Commission prefers to change the Financial Regulation in order to reduce transparency."
"It is still trying to limit Parliament's supervisory role, and it has done away with the independent financial controller."
"All these points are referred to in Mr Bösch's Report, which I also fully endorse in other respects."
"If fraud is to be successfully combated, then decisive intervention is indispensable."
"Anything else can be nothing more than an accompanying measure."
"Now I do not want to use this opportunity to enlarge on criticism of the Commission's book-keeping system, although there seems to be a certain amount wrong with it, but it is rather sad how the Commission continues to deal with criticism."
"It seems to have learned nothing from it."
"Mr Bösch mentioned it, and I want to repeat it."
"A Danish official is deprived of her brief and is marginalised for drawing attention to instances of maladministration, by which I mean what went on at Eurostat, to which our report makes reference."
"Despite this criticism - and despite what I am tempted to bluntly call adequate grounds for suspicion - the Commission continues to cooperate with a firm that operates in a highly questionable way, which has won contracts by deception and has failed to do any good work."
"This is something to which the Commission must respond."
"If it does not, it cannot be spared the criticism that communications such as this one are nothing more than diversionary manoeuvres!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is report (A5-0307/2002) by Mr Holmes, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks (COM(2002) 108 - C5-0135/2002 - 2002/0053(CNS))."
"I am privileged to present this report on behalf of my colleague from the Fisheries Committee, Michael Holmes."
"Members may be aware that Mr Holmes recently underwent major surgery and I am sure that the House will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery."
"Firstly, I congratulate Mr Holmes on his excellent work in compiling this report."
"We are dealing with this issue against a background of collapsing fish stocks throughout the European Union."
"Indeed, at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, the issue of over-fishing in international waters was recognised by countries around the world."
"They committed themselves to limiting fishing to sustainable levels and to taking steps to restore fish stocks by 2015, a position fully supported by Commissioner Fischler."
"Indeed, he expressed the view that the EU should achieve these targets long before that date and he pledged decisive action against illegal and unregulated fisheries practices."
"That is why I find it bizarre and even astonishing that the Commission agreed to a Council compromise last June which effectively paves the way for a total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas to be applied to deepwater stocks."
"Although this was judged by Mr Arias Cañete, the Spanish President-in-Office of the Council at that time, to be one of the highlights of the Spanish Presidency, it requires closer examination."
"The science in relation to deep-sea stocks is not yet fully developed."
"However, we know that these fish live at great depths - over 1 200 metres - and we know that they are slow-maturing, not reaching breeding age until they are at least 25 years old."
"We also know that they have a very low reproductive capacity, and that there are around 87 different species of fish swimming together at these great depths, of which only around eight are edible or marketable."
"As a result, we know that fishermen in these waters regularly dump around 90% of all the fish they catch, dead, back into the sea."
"Out of every 100 tonnes of fish caught, 90 tonnes are being thrown back dead into the water."
"Applying TACs and quotas to these deepwater stocks for the first time, as Mr Holmes points out forcefully in his report, will invite disaster."
"TACs and quotas are the root cause of the two million tonnes of good, fresh fish which are currently dumped dead into the sea every year in the EU."
"TACs and quotas only control what is landed, they do not control what is caught."
"If this House votes tomorrow for the application of TACs and quotas to these deepwater stocks, then I can predict with some confidence that this valuable fishery will be destroyed perhaps within as little as five years."
"As the Holmes report points out, the only way to regulate this fishery in a sustainable way is by effort limitation, by limiting the number of days during which a vessel may put to sea."
"If a fishing boat is not at sea, then it is not fishing and if it is not fishing, then the fish are not being caught."
"This is the only logical and realistic approach to achieving a sustainable deepwater fishery."
"That is why this is also the approach favoured by the scientists and by the fishing communities on whose future the survival of these stocks depends."
"Furthermore, it is essential that we apply strict controls to the type of gear being used in these deepwater fisheries."
"Gill nets are strung out at huge depths on the sea bed, sometimes stretching for up to 100 kilometres, and are then left anchored for days at a time while the parent fishing vessel returns to port."
"They can cause massive damage to these highly vulnerable species."
"Sometimes, these nets can also break loose and continue ghost-fishing for decades."
"These nets should be banned."
"Similarly, rock hoppers which bounce across obstacles on the seabed to avoid nets becoming snagged can cause enormous damage to delicate corals and sea mounts which are an essential part of the marine ecosystem."
"We cannot allow such unsustainable practices to continue unchecked."
"Needless to say, these ideas are not favoured by those Member States whose attitude to fishing is based on a short-term, dash-for-profit philosophy."
"They have no concern for the marine environment, for sustainability, nor for the massive socio-economic impact which will result if we allow these fisheries to collapse."
"I therefore urge this House to accept the amended proposals recommended by Mr Holmes in his report and I commend the report to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Mr Stevenson has already said, we are dealing today with our proposal on access requirements applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks and the proposal for the imposition of TACs and quotas for deepwater species."
"I would like to start by warmly congratulating Mr Holmes on his report."
"Expert opinion is as one in confirming that deep-sea stocks are at present heavily overfished, and the pressure on fisheries continues to increase."
"Stocks of deep-sea fish are, however, very sensitive in biological terms, as they have a very low breeding rate and grow very slowly - substantially more slowly than other types of fish."
"It therefore takes many years before deep-sea stocks that have been too heavily fished are able to recover."
"The opinions that we have received also state that TACs and quotas can be only a first step towards protecting deep-sea species."
"Experts also urge that the fishing effort should be restricted and new methods developed, principally for the collection of data relating to these stocks."
"That is why we have also submitted a proposal for licences, for effort limitation and the collection of data, and this proposal, taken as a whole, rests on four central pillars."
"Firstly, we need better flow of information from the fishermen to the scientists."
"Secondly, we have to introduce better supervision in order to get more reliable data."
"Thirdly, we have to be more vigilant in monitoring the landing of deepwater species and provide for fishing vessels to be monitored with the aid of satellites."
"Fourthly, we have to introduce a freeze on fishing licences for deep-sea species to keep them at the present level and prevent any further increase of the pressure on fishery."
"As a whole, we have to gain better knowledge of deep sea fishing and improve the stocks."
"Only then will we be able to enact fair and appropriate regulations."
"So I hope that Parliament will endorse these measures."
"I would like to wait until after the debate to say something about the amendments and let you know what position the Commission takes on them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is entirely fitting that at this time of the night we should be talking about species of fish that live in deep waters and which therefore also function to some extent in the night, in the darkness, as a result of the aquatic atmosphere in which they are immersed."
"Leaving irony aside, however, I shall say that these species of fish living away from the continental shelves are precious and are part of the rich diversity of marine life."
"We all agree, furthermore, that it is crucial to protect these species, these population units, from the heightened exploitation to which they have been subject in the last few years."
"In fact, the scarcity of fish on the continental shelf and in the major fishing grounds has caused many vessels and many fishermen to turn to these species that have survived or that have been largely ignored until now, and which are, consequently, on the way to suffering total despoliation."
"It is, therefore, absolutely crucial to protect these fish species and we also all agree that scientific research is essential since there is still a great deal we do not know about these species because they are, shall we say, rather mysterious, like everything from the deep, like everything from afar."
"Much more research must be carried out on observing these population units, their ecosystems, their living and reproductive habits and their fertility rates, because there are major fears that since these species' growth rates are slow, they are much more vulnerable to the exploitation to which they are subject."
"Although there is agreement on the diagnosis and on the shortcomings of the research carried out to date, there seems to be some disagreement about the methodology with which to protect these species, as far as I could understand from Commissioner Fischler's intervention."
"Nevertheless, I do not see how we can avoid the need for total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas - the old methodology, which produced some results, although it has its limitations; nor do I see how we can avoid limiting fishing efforts."
"I know that this is a very sensitive matter, because nowadays, the activity of fishermen, fishing communities and investments clearly always take priority. In this case, however, the precautionary principle must be applied."
"Where we cannot be certain, we must be cautious and prudent."
"Consequently, we must do everything that can be done, even though we cannot be certain about the result and the efficiency of this action, to protect these fish species, these dozens and dozens of species, the habits of some of which may even be unknown or almost unknown."
"I therefore congratulate the Commission and Mr Holmes on their work, because this work is crucial to the protection of nature."
"Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Holmes for his work and join in wishing him a speedy recovery."
"The ELDR firmly believes that there is an urgent need to regulate this fishery."
"Available scientific evidence on deep-water species suggests that they are outside safe biological limits and that measures should be introduced to allow rebuilding of the stocks. Action is particularly essential in light of the fact that these fish live a long time, grow slowly and have low reproductive capacity."
"The majority of the amendments made by the committee seek to exempt ling and tusk from the scope of the regulation, although they would still be covered by quotas."
"Whilst the group accepts that these two species are caught on the continental shelf, it is imperative that they are properly regulated."
"If these amendments are adopted by Parliament, the ELDR will vote against the proposal as a whole."
"As for Amendment No 5, the ELDR believes that kilowatt fishing days are a more accurate tool to measure effort in view of the so-called technological creep and so cannot support this amendment."
"We are, however, favourable to Amendment No 6 which requests a review of the progress being made in achieving the aims of the regulation."
"The ELDR has tabled three amendments of its own."
"Amendment No 8 calls for an economic and operational impact assessment in relation to the expected loss of revenue and effort displacement resulting from the implementation of the regulation."
"Amendment No 9 seeks to outlaw the use of fixed gill nets in this fishery as they risk inflicting substantial unintended mortality on heavily depleted stocks."
"Finally, Amendment No 10 proposes the use of area closures to protect species which accumulate particularly densely in certain areas at certain times of the year."
"The ELDR is also minded to support Amendments Nos 12 and 16 by Mr Hudghton and others on greater involvement by the fishing industry and on safety respectively."
"It has, however, doubts as to whether fishing effort control should be the sole management tool and therefore also has doubts about Amendments Nos 11 and 14."
"The ELDR is concerned that Amendment No 13 may delay the implementation of the management measures and also believes that Amendment No 15 could potentially have a negative impact on the environment."
"On a personal level, however, I feel that regulation of catch opportunities in a mixed fishery by means of both TACs and quotas and an effort regime, based on licences, will lead to the discarding of species for which a quota is not held or where the quota has been exceeded."
"For this reason, I shall support Amendments Nos 11 and 14."
"I will also support Amendment No 15 as it represents a fairer basis for the distribution of quotas."
"Finally, I would like to express, on behalf of the ELDR, a profound dissatisfaction that the Council has effectively taken a decision on this dossier without awaiting the opinion of Parliament."
"We would hope that the Fisheries Council will see fit to take its views on board when it reaches its formal decision."
"Mr President, I too would like to welcome Mr Holmes' report and hope he makes a speedy recovery."
"When the Commission's proposals first appeared, we, in the Green Party, welcomed them."
"It was high time that these newly-developed fisheries for deepwater species were brought under some sort of control."
"We are all aware of why these species are particularly vulnerable to over-exploitation, as Mr Stevenson pointed out in his introduction."
"As the stocks in EU waters which were the traditional target of EU vessels were becoming depleted, the result was the development of these new fisheries."
"At the same time, we feel that the conclusions of the negotiations over the detail of the management regime put in place are much too weak."
"They are also too dependent upon TACs and quotas which have proved such a disaster elsewhere, as Mr Stevenson pointed out."
"We hope that now that a management regime is put in place, the Commission will act quickly to strengthen it - for instance by other means, such as much stronger technical measures and more restrictive effort controls."
"This is what will be effective in the long term."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the move that led to the proposal for a regulation that we are debating this evening is exemplary and deserves thorough consideration when it comes to updating the common fisheries policy."
"Around fifteen years ago, the French fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer began fishing for and selling certain species of fish living beyond the continental shelf in the deep trench, which is more than 800 metres deep."
"It was at the request of these professional fishermen that a scientific research institute, Ifremer, started to take a close interest in the biology of these species and particularly in their biological cycle."
"A fruitful collaboration between professionals and scientists enabled them to determine quite early on that these species have slow life cycles and that there was an urgent need for catches to be limited so as not to endanger their biological balance."
"Also at the request of the professionals, supported in their action by the scientists, the government of the main Member State concerned, France, asked the Commission to take action to regulate these new fishing grounds by establishing TACs and quotas."
"The Commission was reluctant for a long time and dragged its heels."
"Without the political agreement reached at the Fisheries Council of last June, it is unlikely that we would now have these two proposals for regulations on fishing deep-water stocks."
"Finally, however, we do have them and I welcome both them and the report by Michael Holmes, who has addressed this issue with great competence and whom I too wish a speedy recovery."
"The way in which these regulations have come to exist is exemplary for more than one reason."
"It illustrates first of all the fact that fishermen are of course the main people concerned and the main actors when it comes to establishing rules for sustainable fishing."
"It also shows that the instruments best suited to providing the effective protection of fish species are those which are flexible and reversible, such as TACs and quotas, and not rigid structural measures with irreversible effects such as the destruction of vessels or the retraining of fishermen."
"It also shows that fishermen and scientists can work together closely and intelligently and come up with proposals for realistic and constructive management measures which allow fishing to take place whilst at the same time managing resources."
"Lastly, it demonstrates that an upwards action rising from the field level to the competent authority is more effective than the downwards and even condescending action usually favoured, unfortunately, by the Commission, not least when it launched the draft reform of the CFP."
"These lessons must therefore be carefully retained and implemented, if possible, within the entire process of reforms underway."
"Having said that, I think that we can only welcome the fact that we have achieved this regulation and I shall be supporting the report by Michael Holmes as well as most of his amendments, which have the support of the fishermen concerned, particularly those calling for the re-examination of the provision every three years in order to update the results obtained."
"Mr President, without verifiable, up-to-date independent scientific advice it is impossible to establish a TAC regime."
"How, then, could the Commission support such a regime?"
"How could the Council endorse such a scheme in June 2002 without proper consultation with the industry and the North East Atlantic Fisheries Council being left out of the picture?"
"The Commission has a lot to answer for in this, but the main appeal that I make at this stage is not for recrimination but for the proposal to be reconsidered."
"If conservation of stocks is to be achieved, we must regulate deep-sea fisheries under a regime based on effort limitation."
"We must take into account firstly that TACs will increase mortality through discards of the species most in the need of protection, and secondly, that safety could be put at risk as vessels with inadequate quota but a deficit in fishing days would be pressurised to fish under perilous conditions."
"I urge this House and also the Commission to support the amendments in the name of the ELDR Group and those in my name which are signed by various members of the four largest groups in this House."
"Finally, the social and economic implications of any final proposal must be fully assessed and measured for compensation provided where appropriate and without discrimination between fishermen in different Member States."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my warm thanks for this debate, but want to remind you that this proposal was submitted by the Commission as long ago as the beginning of March, and I also want to make it clear that the Commission did not give the Council any agreement to the political compromise that the latter had worked out; on the contrary, the Commission has noted that it will take up a final position on the acceptability or otherwise of this compromise only after Parliament has made its views known."
"I must say in all frankness that there is also no truth in the assertion that no scientific evaluation exists."
"A scientific opinion has been given by ICES, and also by our scientific advisory forum."
"There is indeed no lack of scientific foundation for what we are doing!"
"Let me turn now to the various amendments, which I would like to evaluate in the light of the debate."
"The first amendment is one that the Commission can accept."
"I agree that ling, tusk and red spot seabream should be taken out of the scope of the regulation, although these fish should remain on the list of species for which detailed information on catches is required."
"I can also accept Amendments Nos 2 and 4, but not Amendment No 3, as I am against removing the supplementary provisions on satellite surveillance from our proposal, our practical experience with the satellite system having shown that failures are often not real failures at all, but are simulated in order to circumvent the surveillance."
"Moreover, traditional monitoring with patrol vessels and aircraft is far from adequate to deal with deep sea fishing, especially in very distant areas; indeed, it is not even a workable proposition."
"We therefore need effective monitoring by satellite, and we must tighten up the definition of an equipment failure and the consequences resulting from one."
"I am happy to take on board the addition to Amendment No 5 to the effect that fishing days should be days out of port; that is a useful clarification, but the reference to catch areas is less clear than our proposal that the exact ICES statistical rectangle should be indicated."
"I am therefore unwilling to accept it."
"Considerations of confidentiality lead me to consider it inappropriate to publicise the identification of individual vessels for scientific studies."
"I can understand that the measurement of engine power in kilowatts is problematic and difficult to enforce."
"Instead, then, of deleting the reference to capacity, which is necessary to scientific analysis, we want to improve the reference by, for example, specifying the classes of vessels, which can be summarised by reference to gross registered tonnage."
"Amendment No 6 is, in my view, a good idea, and I am willing to provide for revision of the measures in 2005."
"I can also go along with Amendment No 7, but not with Amendment No 8."
"The Commission, in any case, has consultations as a matter of routine with the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries on the social and economic consequences of conservation measures, but I am quite happy to accept Article 9a and submit to the Council and to Parliament, by 30 June 2005, a report on the general arrangements for the management of deepwater species, which would also cover the scientific dimension of a reduction in fishing effort."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 9 as at present drafted, as no scientific evaluations have been submitted to us demanding a ban on fixed gillnets, but I will take up your suggestion in this regard and ask ICES for a scientific evaluation of whether and for which areas such a ban on fixed gillnets might be a sensible conservation measure."
"I can agree to Amendment No 10."
"I have to reject Amendment No 11; although it is the case that the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recommends a reduction in the fishing effort for deepwater species, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries regards additional TACs as a useful supplementary measure."
"I am happy to accept Amendment No 12, but the Commission has to reject Amendment No 13 on the grounds that it would go against the precautionary principle."
"We must act as soon as we get scientific advice for the first time."
"The same is true of Amendment No 14, which I cannot accept either."
"In order to implement in practice an effort limitation, we need deep-sea fishing licences."
"I regret that I also have to turn down Amendment No 15."
"We are all aware that the deep sea fishing fleet has rapidly increased in power and capacity."
"If we were to change the reference period, we would be permitting a de facto further increase in the size of the deep sea fleet, which however does not at all fit in with the effort limitations that are urgently necessary."
"In conclusion, I have no option but to reject the final amendment, No 16, as well, as this amendment would make possible derogations from the regulation that would be impossible to monitor, the things termed 'force majeure' or 'risk to the safety of vessels' being concepts lacking any definition in law."
"Of course safety has to be guaranteed - there can be no question whatever about that."
"The provisions we have now also allow a ship at risk to dock in a port other than that designated, provided that it does not land its catch there."
"I believe this approach to be already balanced and to take the safety of ships sufficiently into account, as well as the enforceable provisions on conservation."
"Greenhouse gas emission allowance trading"
"Mr President, I am pleased to be able to address the European Parliament on the emissions trading proposal."
"I am proud of this proposal because I see it as a cornerstone of the European Union's cost-effective implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"First, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moreira Da Silva, for his unstinting efforts in bringing this proposal to its first reading."
"I know there were approximately 500 amendments in Committee, but we now have a much more manageable 100 amendments"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to use my opening words to express my thanks for the excellent cooperation I have enjoyed with the draftsmen and the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups."
"It is due to this cooperation alone that we were able to reach a good compromise in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I believe that this directive will create the conditions for climate change and the Kyoto Protocol to stop being a purely theoretical concern in Europe and become an essential strand of the environmental and economic policy of all the Member States."
"Essentially, this directive will form the basis of the carbon economy; the winners will be those who are able to achieve the same levels of production with the fewest emissions."
"I therefore congratulate the Commission, in the person of Commissioner Margot Wallström, on the initiative of proposing this directive, particularly because it will significantly reduce the cost of complying with Kyoto in the European Union."
"As a matter of fact, I believe that proving that this system works, proving that this system will reduce the cost of complying with Kyoto in the European Union, will be the best way for us to convince our US friends to abide by the Kyoto Protocol."
"Nevertheless, despite considering the proposal for a directive to be positive on the whole, there are areas in which Parliament wishes both to go further and to improve the basic proposal and a broad compromise was reached on these matters."
"Consequently, rather than putting forward my own point of view, I am speaking on behalf of all of those who adopted this compromise."
"Firstly, I think it is important that this directive has quantified targets for compliance and we feel it is crucial that there should be a maximum ceiling on emission allowances per Member State, on a linear curve converging with the Kyoto Protocol."
"Secondly, we feel it is important that the Member States should be able to add to the sectors and activities included in the system."
"I am thinking about the voluntary 'opting in' of sectors such as transport or small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States that feel it would be appropriate."
"Thirdly, the use of credits must be completely prohibited in the directive's first implementation period."
"Fourthly, we consider it important that the directive should cover all six greenhouse gases, not only carbon dioxide, provided that these six gases are included on the basis of transparent criteria, identical to those used for carbon dioxide."
"Fifthly, we believe it is important that the chemicals and aluminium industries should also be included in this directive."
"Lastly, with regard to the areas in which we feel that the Commission's proposal ought to be extended and made more ambitious - and I am referring to the initial emissions allowance allocation system - I think that a hybrid system based on free allocation but with some auctioning (5% in the first period, 15% in the second period) is better than a 100% free allocation as advocated in the proposal for a directive, not only in the economic strand, but also in the environmental strand and as regards reducing distortion of competition."
"I have left what I believe to be the most important issue to the end: legal involvement."
"It is my view that this system can only work if it is legally binding, in other words, mandatory."
"I believe the Committee on the Environment achieved a good compromise on legal involvement, a binding system with the temporary exclusion - with limits on both the duration and the conditions - of some companies in the first period."
"I believe the adoption of Amendments Nos 75 and 81 to be quite unjustified and even dangerous, because this would basically mean turning a binding system into a voluntary one and consequently increasing distortions of competition, reducing the liquidity in the market, increasing the price per tonne of carbon dioxide and reducing the economic efficiency of the system."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva, the other draftsmen of opinions and the shadow rapporteurs for the pleasant working relationship that produced the proposal that is now before us."
"I should note in this respect that it became abundantly clear during the process that the proposal on emissions trading is controversial."
"Consequently, differences of opinion among the supporters and opponents of the scheme resulted in an overwhelming number of amendments."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I call for a uniform and transparent emissions trading scheme, a scheme which clearly describes the rights and duties for the government and industry."
"It should, however, also do justice to industry's entirely unique dynamic, a dynamic in which continuity and scope for competition are not unnecessarily hampered by new rules."
"It is therefore gratifying to see that in the final report that is now before us, a number of amendments tabled by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have been adopted in order to achieve this."
"I am particularly referring to extending the period of time in Article 11, adapting the penalty clause in Article 16 and the way in which Member States tax the emissions trading scheme in Article 16, Paragraph 4."
"Clarity about factors that distort the market promotes the effectiveness of a market for emission rights."
"It is therefore regrettable that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy failed to reach agreement on the way rights will be allocated from 2008."
"It still is of great importance to remain alert with regard to measures that Member States may take in order to intervene in a market for emissions trading by introducing its own schemes and taxes."
"Resistance to an emissions trading scheme will continue to exist among various parties and will lead to the rules being bypassed."
"A lack of clarity in the directive should therefore not mean that emissions trading is doomed to fail."
"The saying 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating' therefore very much applies to emissions trading."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"My colleague, Mr Blokland, just said that the proof of the pudding is in the eating."
"I would like to say that those who have not thought about emissions trading might consider how a lobster is eaten. Imagine that you have a large lobster on a plate in front of you."
"First it is quite easy to get very large and juicy mouthfuls from it, but things then become quite difficult when you get to the small claws and joints, and then you leave them on the plate because it is no longer really worth the bother of going on with the meal."
"The idea now of course is that emissions trading will help us find the juicy targets for reductions in emissions, ones where a reduction in emissions is cost-effective and where it really is worth the bother, and perhaps the more difficult targets can be left to last or be dealt with in other ways."
"Effective means are needed to realise the Kyoto Protocol commitments."
"I would like to say that the wisest course of action is to start now, because in all likelihood the obligations under the Kyoto Protocol will enter into force from 2008."
"We know that in business those that get in early often also reap the highest profits."
"The report by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy fulfils all the key requirements for a good emissions trading system."
"Firstly, Parliament will vote today on the proposal to significantly extend the emissions market with the inclusion of new sectors, including new gases."
"That way we can be sure there will be enough sellers and buyers in the market."
"As regards the flexibility that the Member States have been looking for, I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has found the best possible flexible approach, so that Member States, subject to certain conditions, may temporarily exclude some installations from the emissions trading scheme."
"This, I think, was an excellent solution, and one which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also proposed."
"Most important of all is the notion that in allocating these emission allowances we should adhere to the criteria whereby companies that have already attended to the matter of reducing their emissions are encouraged and rewarded."
"In fact the auction debate is connected with this very issue, because auctions would introduce that element that would encourage and reward the trendsetters."
"I hope Parliament will accept at least a small proportion of auctioned allowances."
"We on the committee and in Parliament as a whole have enjoyed some quite excellent levels of cooperation."
"I wish to thank both the rapporteur and the Commission in particular very much for this."
"Thank you, Mrs Hautala."
"Perhaps you would also let us know where you like eating lobster, as you use it as such an elegant example."
"Mr President, I am not going to speak about lobsters, but I share the interests of the two previous speakers."
"Mr President, you know everything by definition, so you already know the opinion of the Industry Committee."
"In case there are any colleagues here who do not know, it is my role to report it."
"There was a broad spread of opinions in the Industry Committee, as I shall briefly describe."
"I will summarise a number of key points which our discussions centred around."
"First of all, perhaps most importantly, should the scheme be compulsory or should there be opt-outs or exemptions?"
"There were a number of voices from certain national quarters asking for exemptions."
"Other committee members believed that if we allowed exemptions, everyone would ask for one and there would be no directive, so there was a dilemma there."
"There was also a concern that the benefits that the cutbacks already achieved in certain Member States will not necessarily be rewarded adequately."
"This should be taken care of."
"There was general agreement that from 2008 the directive should be compulsory."
"Regarding allocation of allowances, the Committee is against auctioning."
"It seems to be a waste of resources when the industry should be using it to cut back."
"The Committee is interested in including other sectors, even perhaps in transport and private housing, although this will be difficult to achieve."
"We are in favour of including the other five greenhouse gases, although measurement is an important question."
"On comitology and whether the Commission should be allowed to decide the future details, we are firmly, unanimously against."
"We want full co-decision for the next directive when it is proposed."
"We want the other parts of the world to pay attention because what we do is useless unless the Americans, Russians and Asians are involved as well."
"Finally, a personal point, the public should be allowed to buy quotas because we want to involve the citizens in European activities and in saving the world."
"Mr President, I too should like to start with a few words of thanks."
"First of all to the Commissioner and her staff who have presented a sound proposal and were always prepared to discuss it with MEPs."
"Secondly to Mr Moreira da Silva, who has tried to improve the proposal with an admirable doggedness."
"And finally the colleagues of my own group who have had to sit through long discussions on this topic."
"Tradable emission rights turned out to be a thorny subject."
"During all the difficult discussions, it was sometimes necessary to remind ourselves of what we are working towards, namely Kyoto."
"We must pursue the ambition of fighting climate change, and we must do this in an economically and socially responsible manner."
"Three aspects were paramount in our group."
"First of all, we wanted to maintain, and where possible reinforce, the proposal's environmental integrity."
"We therefore endorse Mr Moreira da Silva's proposal to introduce a cap, a maximum ceiling, so that we can be certain that emission levels are indeed dropping."
"We are, in principle, in favour of cooperating in this area with Eastern European countries and developing countries, provided that this is done in a way that precludes the use of sinks and nuclear energy."
"Secondly, the PSE Group wants the scheme we are drafting to be fair and to be experienced as such."
"This is why a credible sanctions policy should be put in place, this is why we want to absolutely avoid early innovators being disadvantaged and this is why the allocation method should also be the same wherever possible."
"Discrepancies that are too great between Member States lead to distortion in competition."
"It is still impossible to settle on one allocation method, be it grandfathering or auctioning, even within our group."
"Thirdly, the scheme must be effective."
"This means that the market must be as big as possible: the more players, the more effective the scheme."
"I have to say that the discussion on this score was sometimes a little alienating."
"I am of the opinion that it is not at all in the interest of companies to make use of an opt-out clause, for these companies must reduce their CO2 emissions, come what may."
"Businesses that fall within the scheme can - if they fail to reduce emissions - buy emission rights on the market."
"Businesses that do not fall within the scheme will need to switch off installations or even shut down divisions."
"In my view, this is not a particularly socially-minded solution."
"We as Socialists take employment seriously."
"This is why companies and trade unions do not stand to gain anything from an opt-out."
"It may therefore be a good idea to withdraw Amendment No 81."
"It is of great importance for us to be able to announce progress in the European climate policy in New Delhi."
"Parliament is taking an important step today; it is the Council's turn next week."
"It is equally of major importance for us to flesh out the concept of sustainable development in the wake of Johannesburg."
"With this decision on tradable emission rights, we do justice to the environment, but also to guiding principles in the social and economic field."
"We may not be agreed on the nuts and bolts, but this is the general line that we need to bear in mind."
"Today, we have the opportunity of opting in favour of sustainable development."
"Let us do so, therefore, with conviction."
"Mr President, a few weeks ago we returned from the Johannesburg Summit with the demands ringing in our ears that fine words should be turned into real action in the knowledge that Europe's pledges were being greeted with cynicism by journalists and the public."
"Yet if those same critics look to the issue of climate change they will find that such cynicism is unwarranted."
"From the beginning, the EU has led from the front."
"It confounded the cynics by securing agreement for implementation of the Kyoto Protocol and by pushing the US and its head-in-the-sand administration into the sidelines."
"We now see words being turned into action, with an emissions trading scheme which may well prove the basis for meeting up to 50% of the reductions we have pledged to achieve."
"I first read about emissions trading and about harnessing market forces to encourage industry to meet environmental objectives a decade or so ago in pressure group magazines."
"Now those ideas, then so easily dismissed as crazy and impractical, are being given positive form."
"I commend the Commission for its draft directive."
"In many ways, however, it is a timid document and thanks to the work of our rapporteur we have all-party agreement to press for it to be made more ambitious."
"Liberal Democrats in the Parliament will be joining in supporting a range of measures to broaden its scope, to extend it to include additional industrial sectors and require it to include other global warming gases in addition to CO2."
"Personally, I absolutely accept the need for a cap in allowances in each Member State although I acknowledge that some of my colleagues in my group are concerned that the requirements being placed upon their nations by the burden-sharing agreement are already onerous."
"We have a lot to learn."
"That is why I am pleased that Parliament will today vote to give a temporary opt-out to those emission-trading schemes already established."
"I am not convinced that the British scheme provides the basis for long-term development."
"It is a different scheme in concept and application from the Commission's proposal, and we should be able to learn and benefit from it in the long term."
"After the successful conclusion of the Kyoto conference in Bonn, the Commissioner told the press that we could now tell our grandchildren that we did something to tackle the problem of climate change."
"All of us, Commissioners, Ministers, and parliamentarians want to be able to endorse those words."
"It will not be easy."
"There are some understandable national concerns but also some narrow, commercial interests wishing to dilute these measures."
"We must keep our eyes on the long term and the enormity of the challenge."
"If we do not take action now, we turn our back on the very future of the planet."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his very extensive work, but above all for being really skilful in his cooperation with other groups and for trying to find wide-ranging solutions."
"We appreciate this very much."
"I think that the report before us contains a great many improvements on the Commission's proposal."
"After all, this is a very complicated subject."
"When it comes to the trade in emission rights, the main emphasis should be on taking measures that are as effective as possible."
"At the same time, there is a risk that this might be seen as a substitute for political action to reduce emissions, and this must not happen."
"Sometimes, too much confidence is placed in the trade in emission rights compared with the necessary measures that also have to be taken in other areas."
"The trade in emission rights at global level within the Kyoto Protocol is a system involving many risks."
"It is in danger of producing a situation where rights to emissions are purchased that do not subsequently exist."
"We must discuss how this can be avoided in future."
"As for the actual proposal, we want the system to be binding and for the exemptions that are made to be as limited as possible."
"We want as many sectors as possible to be covered, and we naturally support the proposal for an extension to more sectors."
"We think it is reasonable that all six greenhouse gases be included, and we think that auctioning off a part of the quotas should begin as soon as is practically possible."
"This is wholly in line with the principle that polluters should be expected to pay for pollution."
"We also support the idea of a national ceiling on trade, and we want effective sanctions."
"We will therefore vote on the various parts of the proposal in accordance with this."
"Mr President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva, for the extremely fruitful cooperation."
"We in this Parliament have embraced Kyoto."
"Only four MEPs voted against."
"Kyoto does, however, mean minus 8% and not plus 8%, which will be difficult enough as it is."
"Without European measures, our fifteen governments will not succeed individually."
"Some eight countries have introduced national eco-taxes, but the industrial bulk consumers fall outside of these national eco-taxes."
"And this is precisely where the European emissions trading scheme comes in, as nearly 50% of European CO2 emissions will fall within its scope."
"There has been a great deal of discussion in the United States about CO2 trading, but this has not been followed up by any positive decision-making."
"Hopefully, we in Europe will be taking the historical decision to take the lead in actually setting up a definite scheme."
"This is desperately needed, for we have been talking about European energy levies unproductively for the past decade."
"These have not materialised because individual governments, first the United Kingdom and now Spain, voted against."
"Another reason why these failed to materialise is because Commissioner Bolkestein refused to set up a leading group."
"In fact, this emissions trading scheme is the European energy levy scheme, but in a different guise."
"It is a better system, though; better than the energy CO2 levies, both from an environmental and economic point of view."
"My group, the Group of the Greens, has managed to get two important amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The first one is the helping hand to the United States."
"In Bonn in July last year, we talked to American businesses for two and a half hours."
"They are very interested in taking part in an international CO2 trading scheme."
"They believe that once President Bush is out of office, the United States will also follow suit."
"The second point we managed to get adopted is that the European Commission has been tasked with developing proposals in order to extend this scheme to include households and traffic."
"The traffic sector, in particular, is of major importance, for we have noticed that our national governments have failed to reduce CO2 emissions in the traffic sector, and this will be necessary."
"We are still at odds on one point, namely that of the allocation of emission rights."
"My group is in favour of an auction system."
"We have tabled a moderate compromise, only 15% auctioning and 85% free, but even this 15% auctioning will give a positive signal to industry that has made an early start on CO2 reduction."
"If the majority of my fellow MEPs endorse this amendment, then my group will be wholly satisfied."
"Mr President, over the past few months, we in Parliament, and outside, have witnessed a heated debate on the greenhouse effect."
"Do the use of fossil fuels and the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere form a serious threat or is it just hot air?"
"After all, recent research has shown that, although the role of CO2 emissions by people is restricted and that emissions trading can make a limited contribution to reducing CO2 emissions, the problem cannot actually be solved."
"Is emissions trading therefore pie in the sky?"
"I do not think so."
"The belief that a reduction in CO2 emissions is only of limited value in reducing the greenhouse effect is in my view wrong."
"If it indeed transpires that the part people play in causing the greenhouse effect can be minimised, emissions trading will have achieved one thing, namely that we are now more aware of, and more economical in the use of, our natural resources."
"With this, a second, unassailable goal has been achieved, namely that if we want to have long-term use of such natural resources as coal, oil and gas, we will need to learn to treat these in a responsible manner."
"Making more economical use of natural resources means treating them differently from how we treat them now."
"In other words, compared to our present way of doing things, we must use them differently."
"It is therefore of great importance to ensure that this is also reflected in the way emission rights are allocated."
"This is why, together with the PPE-DE Group, our group has tabled amendments in order to have a kind of benchmark included in the directive."
"The comparison of energy consumption levels to determine the allocation of emission rights is an extra incentive for companies to take measures in order to reduce their energy consumption."
"In this way, industry is offered the opportunity, based on mutual and historical comparison, to reduce CO2 emissions by consuming energy in an innovative way."
"This is a greater incentive than introducing an energy levy, and it also places some of the social responsibility with entrepreneurs and industry."
"Consequently, all the proposals tabled recently to weaken the directive and restrict its scope do not contribute towards improved energy policy in a constructive manner."
"Quite the reverse."
"Based on the idea that certain countries will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol, attempts are thus made to restrict the countries' own contribution so as not to experience any economic disadvantage."
"The fact that this idea is based on an incorrect assumption is self-evident."
"After all, a reduction in energy consumption makes sense from an economic point of view too."
"This has regrettably, led to many amendments being tabled which, if adopted, will seriously hamper the effectiveness of the emissions trading instrument."
"Voting in the various committees has demonstrated, though, that many amendments cannot therefore count on sufficient support."
"I am referring to the amendments that require other sectors to be added and that allow many exceptions to the rule."
"In addition, Amendment No 97 on co-incineration should be rejected, because it reinforces the uneven playing field of waste incineration plants versus co-incineration plants."
"Unlike waste incineration plants, real production processes take place at co-incineration plants, to which no exceptions should apply."
"This complicates the directive unnecessarily."
"I would therefore urge you not to support proposals of this kind."
"Mr President, I will wind up by saying that solutions for a better living environment and a better future are often not obvious, certainly not in today's economic climate."
"Not only the economic climate is a decisive factor in this matter, however."
"Our role as stewards of God's creation requires us to manage the earth and its resources well."
"I am absolutely convinced that this is of key significance for our commitment to the sustainable use of our Earth's resources."
"Emissions trading can be a means to this end."
"Mr President, twelve years have passed since Rio, where it was recognised that greenhouse gases have to be reduced around the world, which shows how interminably slowly global processes of change in relation to the environment take place."
"It is costs that are the main point under discussion."
"It must, though, become widely accepted that every measure taken today is the cause of only a fraction of the cost of future consequential damage, which has to be paid for later."
"That is what we have experienced in recent days in Central Europe, with the greatest flood disaster known to history."
"The water has now gone, but the causes remain, and so we have to take action against them, primarily locally but also globally."
"It is generally recognised that the most important step is the radical reduction in all greenhouse gases."
"Mr Moreira Da Silva's Report points in the right direction, and does so excellently."
"We need a long-term perspective that also involves our belief that real improvement can be achieved."
"We have been relieved to learn in recent weeks that, for example, the ban on hydrofluorocarbons has resulted, after only a few years, in the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic being reduced in size for the first time."
"Emissions trading in itself does not yet reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but simply divides them up in a different way."
"An effective campaign must start at our own front door."
"To do this, we must first of all develop renewable sources of energy and press on towards the energy efficiency goals that we have set ourselves."
"The long-term view can only be that the polluter-pays principle should be applied and that the revenues thus accrued should be earmarked for specific purposes and used to improve the situation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are voting on the directive on emissions trading in Europe."
"The European Union committed itself to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol."
"The Commission has now been working on a preliminary proposal on how to regulate emissions trading between European companies."
"It will set cap-and-trade values for our energy-dominated industry that are to be reduced annually in accordance with the Kyoto targets."
"It goes without saying that we in the European Union want to make our contribution to an improved environment and a reduction in emissions worldwide."
"I am in favour of the notion of global emissions trading as one way of cutting greenhouse gas emissions."
"The emissions market would, with all the natural efficiency of the free market, channel the reductions into those areas where the emissions are cheapest to cut."
"The overall cost of climate policy to the EU would also remain low as a consequence."
"The Commission proposal, however, contains several problem areas that need changing."
"Owing to the costs of making reductions in emissions, industrial competitiveness in EU countries will suffer in comparison with those countries that are outside the Kyoto agreement."
"There is a very clear danger that instead of actual cuts in emissions we will end up with emission leakage on a global scale, when European installations move their operations to countries that have not submitted to the burden sharing agreement that is Kyoto."
"The number of single companies that would have to buy allowances depends on how the initial allocation is made."
"The initial allocation must definitely be free of charge."
"An allocation that is auctioned and therefore paid for would mean EU companies would have the burden of an additional cost which their competitors outside the EU and operating in the international markets would not have."
"The initial allocation must not punish companies that deal with their own emissions effectively, and the measures that a company has already taken must be taken into account."
"For example, in my country, Finland, there have already been voluntary cuts in carbon dioxide emissions for more than a decade."
"85% of industry and power plants have already concluded a voluntary energy saving agreement with the government."
"The initial allocation process must also take account of a company's real potential technically and financially for limiting their emissions."
"For example, the steel industry in the area I come from cannot be allowed to get into a disadvantageous position merely because it is impossible to manufacture steel without producing a certain volume of carbon dioxide emissions."
"Coal is not used in the steel industry to produce energy but as part of the production process."
"Emissions have been effectively reduced by investing in modern technology."
"For this reason I, together with my colleagues in our group, have tabled an amendment that would make it possible to exclude carbonaceous products from the cap-and-trade system up to a limit that can be achieved with the best available technology."
"The Commission's proposal for a directive is more problematic for Finland than for many other countries."
"The sectors of industry it covers account for a large proportion of emissions in Finland, larger than in other countries."
"On the other hand, Finland would get just a small share of the allowances in the allocation, as national targets are stringent."
"In other words the total allowance will be small."
"This is not the case with other countries where there are no commitments whatsoever and where climate objectives even permit an increase in emissions."
"Although emissions trading is a cost-effective way to reduce emissions in theory, the proposal for a directive must not be allowed to impose any restrictions on commerce so that its benefits are not realised."
"In theory emissions trading is most advantageous for those whose own measures to reduce emissions are more expensive than buying emissions allowances from others."
"In practice the outcome, however, depends on how the allowances are allocated to the individual installations themselves, that is to say, how many installations will have to pay for emission allowances and what their market price will be."
"Distorting the competition structure within the same industrial sector both in Europe and in a global context is a danger, which must be closely looked at in any future debate on the proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Wallström started by describing how inadequate the European Union's climate protection measures have been up to now."
"It is for that reason that we want to negotiate another new instrument on emissions law."
"We all - myself included - say 'yes' to that."
"At the same time, though, I say that, if we break down the overall picture of emissions in the European Union, it can be observed that some are already heavily involved in reducing greenhouse gases and others are not."
"I believe that we must not allow this additional new instrument to call into question the efforts that have already - and with some success - been made, and in view of which we should not be using a straitjacket to wreck structures that have been successful in reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gases."
"This means that there are two things I see as important: the first is greater flexibility, and the second is fair conditions."
"If I may start with greater flexibility, I know a business in my part of the world, which has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 27% since 1990."
"Why on earth should this business join the emissions trading system, when it has good business reasons for saying that it does not want to?"
"On the other hand, there is a business that is interested, even though it is not covered by the directive."
"Having themselves reduced CO2, they are happy to join in. In so far, I am in favour of making it possible to opt in and out."
"Opting in, as provided for in the proposal from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, strikes me as completely satisfactory, whereas opting out does not; the two are not parallel, in that one can opt out only up to 31 December 2007."
"I therefore want to put the case for leaving the conditions equal, so that if someone leaves, he is not wholly exempted, but must comply with the same emission reductions as he would if he were still in, but without this 2007 deadline."
"I would therefore like to urge you to vote in favour of Amendment No 81."
"I now turn to the second area, which has to do with fair conditions."
"We must of course ensure that businesses that get stuck in and have already made the effort since 1990 should have this taken into account when emission allowances are handed out."
"Moreover, it is not acceptable that closures and relocations of firms should be brought into play to acquire emission allowances that are then sold at a profit, thus putting jobs at risk."
"These emission allowances must lapse."
"If we take the two together - flexibility and fair conditions - it will be with a clear conscience that we can say 'yes' to using emissions trading to protect the climate, but under flexible and fair conditions."
"Mr President, I believe that the Commission proposal forms an excellent basis."
"Everyone must be involved and the initial allocation of rights is free."
"There is, however, one snag; the risk of distortion of competition within the EU."
"In other words, the playing field may become too uneven, and you were right, Commissioner, to point out that this is unacceptable among national allocation schemes."
"This is also why I am opposed to national exemptions, whereby a country can grant a company or a sector exemption."
"It is my conviction that everyone should take part."
"If necessary, exemptions may be granted at European level for one or other clear reason which can be objectively established."
"In addition, I am of the opinion that the allocation must also take account of the energy efficiency of the technology used in a company."
"A company that does not work efficiently should not be rewarded with an initial generous allocation of rights for free."
"Since it is impossible to sell because a high number of sectors must operate in a global market, and would therefore be disadvantaged by this sale, European allocation criteria should be put into place that are objective, transparent and stringent and that apply to everyone."
"We need a benchmark, the best available technology, and we need to prescribe compulsory criteria based on these for everyone and every Member State, since this scheme also affects the distribution of the burden across the Member States in one way or another."
"There is the chance therefore, and unfortunately the Member States that are experiencing difficulties are nearly all small Member States, which makes the discussion for us highly problematic, in that there is distortion of competition, which does not mean that we reject this scheme, because this scheme, for us who are finding it difficult to cope, makes the effort more bearable and cheaper, as the price of the effort is reduced."
"This is why we need an effective scheme."
"We will at any rate need to adjust this scheme along the way, and we will at any rate be facing climate problems, greenhouse gases, measures which we need to take long after 2012."
"We should be clear about one thing: it is impossible to build an ecological paradise on an economic graveyard."
"Mr President, to prevent global climatic change the United States of America proposed a worldwide system of greenhouse gas emissions trading and the creation of emission allowance markets for that purpose."
"However, the United States did not join the scheme, which is to get under way at the start of 2008."
"The Commission has suggested that the cap-and-trade scheme, which the United States rejected, should commence in 2005."
"The same mandatory system has been proposed for everyone, with reductions in emissions being based on market mechanisms."
"With this instrument a market is to be created. The fact that it is a market will not bring about a reduction in emissions."
"The radio spectrum auctions in the European market were a catastrophe."
"Besides, the Commission proposal is not a market mechanism."
"It involves an administrative distribution of emission allowances among countries as well as the different companies located in them."
"Crucial to the scheme's success is the initial allocation, and that is not a market mechanism."
"Companies in countries that have set themselves ambitious targets in emission cuts will be at a disadvantage compared with the others."
"The companies that have reduced their emissions before the allowances become effective will be punished."
"For them it will be more expensive to increase low-emission production than for companies which produce large volumes of emissions."
"Those countries and companies that use a lot of nuclear or hydroelectric power are being favoured."
"The EU trade in emission allowances should not be mandatory before 2008: until then let it be an optional pilot project for Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make it clear, before I say anything else, that I am not, today, speaking on behalf of the CDU/CSU delegation to the European Parliament."
"The majority of that delegation takes a different line, but I am speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, which supports the key points of the Moreira Da Silva Report as voted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I wish to express my support for the report, and my gratitude to the rapporteur for his commitment."
"The negotiations were not always easy to conduct - he had to agree to compromises that were difficult for his country in particular - and he therefore merits our especial appreciation."
"The compromises were difficult for Portugal, but they were reasonable and helpful to the matter in hand."
"Protecting the climate will be one of the greatest challenges in coming decades."
"We should at last stop depicting business and the protection of the climate as being polar opposites."
"The terrible floods in Germany and the countries bordering it have made it clear to us that great damage is done also in economic terms if we do not protect the climate."
"These floods were, of course, far from an undisputed side-effect of climate change - to what extent they were is still a matter of academic debate - but the experts do not dispute that we have to do something to avoid such catastrophes in the future."
"It is therefore right that the Commission should put forward proposals on this, but also true, as we in this House agree, that the Commission proposal before us has major defects, and discussion in the Committees has centred on what we do about them."
"One group at first tried to reject the Commission proposal as a whole, and when that failed, to at least water it down."
"Another group, among whom I count myself, declared that the proposal had to be improved."
"'Improve it, yes; water it down, no!' was the guiding principle with which we set to work, and I believe that the Environment Committee's report has indeed eradicated the Commission proposal's principal weaknesses."
"What is most important is the acceptance of 1990 as a base year and the acknowledgement of previous achievements by businesses."
"In Germany, Great Britain, Finland and other countries where something has already been done, it is quite simply incomprehensible that one should be penalised for having already made a start on protecting the climate."
"That is what makes our introduction of the base year and the recognition of previous achievements so important, so that the firms that have done something can also be given proper credit for it, and then they will have a chance to make a profit from trading in greenhouse gas emission allowances."
"There are other improvements, to which Mr Lange has referred; in order that the closure of a plant and the loss of jobs may not then be credited as a climate protection measure, we have adopted an amendment to the effect that emissions certificates will be withdrawn if a production site is closed down."
"The PPE-DE Group has tabled another twelve amendments, which we have decided on unanimously in order to make further improvements to the Moreira Da Silva Report, but without affecting the heart of the compromises."
"The most important amendment in this area concerns how we should deal with the cement and chalk industry."
"It is a fact that it is more difficult to avoid emissions of CO2 in the production of chalk and cement than it is in other fields, and so this must be taken into consideration without jeopardising the overall objective."
"Along with the majority of the PPE-DE Group, I am personally opposed to any opt-out for whole countries and especially to the grant of any opt-out without prior conditions."
"Even in the initial stages, we cannot talk in terms of an opt-out unless there are very definite prior conditions, which must themselves be subject to immediate verification."
"Emissions trading is the market economy's tool for protecting the climate, and, believing as I do in the market economy, I am in favour of the Moreira Da Silva Report and ask my fellow Members of this House to vote in support of it."
"Mr President, I would also like to begin by signing up to Mr Moreira Da Silva's fan club and thank him for an excellent job."
"I would also like to thank him for an excellent round table discussion yesterday evening, which I thought was level-headed and balanced and also made a great contribution to the debate."
"Also, I would like to express thanks for the Commission's document, which provides a very good basis."
"In view of the limited time available, perhaps we ought to have adopted the proposal unamended."
"Parliament has, however, proposed a number of amendments."
"I have some opinions about which aspects should be considered when we discuss systems for trading in emission rights."
"We have three commitments to take into account."
"We must ensure that climate change is reduced."
"We must ensure that our industry, for which this system was created, also has the opportunity to compete on equal terms."
"In addition, we have international commitments like the Kyoto Protocol to fulfil and maintain, and we cannot therefore change the basic rules."
"In order for the system to function, I think that the following six points must be complied with."
"The system must be simple; it must be administratively simple."
"We cannot create a complicated system that the participants, above all, businesses, do not understand."
"The system must obviously be mandatory."
"After all, we cannot create a playing field where some players say: 'No, I do not want to join in right now, so I am quitting and sitting on the sidelines instead'."
"We have to know who will be included in the system, and it is obvious that it must involve countries and individual installations."
"I also think that it would have been desirable to allocate emission rights using an auction procedure."
"There are many views on how the allocation should proceed."
"The compromise now to be voted on is based on up to 95% allocation free of charge and 5% by auction during the first period, and I think that this is a good solution."
"This way, we have at least an element of auction, which fits better with the 'polluter pays' principle."
"It goes without saying that the emission ceiling must be binding and connected to an enforcement system."
"Just like the rapporteur, I think that the system should include more gases than just carbon dioxide."
"There has also been discussion as to whether it should be possible to carry over emission rights from year to year, and I think this is right."
"Enterprises that do not use up their emission rights during one year should be able to carry them over to the next year."
"We also need to highlight certain aspects and emphasise that this must be in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. We cannot invent something new."
"Above all, I wish to urge the Council to ensure that it makes a decision on 17 October."
"Mr President, the Union's goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is justified, but the solution - as is often the case with EU decisions - is bureaucratic and costly."
"More attention has been focused on the minutiae of the scheme than actually reducing emissions."
"Furthermore, it treats different Member States unfairly, depending on such matters as industrial structure and the structure of energy production as well as how much has already been done to reduce emissions."
"We all agree about what our aim should be."
"The Kyoto commitments must be fulfilled."
"There has been a lot of criticism of the emissions trading scheme."
"It will be especially difficult for steel mills struggling in the global market that have plans for expansion and have already done a lot to reduce emissions."
"A poor proposal was put forward by the Commission, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy made a lot of improvements to it, but they got watered down when the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy debated it."
"I hope that when we vote we will be able to improve the proposal by approving changes to it that will allow a less rigid opt-out practice and exclude carbon dioxide from raw materials from the calculation of allowances."
"I do not believe that auctions and burden sharing ceilings by country are appropriate in this connection."
"The telecommunications sector showed us that auctions are not to be recommended."
"The problems associated with emissions trading apply to many industrial sectors throughout Europe."
"Thousands of jobs in industry are involved."
"The danger is that production will move somewhere else, where it will cause more pollution."
"Mr President, can I start by thanking the rapporteur for the care and dedication he has shown in respect of this topic?"
"He was, and still is, receptive to the problems that this proposal entails."
"I should like to thank him for, and congratulate him on, the enormous skill, but certainly also on the perseverance with which he is attempting to bring the emissions trading scheme to a successful end."
"I share Mr Liese's view that the rapporteur has not opted for the southern European angle, but has tried to join North and South together in a very judicious way."
"The proposal is an outworking of Kyoto, where it was agreed that the emission of greenhouse gases was to be reduced."
"I am able to say, with due pride, that the emissions trading scheme is already working well in the Member State from which I come."
"A sound emissions trading scheme must meet a number of criteria: it should not discriminate between companies and sectors and it should reward pioneers for the measures they have already taken."
"I will return to this subject in a moment."
"The scheme must not obstruct the market and must therefore also provide opportunities to newcomers on the market."
"Furthermore, the scheme must be competitive in Europe and may not adversely affect the European position on the global market."
"In my view, the Commission proposal does not meet these criteria."
"A cap or a trading scheme can be achieved by auctioning or grandfathering."
"Auctioning would be a solution if the market were to function well, but if auctioning takes place only in Europe, competitiveness with the rest of the world is distorted."
"The main disadvantage of grandfathering is that the rights are initially allocated for free on the basis of the emissions at the time."
"Such a scheme of grandfathering, therefore, takes no account whatsoever of the reductions in energy consumption which have already been introduced within the Dutch market, and certainly in the German one, and also in a number of other countries."
"This is why I believe it would be best to set up a scheme whereby rights are allocated on the basis of performance standard rates. These are rights that must be earned first by operating more energy-efficiently before they can be auctioned."
"I wholeheartedly support the adapted proposal, which includes a number of the amendments that I have tabled on behalf of my group."
"And I should like to say to my German fellow MEPs that I understand their view."
"Mr President, the Kyoto Protocol was widely welcomed as an important step in combating the climate changes threatening life on our planet."
"However, under pressure from the USA, the protocol contains a loophole which allows countries or companies to avoid honouring their commitments."
"I refer to the system of greenhouse gas emissions trading."
"It is unthinkable that an entire market should be created in order to trade in pollution as a commodity, a market on which, instead of reducing their emissions, companies can buy surplus emissions from other companies which are within their limits."
"It is equally unthinkable that people should cite the right to pollute."
"Taken in conjunction with the famous 'polluter pays' principle, this means that anyone who can pay the price has a licence to pollute with impunity."
"We are horrified that the European Union has based its policy for implementing the Kyoto Protocol on emissions trading and is addressing the whole problem in market terms."
"This shows just how hypocritical its proclamations on the environment and climate are."
"In theory it supports the Kyoto Protocol; in practice it undermines it."
"Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and allowing monopolies to keep making obscene profits are mutually exclusive."
"Of course, in the capitalist system, everything can be bought and sold, even pollution."
"However, climate and the future of life on our planet cannot be bought and sold."
"The protection of our planet is in the hands of the grass-roots movement."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Moreira Da Silva, who, by dint of a vast amount of detailed work, has made a useable proposal for discussion out of a very poor proposal from the Commission, one that actually ought to have been rejected outright."
"So, many thanks to him, for what your office, Mrs Wallström, has produced, is not up to the standard of quality needed if protection of the environment is to make progress across Europe."
"Not in eight and a half years have I come across such a poor proposal for a directive put to this House, so you can be grateful that Parliament eventually had the opportunity to improve certain aspects of this feeble effort."
"So much for my introductory remarks."
"My second point is that I unreservedly agree with Mr Lange that, if this proposal is to become reality, it must incorporate flexibility under fair conditions."
"Fair conditions are required not only because individual Member States of the European Union have already achieved a great deal whilst others have not, but also in view of the relevance of emissions trading to competition."
"Everyone imaginable in this House has had something to say about the USA and the bad guys over there, only then to say that this is actually a tax on energy."
"Mrs Corbey said that electricity produced by nuclear power must not receive favourable treatment."
"What the Commission has proposed does not actually meet its own conditions."
"It is a bureaucratic monster, utterly ineffective in environmental terms, and this cannot be blamed on Kyoto and justified by reference to it, because Kyoto, Mrs Wallström, was signed by the Member States."
"In Kyoto, the Member States committed themselves."
"The Kyoto Protocol refers to six greenhouse gases, you to only one."
"The Kyoto Protocol commits the Member States."
"You want to impose obligations on businesses."
"The Kyoto Protocol puts the Member States in a position to make use of any instrument."
"You want to make the Member States' responsibility null and void by using the Commission's bureaucracy."
"The Kyoto Protocol is effective from 2008 to 2012."
"Your mandatory emissions trading begins as early as 2005."
"The Kyoto Protocol has at least three instruments, of which you use only one, and, most of all, you violate the most important principle, one on which the international community has agreed, that the world at large should cut back on CO2 wherever this can be done most cheaply and quickly. It is quite clear, though, that what you are proposing here is European internal trade, which will not have any effect on anyone else, and will cost between EUR 20 and EUR 33 per ton of CO2 equivalent."
"You have incorporated neither of the other two instruments in your directive at all."
"The Kyoto Protocol strives for a mix in which the cost of EUR 6 per tonne of CO2 equivalent should apply, and if you do as you have proposed, the result will be factories being closed down and jobs being relocated."
"We will achieve no positive outcome on a worldwide basis, and that is why we are in favour not only of fair conditions, but also of letting the instruments compete until the Kyoto Protocol takes effect."
"All fifteen Member States of the European Union have now undertaken to individually reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8%."
"The European Union has committed itself to something different, a different kind of burden sharing."
"The way this sort of burden-sharing works is that a country such as Germany, with its minus 21%, is playing a very large part, whereas Portugal, for example, is permitted an increase of a further 27% over against the 1990 basis."
"This is all very just and responsible, but now, when Germany and Great Britain are the only states to be able, even without the Commission's bureaucratic emission-trading monster, to point to successes, you cannot penalise them on the basis that those who did it voluntarily must now pay an additional penalty for having made a success of it."
"How, Mrs Wallström, is that sort of imposition on the Member States and on businesses meant to motivate them?"
"As a German MEP, I can tell you that there have been reductions of CO2-equivalent in Germany amounting to 231 million tonnes since 1990."
"That is a massive amount."
"Over the same period, Spain, another Member State, has poured another 100 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent into the atmosphere."
"Penalising German businesses for Spanish omissions is the wrong way to go about things, and so I ask the House to support item 75, which is intended to give more responsibility to the Member States."
"Mr President, if I had more than two minutes at my disposal, I would, in the most amicable way possible, demolish Mr Langen's arguments."
"I do believe that the Commission has produced a thoroughly good draft, which I am sure we have improved, because Parliament always does everything better."
"I want to make the following points."
"Firstly, we already have a trade in emissions; across the world, some 70 million tonnes of CO2 have been traded since 1996, at - let us assume - a price of USD 3 per tonne, amounting to USD 210 million worth of business, and the trade is increasing at an exponential rate."
"There has to be some order in this trade, and, in Europe, this directive helps us to do that."
"That is why it makes sense."
"I am very much in favour of past experience in the Member States being taken into account, which means that we need a transitional period, but one that must come to an end."
"As far as I am concerned, 2008 is that end, when the same rule must apply across Europe."
"I also want to point out that European competition law still applies to trading in emissions, and - Kyoto notwithstanding - the Commission can always intervene in the market if it believes that competition is being distorted."
"This trade in emissions is in fact ushering in a new era in our economy, as waste gases - CO2 in this instance - are having a price put on them."
"Where that price is estimated - the Commission is assuming EUR 20 per tonne - one can very readily imagine what significance this will have for the economy, for the energy sector, and for ecology."
"We really are coming up to a paradigm shift, and, that being so, I am sure that this will not be the last debate on this subject."
"I hope that Parliament's resolution will after all be the basis of a rapprochement between us, enabling us to come up with a solution that makes sense."
"Mr President, I would like to start with very warm thanks to Mr Moreira Da Silva, who was a superb rapporteur, and he has produced a fine report."
"ET, Emission tradit is a strange unknown being from a strange unknown star."
"We do not yet know whether to fear it or love it."
"I have, though, attempted to give this being a rather more human face and have brought in a series of amendments, some of which have also been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Amendment No 2: if the authorities already have to update this by making various changes to the installations, then please let this happen with the operators' agreement."
"The Commission states in its draft that it will stipulate a harmonised method of allocation for the period beginning on 1 January 2008."
"I would rather that they did not."
"I believe that Parliament has the right to be involved in this by way of the codecision procedure."
"My concern in Amendment No 30 is that the allocation of allowances to new installations should, in principle, be harmonised across the EU."
"My Amendment No 37 is particularly important."
"This has to do with need for the Member States to ensure that the operators of installations can, within the relevant periods, bring forward allowances or put them aside for a subsequent year."
"This strikes me as very, very important, and makes things a bit more workable."
"It is my belief that none of us needs to fear this draft."
"After all, we are dealing only with the period from 2005 to the end of 2010, which the Commission has already designated as a sort of test run."
"Fear not, my good brave Mr Langen; we can keep on changing all this."
"I am sure that it will be only after today's vote that we will really get started on a major discussion process."
"Mr President, we - by which I mean not only the economic actors, but also the Member States and the European Union - have to stand firm on implementing the Kyoto Protocol."
"Mr Langen should not forget that we live in an internal market which is not meant to function in such a way that the lights go out all over Europe, but rather so that we try to create ecologically compatible and sustainable economic growth in the interests of employment and of saving the environment."
"This, in my view, makes it very right and proper that the Commission should take note of the fact that certain Member States are already engaged in emissions trading, and that, as has repeatedly been said today, certain of them already have previous achievements to their name in reducing carbon dioxide."
"This makes it particularly important that we should take 1990 as a base year."
"Let me, moreover, make the economic point that it is extraordinarily important that emissions certificates be granted free of charge."
"There is nothing to be gained from auctions; we have been shown that by our bitter experiences in the past, from the trade in banana licences to the auctioning of UMTS licences, and that is why it matters that this instrument should be granted free of charge."
"It is important from the investor's point of view, as this will not lead to enterprises being harmed by costs at the outset and this will also ensure that emissions trading does not work like a tax."
"Enterprises thus have at their disposal the resources they need for research and development and for the use of energy-saving, low-emission processes."
"Allocation without charge also guarantees that all involved are on an equal footing and that the procedure is transparent."
"I consider that to be of the utmost importance, and I must say that we welcome this proposal on economic grounds as well, because it ends up helping the price to take account of external costs."
"I would, though, beg the Commission to do everything possible to achieve a breakthrough on the taxation framework directive as well, as it cannot but help to supplement taxes on business and thus help Europe to successfully realise ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, this is a report that is certainly of great importance."
"It only remains to be seen whether it will have a negative or positive impact on real life. Then it will be a question of real companies and real people's jobs, real families' livelihoods and genuine climatic change."
"It is an experiment, in which the EU cannot afford to fail."
"In principle I eagerly support emissions trading, but it has to be said that this proposal is worryingly incomplete."
"The Commission proposal, among other things, failed to answer the following questions. Firstly, there is the competitiveness of companies that implemented environmental action in the early stages, taking special account of the limits for individual countries as a result of burden sharing."
"Then there are the competition-distorting factors of burden sharing among the Member States generally, the relationship between emissions trading and the fiscal interests of individual states, and that between emissions trading and the free energy market."
"Then, too, there are the issues of the massive transfers of income arising from cooperative action between different operators and states, enlargement, the EU shielding itself from attacks from third country operators or Soros-type speculators, and matters to do with legal protection, and access to justice. The latter the committee fortunately accepted in my proposal."
"In addition to the questions that still remain unclear, the proposal seems to confuse the goals and means of achieving them, the national level and that of business, and market instruments and traditional administration based on control."
"In confusing these it serves its purpose poorly and needlessly puts a burden on the objective itself, which is to reduce emissions, regarding which European operators have until now been unanimous."
"Uncommonly burdensome levels of bureaucracy accompanying the emissions trading scheme, bureaucracy that Parliament, regrettably, has not been willing to bear the responsibility for breaking down, promise additional difficulties."
"I have been especially anxious about the possibility of carbon leakage."
"Without my amendment the directive would not distinguish between carbon dioxide emissions that result from the use of coal for energy and its use as part of an industrial process."
"As a result the position of the European steel industry, which meets excellent global ecological standards, would be in danger of being weakened in the global markets, causing not only economic but also massive ecological harm."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my thanks for the valuable and constructive contributions to a very interesting debate."
"This is not the first time and, believe me, definitely not the last time that we will discuss measures to counter climate change."
"Allow me to begin by placing this debate in a wider context, that is to say, what we know about climate change."
"We are well aware that climate change is taking place."
"The rise in temperature we have measured during the twentieth century is the biggest for a thousand years."
"We know that the snow cover in the northern hemisphere has decreased by 10% since the end of the 1960s."
"We know that the thickness of the polar icecap had decreased by 40% in just a decade."
"Researchers - and we have assembled the world's leading climate researchers - say that, to deal with climate change, we will have to go much, much further than the Kyoto Protocol."
"We will therefore need to take measures that go further than those we have discussed up to now."
"We have ratified the Kyoto Protocol and are now in fact working, within the EU, on three different fronts."
"We are acting on the international scene by encouraging countries on the outside, such as the US, to sign up."
"It is important to continue pushing for good conditions and for the achievement of those objectives of the Kyoto Protocol that are within reach."
"We must, however, be credible here at home too, and that is why we have set up the European Climate Change Programme."
"Together with all the various interested parties, we have identified those measures we need to take here at home in order to meet our commitments and combat climate change in a cost-effective manner."
"The trade in emissions rights is one such instrument."
"I will just add that we all realise that there is a cost in meeting the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, but it will also be to our cost if we refrain from acting."
"To do as others do and sit on the sidelines or refrain from doing anything cannot be considered as a contribution to the creation of equitable conditions."
"It is necessary to remember this."
"The trade in emission rights is thus one of the instruments we will need in future."
"We have just been talking about large emission sources, but we also need to review the traffic system and take effective measures in this connection in future."
"I would like to thank you very much, Commissioner, not only for participating in the debate but also for your commitment to the issue."
"The debate is closed."
"It is with great pleasure that I extend a most cordial welcome to a delegation from the Great Hural, the Parliament of the Republic of Mongolia, headed by His Excellency Mr Sanjbegziyn Tumur-Ochir, Speaker of the Great Hural."
"The members of the delegation have taken their seats in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery."
"This visit to Brussels by the Speaker of the Mongolian Parliament is a great honour and further evidence of the strengthening of the relations established between the European Union and the Republic of Mongolia."
"I am sure that the talks between the members of the Mongolian delegation and the various Members of our Parliament today and yesterday will have been fruitful and serve to strengthen the bilateral links between our two institutions."
"You are very welcome."
"Mr President, I will be very brief, for we have discussed this report at length, and just highlight new points which have emerged from a very heated debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"This is actually the twenty-third amendment of Council Directive 76/769 relating to restrictions on the marketing of substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction - a directive, therefore, which seeks to protect consumers' health and to harmonise the common market in products with the same characteristics."
"As stated in Annex I, the proposal relates to 25 new substances classified as category 2, 14 of which are considered to be carcinogens - cobalt salts, some cadmium salts, benzopyrene and some azoic dyes which have been recorded for years in literature as having carcinogenic properties have, at last, been included - three of which are considered to be mutagens and eight of which are considered to be toxic to reproduction."
"As well as substances such as these, the ban is extended by the Commission to preparations, that is to mixtures or solutions of these substances."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, particularly Mrs Schörling and a number of other Members, would like to see the ban extended to the marketing of products and articles containing these substances, such as toys, textiles or flooring, too."
"I would stress that I am opposed to the idea of extending the ban to products as well."
"Consider the damage it would cause, not just in economic, commercial and industrial terms but the psychological damage too, should people learn that one of these substances - an azoic dye, for example - is present in an elegant tie, whereas, in actual fact, the carcinogenic substances are never released from that tie and the health of the person wearing it is therefore never placed at risk."
"I will therefore confirm our position."
"We are opposed to Amendment No 1, tabled by Mrs Schörling, which was only endorsed by the Committee on the Environment by a very small majority and which states that 'the Commission should extend the ban on substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction...to products...'."
"We are also opposed to the first part of Amendment No 2 - the first seven lines - which states once again that '...the ban should be extended...to products...'."
"However, we accept the second part of Amendment No 2, which seeks to put pressure on the Commission, recommending that the Commission submit a proposal to prohibit the use of products containing mutagenic or carcinogenic substances where there is scientific evidence that these dangerous substances are actually released from the products and absorbed and accumulated by the human body in concentrations with mutagenic, carcinogenic or toxic effect."
"I believe that this recommendation will contribute greatly to the protection of consumer health and the environment, and I hope, Mr President, that the Commission and the Council will be able to incorporate it."
"Mr President, this second reading is incredibly important, since it deals with the twenty-third amendment to the directive on restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction), the so-called CMR substances."
"Neither the Council nor the Commission have wanted to meet the European Parliament halfway in our demand for the directive to include products as well."
"After all, products are the main source of exposure for the public, for example in toys, textiles or flooring."
"The risk assessment carried out in accordance with the Commission's proposal is actually based on the precautionary principle and states clearly that the safety of the public is to be guaranteed."
"This can only be brought about if there is also a ban on CMR substances in consumer goods."
"For some obscure reason, the Commission and the Council have not wanted to accept this, despite there being scientific evidence."
"The Council also points out that a large number of products are involved and that this is supposedly a reason for not doing anything."
"It should in fact be the other way round."
"If a large number of products contain CMR substances, we should obviously act even faster."
"I would have preferred to see a proposal for a ban as early as 2002, but we have not been able to get that far."
"It is always a pleasure to work with the gentlemanly Dr Nisticò."
"We have been able to produce a constructive amendment, a compromise between Dr Nisticò and fellow Members from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"I would urge fellow Members to vote in favour of Amendment No 2."
"We cannot wait any longer."
"It is irresponsible to do so, nor is it in accordance with the precautionary principle."
"I appeal to fellow Members: vote in favour of Amendment No 2."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialists I welcome this report which will place serious and proper restrictions on a number of very dangerous substances that are now known to be toxic, mutagenic or carcinogenic to human beings."
"We must push this report through."
"As regards the critical issue here, which is the extension of this ban to products, the Socialist Group fully supports the second amendment which proposes this idea."
"We recognise, of course, that further work needs to be done on this question."
"We must consider these products, the level of risk they present, their contact with human beings and the places where they are used."
"We believe, however, that this can happen further down in the legislative process."
"This amendment should be supported so that these discussions can take place."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"The next item is the vote."
"Mr President, I am prepared to withdraw Amendment No 10 if the House accepts the following oral amendment: we would retain the whole of paragraph 5 but the final part of the sentence would be amended as follows: instead of 'international NGOs that wish to enter Algerian territory freely', I propose 'international NGOs that wish to have access to Algerian territory'."
"Mr President, I would like to say that my group is withdrawing the first part of the amendment. What will remain will therefore be: 'requests that the Commission carry out a regular assessment of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the implementation of the Association Agreement'."
"Mr President, the Liberals have tabled an Amendment, No 2, but I have consulted Mrs Bastos who has assured me that the text that we wanted to add about the local and regional governments' involvement in the consultation in the border regions is already implicitly included in her text."
"I should, for that reason therefore, like to withdraw the amendment."
"- (NL) There is a desperate need for financial support for all eastern European countries, where, over the past decade, economies have collapsed and where no great improvements are expected in the foreseeable future."
"Bosnia-Herzegovina is a special case."
"Since 1992, when the separation of this former Turkish province from Yugoslavia gained international approval, attempts have been made continually from the outside to create one state and to gather support from that country's inhabitants for this purpose."
"In actual fact, however, it is a state that does not belong to anyone."
"It is a country simply made up of ethnic minorities."
"Only the largest minority wanted this country and considers this as the country of the people who were Islamised under Turkish rule."
"The two other groups, who felt slighted in the Turkish era, now feel more in tune with the neighbouring states Serbia or Croatia."
"They experience the state borders that separate them from these countries these days as hindrances, and would like to see them removed as quickly as possible."
"The latest election result is still being counted, but it is expected that the electorate has once again voted for different, conflicting nationalist movements, and that, in other words, the three groups each want a separate future."
"How long do we intend to keep that country artificially alive with military power, leaders appointed from outside and external sources of funding?"
"Our attempts will eventually result in failure once that country has survived the present difficult time."
"- (PT) I voted in favour of this report because I believe it makes a very valuable contribution towards the process of improving evaluation as a tool for assessing the implementation of the EU's objectives."
"I also share the view that systematic evaluation is a prime instrument to ensure value for money for expenditure from the EU budget. Like the rapporteur, I also welcome and recognise the Commission's efforts to develop a general evaluation culture in the institution."
"Lastly, I fully agree with the call for the Council to follow strict cost/benefit criteria when requesting evaluation reports but I am also aware that the most difficult task is to integrate evaluation findings into future policy, budgetary orientations and resource allocation."
"- (PT) We cannot overemphasise the importance of support instruments for small and medium-sized undertakings, which play a crucial role in job creation, in the impetus for investment and in the economic growth of the Member States and the European Union."
"I fully agreed with the rapporteur's very positive assessment of the overall results achieved in 2001, in terms of the initiative's development and its impact on employment."
"The Commission report itself is relatively thorough, and the Commission has clearly responded to Parliament's request for greater speed and urgency in producing it, although it is regrettable that some specific comments made by Parliament in its report last year have still not been taken into account, particularly with regard to information on hearings."
"I also support the request to the Commission to present solutions to replace the 'Joint European Venture' (JEV), whose benefits have been hard to see and which is inadequate in its current form, as well as the following observation, which I believe to be of strategic importance and which is becoming crucial as enlargement approaches: 'the importance of stimulating investments and entrepreneurship in the candidate countries'."
"- (PT) Although it contains some contradictory and even negative aspects, the report makes significant improvements to the proposal for a directive submitted by the Commission."
"It accepts some proposals for amendments tabled by our group as well as others, which improve the text and which we shall be supporting."
"We welcome the fact that it puts forward measures intended to ensure compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, despite the USA's unacceptable position of refusing to ratify it."
"Nevertheless, the Commission proposal on the trading of greenhouse gas emissions allowances has not been sufficiently amended and so we abstained from the vote because we do not accept this principle, and we also have reservations about various other proposals for amendments."
"- (NL) Mr Bob van den Bos and Mrs Lousewies van der Laan (D66 party [Dutch Democratic '66 party]) have voted against Mr Obiols I Germa's legislative resolution to conclude an association agreement with Algeria."
"They did, however, vote in favour of the resolution tabled by Mr Brok."
"Algeria is at the moment going through a very unstable period, facing all kinds of violence and showing little evidence of democracy."
"Human rights are still being violated on a large scale."
"It would be a wrong signal to reward that country with an agreement precisely at this time."
"D66 considers an association agreement with Algeria in this form unacceptable, because the means to enforce the human rights clause is lacking."
"As is also underlined in the Brok resolution, the evaluation instruments for the application of the human rights clause in the association agreements are inadequate."
"D66 is of the opinion that adequate instruments to enforce the human rights clause are to be sought before the agreement can have the desired effect, that of improving human rights in Algeria."
"- (PT) Obviously, I have supported the setting up of this Fund, which expresses the solidarity of the entire European Union in light of major natural disasters that have taken place in various Member States. I have also supported most of the positions adopted by the rapporteur."
"In this brief explanation of vote, however, what I wish to highlight is that it was our colleague, Franz Turchi, from the UEN Group, who had already tabled a proposal to this effect two years ago, which was regrettably not given a favourable response."
"It took two further years without action and specifically, the serious floods that took place in August in Germany, Austria and in some candidate countries, to persuade the European Union to close a legislative loophole that was preventing the Community institutions from intervening in terms of providing financial assistance for the European communities that have suffered major natural disasters, a scourge that appears to be taking place with increasing frequency."
"I suppose we could say 'better late than never'."
"- (PT) The report following up the Commission proposal contains various contradictions and negative aspects, specifically in its insistence on advocating temporary work as a response to the problem of unemployment, despite the proposals that we tabled to improve it."
"Unfortunately, not all of them were accepted."
"Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that the proposal I tabled designed to protect workers' rights to a high-quality job with rights has been included."
"Equally positive is the report's insistence on the mutual recognition of qualifications, and its call for greater attention to be paid to early school leaving, to lifelong learning and to encouraging the learning of foreign languages, amongst other things."
"Hence our abstention from the vote."
"- (NL) This non-legislative report is brimming with fine things and statements of the obvious."
"Of course, more women must be able to find work in knowledge-intensive sectors, such as information and communication technology."
"In addition, it sounds good that a 'Statute for European Employees' should be drafted, a European system of labour legislation and social security for mobile employees."
"This fits in with the questions I am asking the Commission today about the Polish construction workers who work without collective labour agreements."
"However, the gist of the proposal is about adapting people to suit the work, rather than adapting the work to suit the people."
"It provides recipes for the way in which a labour market can function more effectively by better tailoring education to work."
"It intends to make it easier for people to move thousands of kilometres to regions with a different language and a different culture, where the scope for employment happens to be greater."
"If people really want to move, it is self-evidently a good thing that their qualifications should be valid even far away from home and that they should be able to take their pension rights with them. Most people, however, do not want this, with good reason."
"Europe is not America, where, out of financial necessity, people are forced to move such distances, which cuts them off from their families and friends."
"Let things stay that way."
"- (PT) As I advocated in my own report, around a year ago, on the performance of Eures in the 1998/99 period, the steps that have been taken, in the European Union, to increase professional mobility and to give all citizens access to this mobility are extremely important."
"I support the measures designed to promote cooperation in the field of education and training with the aim of establishing a common framework for the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, in cooperation with the social partners and educational and professional training establishments."
"I would also underline again the importance of launching a campaign to raise awareness of the possibilities opened up by the internal market and by the European employment market and of updating the Eures system (so that all the information it collates reaches people seeking work and employers), as well as a permanent mechanism for analysing the obstacles to geographical mobility."
"I regret, however, that the initial text drafted by Mrs Bastos, which was balanced and realistic, has been distorted by amendments that gave it a negative and interventionist nature and an ideological political vision that is totally inappropriate in the field of skills and mobility."
"We wish to emphasise that, at present, we consider cooperation through Eurojust to be the preferred form of prosecution cooperation within the EU."
"The jurisdiction for a possible common European prosecuting authority for financial crimes should be limited to cases of fraud directed against the European institutions."
"- (DA) The Commission has presented another communication on the combating of fraud."
"It will make it possible to exclude firms that have engaged in fraud from contracts with the Commission."
"The fact is, however, that that possibility exists already."
"It is unnecessary to prepare more communications."
"The Commission has only to use the 1992 directive relating to the award of public contracts, which makes it abundantly clear that it can exclude firms that have submitted false information or evaded tax from participating in the award of public contracts."
"Why not use this directive?"
"Why not use the existing legislation?"
"I have voted in favour of the Bösch Report because it draws attention to a good example of this obvious scandal."
"For years, Eurostat has entered into contracts with a firm that has supplied false information. This is shown by a cursory comparison of the figures."
"The Commission says that it handed the matter over to OLAF as early as 1999."
"Why, therefore, has nothing happened?"
"The firm, which submits incorrect figures year after year, is now on the Commission's top-ten list of most frequently used contractors."
"How can that be the case?"
"The Commission owes us a very good explanation."
"A patently fraudulent firm earns tremendous amounts of money out of contracts with the Commission."
"The firm sits over there in Luxembourg and laughs at us, while the Commission issues another fatuous communication."
"What signal does this send to the people of Europe?"
"- (NL) One of the many disadvantages of economies of scale is the growing scope for profiteers often to go about their business unhindered for a long time."
"In large, poorly organised organisations, there is a great deal of scope for people who, behind a wall of bureaucracy, want to line their own pockets."
"The European Union is one such large-scale, poorly organised organisation, which offers unexpected opportunities to officials, politicians and companies who earn a living from European contracts."
"In 1998 and 1999, Mr Paul van Buitenen, who was at the time a Commission official, demonstrated potential consequences, with the resignation of the entire European Commission as the eventual result."
"At the moment, Mrs Marta Andreasen, the new whistle-blower, is demonstrating that the financial administration is inadequate when it comes to preventing fraud of any kind."
"Unfortunately, her efforts to make improvements are not appreciated by everyone, and she has been muscled out of her job."
"It appears that there are people who do not stand to gain from improvement."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has established that in 2001, fraud was perpetrated to the tune of EUR 1.25 billion."
"The rapporteur is right to refer to the possibility that has been in place for ten years to exclude from contracts companies that commit fraud, to the fraud-sensitivity of funds and to the desirability of a European public prosecutor."
"Yet, all the proposed measures combined probably have less impact than decentralisation and scaling down."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 10 October 2002."
"Colleagues, it is my sad duty today to mark the deaths of innocent people in two recent attacks."
"We still do not know the exact toll of casualties caused by the car bombs in Kuta Beach, Bali on 12 October."
"Our sympathy and condolences go to the families of all those 200 victims and more than 250 wounded."
"They were victims of a terrible crime which, on behalf of this Parliament, I condemn utterly."
"It is an unacceptable cost to pay for the lesson that stronger cooperation and constant vigilance are needed by all of us in the fight against terrorism."
"The apparently unrelated attack in Vantaa, near Helsinki, that killed other innocents going about their business on the previous day, is also an act I condemn."
"I extend on your behalf our sympathy to the families of the bereaved."
"I ask you now to observe one minute's silence as a token of our respect and sympathy for the innocent victims of these attacks."
"(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"Before we come to the order of business, I am pleased to take the opportunity to report to you something you will have heard about over the last twenty-four hours: the resounding 'yes' vote in the Irish referendum on the Treaty of Nice."
"The vote was carried by a majority in all 42 national constituencies in the country, reversing the previous vote where 40 constituencies had voted 'no'."
"The message I would draw from that for our Parliament today is that the leaders attending the summit meeting in Brussels on Friday should now understand clearly that there should be no new roadblocks on the road to enlargement."
"The time to bring closure to enlargement is at hand."
"October's preparations for the summit meeting in Copenhagen in December now offer the opportunity to bring closure to this historic act of European reconciliation."
"The final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 17 October 2002 pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"Tuesday"
"As 70 individual amendments had been tabled to the report A5-340/02 by Mrs Grossetête on the Community Code for medicinal products for human use, in addition to the 132 amendments contained in the report itself, I had, pursuant to Rule 130a, after consulting its Chairman, asked the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to meet to consider the amendments."
"A number of amendments, however, have been withdrawn in the meantime and a number are similar to those adopted in committee."
"In the light of these changes, it would be more appropriate for me not to refer the report back to committee, but to allow it instead to be voted in plenary."
"Mr President, it is a very wise decision of yours not to require us to have another committee meeting."
"That starts the week on a good note."
"However, you might like to ask somebody - I suspect it will be the inevitable Mr Corbett - to have a look at the Rules, because they are rather strange."
"They state that: 'When over 50 amendments have been tabled to a report, the President may, after consulting its chairman, request the committee responsible to meet to consider the amendments.'"
"That leaves you and me looking through a lot of amendments that can sometimes be rather confusing."
"What we need is either to have a stringent rule simply stating: 'When over 50 amendments have been tabled to a report, the President must request the committee to meet again', or else to drop this."
"As it stands, it leaves it between the two of us."
"I am only happy to say that I support your very wise decision."
"Mr President, I too think it is a wise decision and it shows that it is right that there be flexibility in this rule."
"It is an option open to the President after consulting the chair of the committee responsible, to be used when it will be useful and not to be used when it will not be useful."
"The proceedings today have shown that, even when it is not used, it serves a purpose in putting on pressure for amendments to be withdrawn, thereby saving the rest of us a lot of time later in plenary."
"Pursuant to Rule 111a I have received a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for an extraordinary debate to be held during this part-session on the financing of the nuclear sector in North Korea in the context of the declared nuclear weapon programme."
"The Commission has announced that Commissioner Patten could address this issue on Tuesday at 9 p.m."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of December 2001, we voted on a report on strategy and organisation for energy development in the Korean peninsula, as a result of which we decided to participate in civil nuclear development in Korea."
"Here I would like to mention three points from this report which, given what we have learnt over the past few weeks, are quite interesting."
"One of the recitals of this report read: 'whereas the European Union recognised KEDO as a major industrial project constituting a vital contribution to nuclear non-proliferation and peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and, following negotiations with the founder members, signed an agreement'."
"Nuclear non-proliferation has not been observed, as North Korea has even decided to develop nuclear energy for military purposes, as we have learnt."
"Furthermore, we have once again, in this highly intelligent report against which the Greens voted - we said that it was impossible for Korea to maintain what it claimed to want to maintain. We said on page 9 of this report, in Article 16, that Parliament 'stresses, however, that it will continue to push for an appropriate Inter-Institutional Agreement (IIA) and that it reserves the right to block transfer of funds to KEDO at any point in the future'."
"The last point I would like to highlight is this: '[we stress], in conclusion, that the DPRK will have to show evidence of good faith as the KEDO project progresses, in particular when the final IAEA verification is due', etc."
"Consequently, we must enter into this debate to do what the Americans have done, namely to stop funding the Korean nuclear sector."
"Do we have a speaker against this request?"
"Mr President, does this mean that there is an undertaking to consider once again the possibility of including this item in the November agenda?"
"That is a matter for your group and the other groups to decide at the Conference of Presidents."
"The next item on the agenda is the Commission statement on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"This is important because it is so closely related to the economic and monetary policy of the Union, because it is an incentive for structural change in budget management in many of our economies, because there is an economic slowdown and because it has provoked a debate about how to respond."
"It is important that if we launch a debate on this, that we do so in very calm, rational and strategic terms."
"In recent days there has been considerable controversy on this matter, not least sparked by remarks published in the newspaper le Monde."
"I know that many colleagues in the House were anxious that we should be able to debate this matter briefly today, at the beginning of the week."
"I am pleased that the President of the European Commission is here today to make a statement on behalf of himself and the Commission on the matter and then to open a short exchange of views."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today at a time when we are all in good spirits and full of confidence in Europe's future."
"By approving the Treaty of Nice with a large majority, the Irish people have clearly indicated their support for the ideals and projects of the European Union."
"I wish to express my thanks to the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and to President Cox for their work."
"With this result under our belts, we can embark even more confidently on the final stretch of the road to Copenhagen and final endorsement of enlargement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is with pleasure, with great pleasure that I accepted your invitation to come to Parliament today together with Commissioner Solbes, who will give you an overview of the measures taken by the Commission and the current state of the economy."
"I am very pleased to be here today to discuss with you the coordination of economic policies and the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular."
"What I have to say is simple."
"Economic and Monetary Union needs rules that are clear, effective and, above all, respected."
"To achieve this, we need an authority that can act to protect the common good with due regard for the rules defined in the context of interinstitutional cooperation by adjusting economic policy to changing circumstances."
"The Stability and Growth Pact has been and remains extremely important for Economic and Monetary Union."
"The Commission, as the true, faithful guardian of the Treaties, has carefully monitored its implementation and will continue to do so in the future."
"As the Italian Prime Minister who promoted and approved the Stability and Growth Pact and led the country into the single currency, and now as President of the Commission, I am a committed, firm believer in the value of the rules that underpin Economic and Monetary Union and the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I am a staunch defender of these rules, this Union and this Pact."
"Economic and Monetary Union has brought tremendous benefits both for the countries subscribing to it and for the other European Union Member States."
"Gone are the days of the huge deficits common in the 1990s. Gone are the days when national currencies were exposed to the ups and downs of speculation."
"Along with these benefits, however, Economic and Monetary Union brings specific responsibilities. Responsibilities for everyone - Member States, European institutions and ordinary citizens."
"With a single currency, the euro, each Member State's growth and jobs will depend not only on what is now our common monetary policy but on their own fiscal policies too."
"Stability is the prerequisite for growth and employment in Economic and Monetary Union."
"The Stability and Growth Pact has been the cornerstone for promoting and managing the culture of stability so successfully introduced with the Maastricht criteria."
"Nevertheless, awareness of the extraordinary things the Pact has already brought about and will continue to bring about in the future should not blind us to the limitations of the institutional framework in which we have to apply it."
"Still less does it mean enforcing the Pact inflexibly and dogmatically, regardless of changing circumstances."
"That is what I called - and still call - 'stupid'."
"I do not think that it is the role of the Commission or of myself as President of the Commission to apply rules in that way."
"Neither the Commission nor myself have been appointed to enforce rules blindly, ignoring their limitations."
"The European citizens have a right to be informed, and we have a duty to tell them what we think is right, what we think works, and what, on the other hand, we think could and should be improved."
"Politicians like yourselves, economists, bankers and businessmen, with whom I have discussed this matter a thousand times, have been saying for months and continue to say in private and in their everyday conversations the same things that I said openly and frankly in the interests of our institutions' credibility."
"It is therefore time that we started to say in public what we say amongst ourselves in private."
"The public mistrusts us and our institutions not least because they suspect that that only minor matters are aired in public and that the truly important decisions are taken behind closed doors."
"I am therefore pleased and proud that Parliament should be at the heart of this debate today."
"The Pact is, as it should be, simple, but the situations to which the Pact applies are complex."
"One of the responsibilities of the European institutions is therefore to be aware of the complexity and diversity of the economies of the Member States - applying the same criteria to large and small alike - just as we have the responsibility to keep track of developments here in Europe and in the rest of the world."
"Indeed, we could hardly be unaware of the downturn in the economic cycle in Europe and worldwide."
"This downturn is so marked that a substantial part of the global economy could be in danger of experiencing the kind of deflation that we thought we had put behind us."
"At the same time, we realised that the Pact had not prevented some Member States from adopting fiscal policies incompatible with the objective of stability."
"What were we meant to do in the circumstances?"
"Were we meant to adopt an inflexible approach, trying to force the countries with the biggest deficits to stick to their budgetary targets regardless of the changing economic situation?"
"Should we have made a further mistake, so compounding the mistakes made in the past when countries that had not balanced their budgets missed the chance offered by growth to balance the books?"
"That, ladies and gentlemen, would have been the wrong way to implement the Pact."
"Taking that approach could have jeopardised the economic prospects not just of the countries concerned but of the whole of Europe too, for we are bound together by the single currency."
"If the European institutions had tried to impose objectives that were no longer realistic, they would now be accused of endangering growth and jobs."
"I, however, want Europe to win both battles - stability and growth."
"What a tragedy it would be if, in our endeavours to win the stability battle, we lost the trust and backing of our citizens, the trust and backing that are the foundations of the European democracy you represent."
"(Applause)"
"This is why, last month, we floated ideas for making adjustments and introducing more sophisticated criteria for applying the Pact with a view to making it an increasingly valuable instrument for promoting stability and growth."
"We suggested setting objectives that would restore balance and creating instruments to track progress."
"To bridge the gap at this critical moment, we also suggested giving countries in need of adjustment more breathing space, setting out a more realistic course of action for consolidating deficits."
"We are talking about criteria that will ensure both stability and growth. Indeed, they will allow stability and growth to boost each other."
"We are talking about criteria that apply to all the Member States, both large and small, to the benefit of all the countries of the Union."
"Moreover, ladies and gentlemen, these ideas are completely in line with what we have been saying for a long time."
"Last year, in our communication on strengthening the coordination of economic policies, we proposed a number of major improvements within the present institutional framework."
"As you will doubtless recall, we proposed developing information and economic analysis concerning the eurozone, improving the system of statistics we use, clarifying the principles common to fiscal and structural policies and, lastly, making our decision-making system more efficient."
"Looking specifically at the recent case of Portugal, which was obliged to revise its own statistics substantially, I should like, in particular, to highlight the obvious importance of a proper system of controls on budget-related statistics."
"We shall act in line with this approach when, as required by the conclusions of the Barcelona European Council, we put forward proposals shortly for improving both the transparency and the discipline of the Pact together."
"We shall do so by trying to clarify both the underlying principles of the Pact and the basic principles that should underpin national budgetary policies, thus taking the reality of European economic integration fully into account."
"For instance, we shall show that the need for clear rules can be made compatible with recognition of the fact that the Pact's rules apply to different countries in different situations as regards levels of debt, financial burdens arising from the ageing of the population and the urgent public investment requirements."
"If we apply the Stability and Growth Pact like this, it will truly come into its own as an instrument for coordinating economic policies, above and beyond its purely disciplinary aspects. It will, at last, become an instrument that is fully compatible with the growth and employment strategy adopted by the European Council at Lisbon two years ago, a strategy that Parliament has always supported wholeheartedly."
"New and better rules are not enough, however."
"In order to protect the European Union's common interest, once such rules are approved, we will need the capacity to implement them too."
"If we really want to solve the problems of growth and employment in Europe, we must achieve more intelligent - and more effective - coordination of economic policies, including the necessary structural reforms, coordination which is more easily implemented."
"(Applause)"
"The distribution of responsibilities for coordination of economic policies must be clearly defined."
"Europe's citizens must be sure that the system is in safe hands, hands that are capable of supervising the system and ensuring consistency, both in quiet periods and, even more so, in times of difficulty and crisis."
"As I am sure you will remember, ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, I raised this issue before you and I have come back to it on several occasions since then."
"We need an authority that has the power to supervise the system in a way that is both rigorous and intelligent with due regard for the complexity of our economies, an authority that is capable of intervening in defence of the common good, so that each Member State can adopt the economic-policy measures necessary to prevent its economy from having adverse effects on the economies of the other Member States."
"Only a strong authority can both apply the rules strictly to prevent behaviour that is off-course and adapt the rules to changing circumstances, where necessary."
"I want to make this point even clearer. Budgetary policy is the responsibility of the authorities of the Member States."
"That is true today and it will continue to be so in future."
"For its part, the Commission is an institution whose sole mandate is to work for the common interest of Europe while respecting the full equality of all the Member States."
"By its very nature, the Commission is therefore naturally suited to the role of steering, on the basis of the mandate and the rules established by the Council and subject to Parliament's control, the system that must ensure the coordination of economic policies on a Europe-wide scale."
"There are plenty of examples to support the idea of giving responsibility to an independent, impartial referee such as the Commission."
"Today, I will mention only one, and the case in question is relevant precisely because it is very controversial. It concerns the early warning the Commission proposed to the Council a few months ago."
"As you will all remember, the proposal was not taken up, despite the fact that both the Council and the Member State directly concerned agreed on the substance of the Commission's proposed measure and, in fact, appropriated it."
"In any case, the shortcomings of the decision-making mechanism are still there for all to see."
"That is why the Commission's first formal contribution to the work of the Convention included proposals to prevent such situations from recurring in the future, suggesting that the responsibility of the authority to issue such early warnings should be enshrined in the Treaty."
"The Commission also proposed that the Treaty be amended to incorporate the coordination of economic policies more fully within the framework of interinstitutional cooperation guaranteed by the Community method."
"Lastly, the Commission put forward proposals for addressing in full the need for unitary representation of the euro in international organisations."
"Those, ladies and gentlemen, are the proposals we put forward within the Convention."
"However, there is nothing to stop us adopting some of those proposals as of today."
"Indeed, the changes are of great importance now and they will become even more important with the impending enlargement of the Union."
"We therefore call upon the Council to consider these proposals as a matter of urgency."
"In the meantime, we will continue to uphold the Pact's current rules staunchly, fulfilling our responsibility to propose the improvements we regard as appropriate when and where this proves necessary."
"I am especially grateful to Parliament for giving me the opportunity today to discuss an issue of such vital importance before the representatives of the peoples of Europe."
"European monetary and economic policies cannot and must not be discussed behind closed doors."
"A democratic Europe, the democratic Europe we all want must be a Europe where the policies that affect wealth, employment, growth and development are an essential part of open political debate."
"Within the Convention, the Commission has made every endeavour - and will continue to do so - to point out intelligent ways of establishing a centre of responsibility and authority in the system for the coordination of European economic policy."
"I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to support these efforts."
"(Applause)"
"That is an interesting set of introductions for what I am sure is going to be an interesting debate."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating you, Mr President, on what has happened in Ireland."
"You have had an incredible fight, with the support of many Members of this House, to all of whom I would like to express my gratitude."
"I would also like to thank the Irish members of my group and of Fine Gael, which is in Opposition, and whose sense of responsibility to Europe led them to decide unequivocally in favour of a Yes vote."
"That is a success also for you, Mr President, and I would like to offer you my warm congratulations."
"It is a success for us all!"
"Life brings situations about which it is no pleasure to have to speak."
"Today is one of them."
"Whilst wishing to place on record my personal regard and fondness for Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, as a person, I have to add that we are dealing here, not with relationships between people, but with the acceptance of responsibility."
"That is why an overwhelming majority in my group is of the definite opinion that something has happened that must not be allowed to repeat itself in the same way."
"(Applause)"
"Last Friday, the President of the Commission had this to say to Le Monde:"
"Mr President, Commission President Mr Prodi described the Stability and Growth Pact last week as 'stupid, like all decisions which are rigid'."
"Commissioner Lamy is also on record as having described the pact as 'medieval'."
"Aside from the questionable wisdom of using such strong language, especially to a newspaper from the country which is doing the most damage to what remains of the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, one begins to wonder whether this is part of an orchestrated campaign."
"My question to the Commission President is this: in making your remarks to Le Monde - and you have said that you stand by every word - was it your intention to launch a debate on how to reform the Stability and Growth Pact?"
"If so, that is a debate we welcome, but surely a debate which would better have been conducted some months ago."
"Had the Commission acted more firmly then, using the licence that we gave you when we invested you, its own authority and that of the Stability and Growth Pact might have suffered less damage."
"In the current circumstances, no change is clearly not an option, but two principles must guide us."
"The first is that a well-run economy and a stable currency require taxes and spending to be in balance over the course of the business cycle."
"The second is that the rules are the same for all countries, large or small."
"Those principles are at the heart of the Stability and Growth Pact and my group expects them to be the starting point for any reform."
"If today marks the beginning of a debate on how to improve and strengthen the Pact, what reforms do we need to give it renewed credibility?"
"First of all let us be clear on what we should not do."
"We should not call into question the 3% limit for deficits as we hit hard economic times."
"If countries do not pay off their debts, then we will all pay the price in higher interest rates and a weaker currency."
"The Liberal Group agrees with Mr Prodi that the Stability and Growth Pact must be applied intelligently."
"That is why we supported the Commission's decision to allow two more years for countries to return their budgets to balance, because growth had been slower than expected."
"But we must not forget that postponement to 2006 came with strings attached in the form of a requirement to reduce structural deficits by 0.5% year on year."
"The Liberal Group believes that a new target for the structural deficit should be included in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"That would increase pressure on governments to reduce their deficits in their good times so that they can allow borrowing to take the strain when times are bad."
"On that analysis, any intelligent interpretation would clearly conclude that France's recent budget makes no effort to reduce its structural deficit and is clearly in breach of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"France must therefore face an early warning."
"That is what we would like to hear from the Commission today."
"When the Commission brings forward a proposal for such an early warning, then it will help to restore credibility to the Pact."
"The Liberal Group agrees with you, Mr Prodi, that the Stability and Growth Pact needs authority behind it to apply it."
"That is why we call for the Commission to have the power to issue early warnings against countries which are breaching the rules, whether Finance Ministers agree or not."
"Only if the Pact has a strong policeman can Member States be forced into taking corrective action while they can afford to."
"Let us be clear. We will not support any reforms to the Stability and Growth Pact which undermine the basic principles of fiscal responsibility and equality before the law."
"The end point of reform must be a strengthened Stability and Growth Pact which punishes fiscal largesse and rewards countries which run their budgets responsibly."
"Judging by the warm welcome which Francis Mer, the French finance minister, gave to your remarks in that interview, I fear that France will feel empowered to flout the rules."
"If you wish to have the authority to enforce the Stability and Growth Pact, then you must earn that authority by acting promptly against France and any other countries which might be tempted to follow their example."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, we owe you a big thank you."
"It took courage to say that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid, and you have shown even more courage today in persevering and clearly defending your point of view."
"We now need to go further, and revise this Pact and set a new objective."
"The Pact is stupid when your house is on fire, and you are right, we must stop burying our heads in the sand."
"The financial crisis is even more serious in Europe than it is in the United States."
"We must be prepared for at least two difficult years of restructuring, with the inevitable social consequences that this will entail."
"And we will not be able to overcome this crisis without strong public initiatives, which will require use of the budget."
"The Pact is also stupid when the Union is moving away from the Lisbon objectives, as you mentioned."
"It is stupid when enlargement would require a Pact for the countries joining the Union to bring their economies into line with those of the current Member States, with practical solidarity."
"A Stability and Growth Pact worthy of the name would protect public spending of general interest, put a stop to fiscal competition that scorns ethics and effectiveness, provide the Union with a real budget, and guarantee the Member States' capacity for action, while maintaining a discipline of control over public debt."
"Mr Prodi, you are demanding that the Commission be given real authority over the coordination of economic policies, but we want more than early warnings and the authority to take corrective action."
"What we want most of all is for the Union to adopt an economic policy that addresses the current economic situation and sustainable development, and although the Commission is in effect the only executive body designed to promote common interests, it does not yet have the necessary culture and legitimacy to implement an economic policy"
"That is why we are protesting so that the future constitution of the Union clearly establishes a new legitimacy and political will."
"The Union would no longer be merely a marketplace but would participate in societal choices and concepts relating to the public economy."
"Its mandate would come from the people and the powers of civil society, and parliaments would be set up to draft and monitor decisions."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, it is with joy and great pleasure that I would like to award you the order of merit of the dissident thinkers' club of which I have been the president for some years."
"Finally, thanks to your politically incorrect intervention - as shown by the reactions of some of those on the right - I felt we might actually be able to hold a real debate on the economic, social and environmental governance of Europe."
"Furthermore, Mr Herzog is right to say that the Commission's responsibility for this very economic, social and environmental governance of Europe must be anchored in the Convention."
"Let us stop being so hypocritical!"
"When governments get into debt by taking the wrong decisions, we must tell them they have taken the wrong decisions."
"When France is incapable of reforming its agriculture sector, following the Commission proposals for agricultural reform, we must say so."
"When Europe, or Member States, take the wrong decisions on energy, we must say so."
"There is, however, one thing we must put an end to if we want to avoid a situation where the citizens reject our Europe - which, let it be said in passing, has once again scraped a victory in Ireland - reforms cannot operate solely on the basis of the proposals of banks and employers, without considering those who, either now or in future, have to live with them."
"These reforms must be socially, environmentally and economically equitable throughout society."
"That is exactly what is meant by saying that this Pact is stupid."
"Let us take the example of Germany, Mr Poettering."
"Your great candidate has called for Mr Prodi to resign."
"On behalf of whom or what would Mr Stoiber call for Mr Prodi to resign?"
"Why did you not have the courage to repeat, here, in this House, in front of Mr Prodi, what your candidate said?"
"I would have liked to hear you repeat the same thing."
"We could have laughed about it together."
"Secondly, I would like to know whether a country like Germany, which spent 600 billion in transfers from West to East for the unification, should be treated in the same way as any other country, be it small or large?"
"Should the fact of having carried out these transfers, of paying pensions to people who have never contributed to the pension scheme, be taken into account, yes or no?"
"Let us stop being hypocritical and, finally, let us thank Mr Prodi for having opened the debate."
"Let us continue!"
"The dissident thinkers' club will relaunch this debate in an even less stupid way than Mr Prodi."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, to my great surprise, I read in the paper at the end of last week that the President of the Commission referred to the Stability and Growth Pact as 'stupid' in an interview."
"I hoped that this was a misunderstanding but unfortunately, President Prodi persists in his opinion and is repeating his statement, which is, to say the least, injudicious."
"Clearly, statements of this kind call into question the Commission's policy on the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact.."
"We created this Stability and Growth Pact less than five years ago."
"The Pact's implementation benefits from clear and simple decision-making."
"Unambiguous sanctions are also required."
"Discussions about the Stability and Growth Pact and the possibility to improve the Pact are necessary, but these discussions should not put the Stability and Growth Pact's credibility on the line."
"Exposing a difference of opinion between the parties involved to the outside world spells, in fact, the end of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I should like to hear from Commissioner Solbes how he will be discussing the Stability and Growth Pact's rules in a sensible manner, and in this framework, I should like to find out from the Commission what measures it intends to take in order to present the Member States' budgetary issues in an adequate manner."
"The European economy does not benefit from constant arguing between the parties involved about the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"If it continues in this vein, we are at risk of creating an instability pact, and surely this is not what we want."
"Mr President, one of the following is true."
"Either your statements are the result of collusion with individual Member States, in which case we can expect no transparency from the President of the Commission but rather what could be described as a Machiavellian approach to politics, not one advocated by the University of Bologna - if that is the case, tell us more - or else your actions and endeavours resemble those of a Pope informing us that, actually, the virgin birth is just the Church's little joke."
"If your intention was to launch a debate, as Mr Watson has suggested, then tell us the whole story, tell us, admit that the European economy's real problems are not the result of the Pact and its alleged rigidity but are caused by unresolved structural problems, by the inability to reduce current public spending, which serves merely to nourish bloated administrations, by the inability to reform the welfare state, particularly pension systems, to eliminate the excessive rigidity stifling the labour market and enterprise or to progress along the road of privatisation and liberalisation."
"It is no coincidence that the countries in the greatest difficulties are precisely those which have been most reluctant to adopt ambitious reform programmes in recent years."
"This is what we want you to tell us, President Prodi, in this debate or next time you are interviewed."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, although I very much welcome today's debate, I would like to put it on record that I see the summons to you, Mr President of the Commission, to come to Parliament today, as amounting to a blue letter in response to your latest utterances on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"A glance at history shows us that every currency union lacking the backup of political union failed."
"The EU is not yet a political union, and so the Stability and Growth Pact is what might be termed a stopgap, an imaginary European Finance Minister."
"Demolish it, and you imperil monetary union."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is not stupid, but casting doubt upon it is irresponsible and indeed negligent."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is an effective tool to counteract budgetary folly, a workable substitute for the common EU budgetary policy that, for the foreseeable future, does not exist."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is neither complicated nor rigid; it is flexible and simple enough, with its rule of no new debts in good times and up to 3% of GDP room to manoeuvre in bad ones."
"Most of our States abide by the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Why, I wonder, are the majority in Europe taken to be the stupid ones, just because a few have problems and either have not done their homework or do not want to do it?"
"As they say, people who do not take themselves seriously are not taken seriously by others."
"What are people, the public and the candidate countries to be guided by and be able to hold fast to, if the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, and Member States, declare constitutional principles to be optional and sacrifice them to convenience and to the opportunism entailed in making policy on a day-to-day basis."
"Running up debts may be opportune in the short term, but, in the long term, the debt trap jeopardises growth and employment, stability and social cohesion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to use this minute and this debate to express gratitude and congratulations to the Board of the ECB and its President, Wim Duisenberg for their steady hand and for being an anchor of stability."
"I would, though also like to tell the President of the European Central Bank that, when rain comes pouring in through the roof of a house, or water breaks into a ship, the caretaker or the captain must not go."
"I beg Mr Duisenberg to call off the early retirement he has already announced, and to stay put."
"I want to spare us a debate at the present time as to whether a country that openly defies the Stability and Growth Pact has any sort of moral right to propose a candidate as his successor."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, you said on Radio Europe 1, and repeated today, that you were calling for a central institution to coordinate the eurozone countries' economic policies."
"I do not believe that we need a new institution."
"We have one - the Commission!"
"Your task is to strengthen it rather than weaken it."
"Your task is to implement the Treaty rather than to undermine it, and use enhanced coordination to make the objectives realities."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need more trust and less troublemaking."
"My group is therefore showing the yellow card to all those who cast doubt upon the Stability and Growth Pact."
"If anyone misunderstands that, we will have to show them the red one!"
"Mr President, the application of the Stability and Growth Pact has ended up in a dead end, because it has wrongly focused on current budget deficits rather than on the structural deficits, which are what really matter."
"How long the Commission has taken to admit this!"
"I would like to remind you that this Parliament took the view in 1997 that the Stability and Growth Pact had to be flexibly applied, and there was a majority across the group boundaries in support of this."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is basically suited to being used as an instrument to coordinate European finance policies."
"The Economic and Monetary Union needs a regulatory framework, one that, when flexibly implemented, is able to take market trends into account."
"A rigid interpretation, on the contrary, would let budget deficits increase as a result of the ensuing more pronounced tendency to cyclical weakening and the associated reduction in revenues and increase in expenditure."
"The automatic stabilisers must, though, be applied by all, and comprehensively, when the economy as a whole is going through a slack period."
"Their use should not be tied to good behaviour clauses that cannot be made good, or else the goals of the Lisbon process - competitiveness, full employment and social cohesion - will be out of our reach."
"A balanced budget aims for the mid-point of a cycle, and this objective must always be considered against the background of the conditions of the economic climate."
"That is why neither the Treaty nor the Pact envisage permanent precision or provide for a binding timetable, nor would such a thing be compatible with any interpretation of the Pact that accorded with its purpose."
"What is unsatisfactory about the application of the Pact is the fact that it puts too little emphasis on economic growth, which means that a distinction has to be drawn between deficits that result from current expenditure and those arising from productive capital expenditure."
"This could be done if European financial policy were to be guided by reference to the structural deficit."
"Only then will the Stability and Growth Pact be able to play its part as a positive instrument of coordination."
"That includes, however, efficient coordination of economic policies, with Parliament involved."
"On this also, Mr Prodi and Mr Solbes Mira, I look forward to the Commission coming up with an unambiguous initiative."
"Mr President, we requested this debate because we wished to state that it is time to suspend the Stability and Growth Pact in order to conduct a review of its irrational and incongruous criteria for nominal convergence, which do not take account of the problems and difficulties facing the Member States or their differing levels of development, which are a factor in making their economic problems worse and in hindering growth and the implementation of Community strategies on employment and on combating poverty."
"This became clear at the first round table on social exclusion held by the Presidency and the Commission last week in the Danish city of Aarhus, and in which I took part in my capacity as rapporteur for the European Parliament."
"Now, following the statements made by Commissioner Lamy and the Commission President, Romano Prodi, I can say that we agree with these statements."
"This Pact is indeed stupid, as are all decisions that are rigid."
"This Pact is a clumsy tool for economic governance and must be replaced with something more intelligent, since the 3% rule is positively medieval."
"All of these reasons prove that there is no sense in keeping the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It makes no sense that Commissioner Solbes Mira, on the one hand, confirms that the targets for the stability programmes will not be met in 2002 - and this could not be clearer in Germany, France and Italy - but on the other, where Portugal is concerned, opens an excessive-deficit procedure and applauds the implementation of measures for antisocial policies that create more unemployment and more poverty, precisely in the country that has the worst economic and social situation and the lowest level of development in the entire European Union."
"What is clear is that the Pact's main function is to serve as a pretext, as a political cover-up for the most damaging, disastrous and revanchist government policies seen in Portugal since the revolution of 25 April in 1974."
"I therefore ask: is Commissioner Solbes Mira going to tender his resignation?"
"Or is he going to opt for proposing the suspension of the Pact in order to hold a broad debate on the EU's economic and social guidelines?"
"And is he going to cancel the excessive-deficit procedure that he imposed on Portugal?"
"Or is President Prodi going to do so in order to address the aims of sustainable economic development, of more jobs with rights and of greater social inclusion?"
"I await your replies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with a prefatory remark in order to highlight the climate in which we are engaging in debate."
"The countries belonging to the European Community have at present a mountain of debt totalling EUR 4 700 billion."
"What that means is that, taken together, the countries belonging to the European Community owe EUR 4 700 billion."
"The annual interest payments alone, by which this debt is serviced, amount to EUR 230 billion per annum - more than double the European Union's Budget."
"I am sure that you, Mr President of the Commission, will agree with me when I say that it would be stupid and idiotic to open these floodgates even wider at the present time."
"I will now turn to the Stability and Growth Pact, for which we have framed rules that are very clear."
"With the objective of balancing budgets, the deficit may not exceed 3%, and sanctions become operative if this 3% rule is not adhered to."
"That is the point at issue, and that is what we have to deal with now."
"It was an enormous help to your country's budget, at the time you were at the head of its government, that these rules create confidence."
"This confidence led to lower interest rates, and that took a great deal of pressure off your budget."
"My second point is that I believe it really would be stupid to gamble away these advantages now."
"Mr President of the Commission, you said that there is a need in Europe for an authority that would have an undisputed role of economic governance."
"You may not have used those words, but what you meant is a European economic government."
"That is a view that I share."
"In my view, that can only be the Commission."
"What is required of such an economic government, though, is that it should lay down rules and see to it that they are adhered to, in order that they may send out the right messages."
"Mr President of the Commission, by your interview with Le Monde, you sent the wrong message."
"What we expect of you today is that you should make good that error and should do as Parliament demanded on 2 May 1997 and apply the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact - not flexibly, but strictly and consistently."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Stability and Growth Pact was adopted in 1997 as an extension to the excessive deficit procedure, the Maastricht Treaty having famously required that Member States had to remain below the excessive deficit limit in order to join the single currency."
"Consequently, in spirit - not in letter but in spirit - the Stability and Growth Pact can be no better or worse than the Maastricht requirement in question."
"Many people perhaps consider that the introduction and success of the euro are ex-post vindication of the inflation and excessive deficit limits, those all too restrictive limits."
"They are wrong!"
"The strict limits imposed in Maastricht certainly succeeded in keeping prices under control, but they exacerbated unemployment in the European economy."
"Unemployment and recession have not strengthened the value of the euro, they have undermined it, witness the fact that the euro fell by nearly 20% against the dollar when it was introduced, at a time when budgetary deficits were under better control than they are now, while now that deficits are supposedly getting out of control, the euro is almost on a one-to-one parity with the dollar."
"Witness also the fact that every time the European Central Bank has raised interest rates, that is, every time it has tightened monetary policy, the value of the euro has fallen rather than risen, contrary to the expectations of those who decided to raise interest rates."
"The money markets will supposedly punish Europe for its governments' lack of budgetary discipline by depressing the value of the euro."
"Wrong!"
"The money markets know full well how important economic activity is to the value of a currency and appear to have no intention of punishing a reasonable relaxation in this restrictive policy - reasonable of course in that no one is talking about excesses or irresponsibility - at a time when we are on the brink of another major recession."
"I think that this analysis justifies President Prodi's choice of words and analysis."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, if the implementation of a policy to limit the new debts entered into by states adds up in practice to inflation-cutting measures combined with a simultaneous increase in economic growth, then there is nothing to be said against it."
"Here lies the crux of the situation we are in today."
"The best option for generating growth is to encourage demand by means of investments by governments, investments by enterprises and by private consumption."
"If, despite the European internal market, nation states continue to assume that they must gain for themselves advantageous positions within the European Union - and that is possible in the absence of an adequate harmonisation of economic, fiscal and social policy - then, quite simply, the fundamental conditions for sustainable growth in Europe are not there."
"Increased domestic demand will not be achieved by reducing wages, which diminishes purchasing power, or by increasing the tax burden on small businesses, which create more jobs and apprenticeships than anyone else, and it will not be brought about by taking so much of the tax burden off big businesses that they no longer pay anything at all."
"Cutting investment rates during a slowdown, even though there is no inflation of any significance, has a procyclic effect and makes no economic sense."
"There are marked differences between the budgets of the Member States."
"The fact that shadow budgets are the order of the day means that there is, even within the European Union, no comparable basis for the calculation and management of budgets."
"If this leads us to talk in terms of altering the Stability and Growth Pact, this must not be done because of the present complex economic situation, for that would be political opportunism; instead, discussion must be a consequence of the construct being fundamentally dysfunctional."
"Any reform of the Stability and Growth Pact must go hand in hand with greater coordination of European policies on the economy, social affairs, employment, tax and the environment, if there is to be any real upturn in investment."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, I should like to describe your statement in Le Monde as economically understandable and fair, but politically not very astute."
"We only have to look at today's debate to know what I mean."
"It appears to be a debate between the people who create the impression that they want to do away with the Stability and Growth Pact altogether, on the one hand, and, on the other, those who have apparently accorded the present Stability and Growth Pact the status of holy writ."
"This should not be what the discussion is about."
"What should it be about?"
"In my view, it should be about striking the right balance between the need, recognised also by my own group, to reach a structural credit balance in the medium term and the equally important need to take into account the economic reality and cyclical movements."
"Is this now a licence, as some fellow MEPs call it, for every country to do as they like?"
"No, indeed not."
"It is, however, an incentive to further refine the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact by, for example, drawing a distinction between necessary investments, infrastructure and by showing concern on the one hand, and - we might as well give all the details - irresponsible election promises, on the other."
"It is right in my view that countries experiencing an economic downturn, such as Germany for example, are given more time to get their budgetary position on track."
"However, in my view, countries that are intent on a structural deterioration of their deficit by, for example, making out bad cheques, like France, should, in my view, be given a yellow card in future, with good reason."
"Mr Prodi, if it was your intention to stir up a discussion about a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, then you can count on my support."
"I admire your courage when you say that you do not want to remain deaf and blind to the changing economy."
"If that is the case, I can forgive you for your bad timing."
"I can assure you: intelligent agitators invariably do well in the end."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, our citizens deserve a strong euro."
"The euro can never become a dominant currency in the world, the sort we have set out to create, unless the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact are strictly adhered to."
"I do not really understand why you are now saying that the Stability and Growth Pact is stupid."
"Before the articles in the Pact were signed and sealed you were an economist, a qualified economist, and you were influential in the debate on economic policy."
"Why did you not say these conditions were stupid before the Treaty of Amsterdam?"
"We agreed this Pact for situations just like these: to make the work of politicians easier when there is a recession and it is difficult to balance public sector finances."
"This is no surprise."
"Economic boom periods do not last forever."
"It is certainly no surprise for any Minister of Finance, and it cannot be a surprise for the Commission."
"Booms are followed by recession."
"It is quite obvious that it is more difficult to achieve the aims of the Stability and Growth Pact in a slump than it is during a period of economic prosperity."
"These four Member States which are now in difficulties and which have promised their citizens something they cannot do are paying the price of not doing what they should have done when we had an economic boom."
"Many Members of Parliament would be prepared to increase the Commission's responsibility and extend its role in coordinating economic policy."
"Unfortunately, however, remarks like these and the fact that they are being made by Members of the Commission at all, none of whose business this is in any way, do not in the least increase our faith in the notion that we should be giving the Commission a greater role in the coordination of economic policy in the Convention on the future of Europe."
"When Commissioner Lamy, for example, condemned the Pact as being medieval he was evidently representing more the French Socialist Party rather than the Commission's view on trade policy."
"You really should withdraw remarks like these, and I am furthermore asking you to give more thought to what you say."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse President Prodi's frank, well-balanced report and Commissioner Solbes' recommendations."
"The need, which I fully endorse, for flexible application of the Stability and Growth Pact and for coordination of economic, social and environmental policies, starting with the eurozone, has, however, been completely disregarded during the recent years of recession, not least because of the serious forecasting errors made by the European Commission and the European Central Bank, which actually discouraged any attempts to promote or coordinate an active, counter-cyclical economic policy shared by the Union's governments."
"Moreover, it is true that the flexible, selective management of the Stability and Growth Pact cannot be left to the discretion of the individual governments, for this could result in the weakening of social cohesion and, at worst, higher inflation."
"I therefore support the proposal to include the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, in other words the programming of public investment in the areas of research, lifelong training and environmental improvement and the creation of integrated European transport and telecommunications networks, as an additional objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, subtracting the sum of these investments from the total budgetary deficit of Member States' governments."
"This decision requires, of necessity, strong support from the European Community."
"Indeed, the Community must be able, through the Commission, to assess, ex ante, the compatibility and conformance of the investments with the objective of making the European Union the most competitive and dynamic economy based on knowledge, full employment and sustainable development in the world by 2010, facilitating the coordination of these investments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has a single currency but it does not have a common economic policy."
"It has a single currency but it does not have a genuine economic policy authority."
"It has a single currency but it does not have a genuine federal budget."
"Until yesterday, the Union had the Stability and Growth Pact: the wonderful substitute - yes, a substitute - for a non-existent economic policy, for a non-existent proper redistributive budget, for a non-existent economic policy authority, while even the single currency and the monetary area are far from perfect."
"As you know, President Prodi, the credibility of the euro is linked, amongst other things - above all, I would say - to the Stability and Growth Pact and to its capacity to force the Member States to produce responsible budgetary policies: budgetary policies, I would point out, which they themselves have proposed and which are accepted by all their citizens."
"Of course the Stability and Growth Pact is subject to constraints - that is clear and we are all aware of it - particularly at a time of recession such as that the Union is currently experiencing."
"Nevertheless, Mr Prodi, it is one thing to find an intelligent way round these constraints, but it is quite another to actually remove them, to change the rules half way through the game, leaving a free-for-all."
"What concerns me, President Prodi, are not the intelligent changes - which are always welcome - but the danger that budgetary policy will actually be renationalised."
"This, President Prodi, is the most serious matter, the most perilous danger of all, for we could end up endorsing the policies of the irresponsible countries and penalising countries which have implemented responsible policies, the countries which have placed their trust in us."
"Rewarding the grasshoppers and punishing the ants will not help the euro: it will do nothing to further European integration at this very sensitive point in its development."
"This is why the European People's Party will, through its members taking part in the Convention, acting in accordance with the mandate they received at the recent Estoril Congress, propose that the Convention should constitutionalise the basic principles of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I am sure you will agree with me."
"And please, beware of fair-weather friends who arrive by your side at the eleventh hour!"
"Mr President, I welcome, understand and support the recent statements by President Prodi on public finance policy in Europe."
"If I understood correctly, the Commission has now made an intelligent start to a process of defending the Stability and Growth Pact, which will only be possible if it demonstrates political courage and if it is able to break with some of its current positions."
"We hope that the European Parliament, which is, by definition, the Community institution that is most open and most representative of the common citizen, understands and supports the positive process that President Prodi has set in motion."
"Only those who have been going around with their heads completely in the clouds and divorced from Europe's economic reality could be surprised today."
"It was clear from the earliest days that the Stability and Growth Pact was founded on rules that would work reasonably in times of economic growth but which could prove to be a hindrance when faced with certain unforeseen circumstances and with only moderate growth."
"The Europe of the Euro is founded on a framework of a single monetary policy and twelve separate budget policies."
"This justifies the existence of clear rules preventing undisciplined economies, especially the larger ones, from jeopardising the stability of the system."
"Budgetary rigour is the guarantee that today's generation will not bequeath excessive debt to future generations."
"Forcing States to rationalise their spending and to make their services more efficient is crucial to a genuine development strategy."
"I am sure that we all agree on this."
"Nevertheless, the disciplinary rules must be understood by the markets and must not contravene national policies and the legitimate interests and commitments associated with them."
"This requires them to be worded flexibly, and adapted whenever this should prove necessary."
"This is the original sin of the Stability and Growth Pact and this is why more and more voices are calling for it to be amended."
"Closing our eyes to this new reality would be to reject out of hand all of our commitments, condemning the Pact and especially its aims, to total failure."
"A static interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact is beginning to look unsustainable, because it does not respond to the current economic situation and even less matches the aims that the European Union set for itself in Lisbon of becoming, in the short term, the most powerful economy in the world."
"Using the Stability and Growth Pact intelligently, emphasising the pillar of growth in the current economic situation is absolutely crucial for nature not to rebel and for the building that has been constructed so laboriously not to collapse."
"Mr President, economies differ - that is just a fact."
"The Stability and Growth Pact has to have a far more sophisticated interpretation."
"The background for this has to be sound public finances and a stable economy."
"Furthermore, as you have stated, it needs to take into account the economic cycle for budgetary policy."
"Also, further reforms have to be sustainable, measured against the country's debt profile."
"We must also allow for public investment, because that can lead to the growth that you referred to in the Lisbon Summit and not just deal with welfare."
"Countries like the United Kingdom for example after all those disastrous years of under-investment under Tory governments, need to catch up and we must be able to let them do that."
"But the fact is that, as the old joke says, 'if you line up all the economists around the world head to toe, you may never reach a conclusion'."
"What we do not want is to line up the Commission head to toe and find out that all that is left is inconsistency."
"Let us change the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Let us make it flexible - you can help do that - but let us recognise that it has to be a sophisticated instrument in a real economy."
"Mr President, the Stability and Growth Pact was introduced to safeguard the euro as a strong currency, but, in view of Europe's generally poor economic position and high rate of unemployment, it should be permissible to rethink or refine the stability criteria for the precise reason that this will keep the euro strong."
"A currency is as strong as its economy."
"If the economy is limping along, the currency will be weakened in the long term."
"The high level of tax in Europe weakens the economy and is not leaving private citizens enough room to manoeuvre or enough disposable income to boost consumer spending."
"Also, too much money is being poured into the grossly distended bureaucracy of the civil service."
"This must be changed."
"The euro needs not only a pact for stability, but also, primarily, for growth."
"Discussion of this issue is therefore both necessary and sensible, in order that the euro may in the long term become a strong rather than a weak currency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this debate, which has not been purely academic, as it could have been, given its chance, idiosyncratic origins; it has been a weighty debate on the economy which I hope can be repeated in the future."
"The different positions - do not worry, Mr Poettering, I never mix personal relations with political opinions - which have emerged in this debate have revealed something important, namely that the system we are working with is unbalanced."
"There is an ex post coercive instrument to ensure that the necessary rigour is respected - although, thanks to the lack of authority, a genuine obligation is not always imposed: it is often an invitation rather than an obligation - but there is no ex ante instrument to create the conditions for balanced development, to help the countries which are bound together in the single currency to achieve balanced development in terms of healthy public finances and employment."
"As a result, we will be in danger of breaking the code of Community living - and that really would be stupid - if we do not employ the political astuteness which we need to foresee disagreements and tension and to avoid a situation where we have to stand by, powerless, until the time comes to clamp down, with the risk, as we have heard, that the Member States will indulge in bargaining."
"This is the direction the Commission wishes to take, so let us get started, as Commissioner Solbes said, and continue to exploit all the possibilities provided by the existing instruments, but we must ensure that European economic policy is no longer dictated purely by accounting instruments."
"A number of specific references have been made to the European Central Bank, but the European Central Bank is doing its job properly, you know."
"The problem is that we cannot leave it without support!"
"We have a European economic policy in which, thank God, there is a Central Bank which has been successful from the start, and for this we must give it its due because it really did start from scratch."
"It has been a Herculean task to create a control and monitoring structure, an economic financial analysis structure, from scratch, with 12 different countries, and we must safeguard the independence of the Central Bank but not its isolation."
"We are here today holding a debate, and the debate has revealed that the issue of an economic policy authority has not been resolved."
"Mr President, I would like a further debate to be held on this matter."
"Indeed, we share a single currency, and this means that we cannot devalue, it means that we cannot vary interest rates, it means that we really are tied to a system which is strong and rigid in many respects."
"Well then, if we want this system to work, we must establish an authoritative institution to help us coordinate economic policy headings."
"I am not pushing for the Commission to get the job here - I am putting us all forward as candidates."
"I have never said that this authority should necessarily be the Commission, of course not!"
"This authority needs to be created, to be established, to be formed because we have to protect the single currency together, and we therefore have to move together towards the future."
"I can assure you that, in my interview - which, I would stress - was a long one - the word which has been the subject of so much criticism referred not to the Stability and Growth Pact, as has been reported, but to the fact that the Pact has been interpreted too literally."
"Reference has been made, for example by Mr Abitbol, just now, to Saint Paul: the problem is the difference between the spirit and the letter."
"We are enclosed, shut away in a corner, and we have to work according to the letter of the law, and it is the letter which is stupid."
"We have to have instruments, we have to use politics, we have to use the spirit of the law if we are to interpret our people's problems."
"Remember that, when there are discrepancies between different countries' economic policies, things could come to a head at any moment. In this sense, Mr Watson, it was not by chance that I brought the subject up."
"I gave the interview on purpose, although you are right - I could have discussed it with Parliament, and I will do so whenever you call upon me to discuss these matters, for they are the basis of our Community life."
"I broached the subject because of the work of the Convention. We need to debate these issues so that the Convention realises that we are experienced, that we are capable of addressing these issues."
"Another reason why I raised the matter is that the European people are calling upon us to discuss economic affairs not just in terms of finance and balancing accounts but in terms of things that affect their everyday lives, and I can assure you that this does not mean I have been lax or too flexible in economic matters."
"In the past, I have even had the courage to impose a Europe tax on my country - specifically labelled a Europe tax - because I feel that the citizens have to be given clear, accurate information."
"Clearly, we in this House have to discuss the issue of the spirit and the letter of the Pact, with due regard for the Pact and within the constraints of the current situation where we have to apply it to both large and small countries."
"This is another of the problems which have emerged during this debate: do you apply equal rigour in the event of deviation on the part of France, Germany or Italy, whose deficits are approaching or have already exceeded 3%?"
"I can assure you that, if this information is confirmed by official notifications or Commission statistics, as agreed in the Amsterdam declaration, the Commission will apply the measures laid down in the Treaty and the Pact, it will discharge its duty towards all because that is its job."
"I have said, however - and I reiterate it before the House - that this is not enough!"
"It is not enough to ascertain the existence of the deficit, closing the stable door after the horse has bolted!"
"Here, we have to develop a common economic policy - we owe it to our citizens!"
"That is why the word I used may have appeared rather strong."
"My apologies to the academics, but I believe that this has served to show all of us what we must do in the future."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, during the night of 26 to 27 September, the ship de Joola sank off the coast of Senegal, taking with it many Senegalese, a group of Europeans, and Roel and Lisette Arendshorst from Groningen."
"President Wade of Senegal has taken responsibility for this disaster."
"Since his own country has no money for the recovery of the ship, President Wade has already talked about a burial at sea."
"This is unacceptable."
"For the relatives of the victims, it is of the utmost importance for the bodies of their loved ones to be recovered as soon as possible, since problems of identification will arise as time goes on."
"As an inquiry has shown that the ship is stuck on a sandbank, it would be relatively easy to recover the bodies with the aid of sub-aqua divers."
"This kind of recovery is not terribly costly but may still be too expensive for Senegal."
"Last week, I already made an urgent appeal to Commissioners Nielson, Patten and Bolkestein to release European funding from the European Development Fund."
"Time is pressing."
"I still have no reply."
"I should once again like to urge the Commission to offer financial support to Senegal as soon as possible so that the parents and siblings of Roel and Lisette, and the relatives of the other victims, no longer have to live with the anxiety and can bid farewell to their loved ones in a dignified manner."
"If I understand correctly, Mrs González Álvarez, it may be that some questions need to be put to the Commission too, so that we can get to the bottom of the matter."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that it is you who are in the Chair, for this afternoon I received a telephone call from a young woman."
"She was the winner of the Miss Denmark contest."
"She has decided - very courageously, I think - not to go to Nigeria to take part in the Miss World contest."
"Today, she has, however, received a letter from the Miss World organisation, encouraging her to take part in the light of the fact that one of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament - and it was in actual fact yourself, Mr Imbeni - had encouraged the candidates to take part and so abstain from a boycott."
"This young woman we are talking about is naturally rather confused, which is understandable of course."
"I therefore want to ask you to confirm today, or to confirm to myself as soon as possible, that the European Parliament has not come out in favour of the candidates' participating in the Miss World contest and to confirm that we have not therefore encouraged them to participate."
"I should also like to ask you to confirm that the closest the European Parliament has been to discussing whether these women should boycott the Miss World contest has been the discussion we had in the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities when women were specifically called upon to boycott the Miss World contest."
"I hope that I can obtain confirmation now and, if not now, then in writing in the very near future."
"Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, without using up too much of my fellow Members' time, I can confirm that, firstly, my opinion is different from yours; secondly, I expressed this opinion at a press conference; thirdly, I did not speak on behalf of the European Parliament, of course; and fourthly, I sent an e-mail to the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, stating that, in my opinion, the decision made by the Committee on Women's Rights to call for boycotting of the initiative was wrong, for a number of reasons which I am not going to go into here for fear of opening a debate which is not on today's agenda."
"Later, if you wish, tomorrow or the day after, I can explain to you why I feel that the line taken by the Committee on Women's Rights was inappropriate."
"Now, however, in my capacity as President of the sitting, I cannot speak on the matter."
"The next item is the report (A5-0332/2002) by Mr Andrew Nicholas Duff, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the impact of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and its future status [2002/2139(INI)]."
"rapporteur."
"Mr President, the future status of the Charter was one of the four key questions bequeathed to us by the now famous Treaty of Nice for consideration at the IGC of 2004 and since Laeken, it is a central question confronting the Convention."
"This resolution, should it be passed, will represent a formal contribution to the Convention from the parliamentary delegation."
"We have looked at the impact so far made by the Charter as a solemnly proclaimed instrument and we have found that much use is made of it by the Ombudsman, by Parliament, by the Commission and even sometimes by the Council."
"We have found also some uncertainty among the citizens about the Charter's scope as a solemnly proclaimed instrument."
"For the courts, the Charter is already an important source of reference alongside the ECHR and the constitutional traditions of the Member States."
"Yet the national constitutional tradition referred to is already broad and, in a Union of 25 plus Member States, it will become improbably vague."
"Therefore, we conclude that we must incorporate the Charter firmly within the Treaties, so that what is at present an important source of reference will become a central source."
"Commission Vitorino and his working group in the Convention are considering the technical and semantic niceties that will be involved in incorporation and I look forward to hearing from him how successful the efforts of his working group are proving."
"This parliamentary resolution refreshes the political story of the Charter."
"It says why incorporation in the treaties is important and why it should become mandatory upon the Union and upon the Member States, when and, in so far as, they put into effect European law and policy."
"It also says why the Charter will become an important building block of the further development of the concept of European citizenship."
"As we enlarge, the Charter succeeds in spelling out for all concerned why fundamental rights are so salient to bringing Europe closer to the citizen."
"It proposes that we establish for ourselves our fundamental rights regime at the centre of the integration process so that it will stand as a jewel in the crown of our future constitution."
"I commend the report to Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to congratulate Mr Duff, not only in his capacity as rapporteur for this report but also in his capacity as a member of the Convention drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The report we are discussing today is based on the previous positions held by Parliament, adopted when the Charter was drawn up, in the course of 2000, and these recommendations fully respond to the aim of making this Charter the basis for a constitution."
"I am speaking in my capacity as Commissioner but, of course, I cannot ignore the fact that, at the same time, I represent the Commission in the Convention on the Future of Europe and in that capacity, I chair the 'Charter' working group."
"Without going into details, I think I can tell the House that the members of the working group for the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty have expressed broad consensus on the answers to give to the technical issues with which we are wrestling and which concern the modalities and consequences of the Charter's potential incorporation into a future constitutional Treaty as well as the modalities and consequences of the European Union's potential accession to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I believe that there is an enormous degree of unity between the recommendations contained in Mr Duff's Report and the conclusions of the working group."
"To be specific, I would first emphasise my agreement with the fact that the Charter today is a reality that has truly taken root in European life, being used by citizens, by the Advocates-General, in judgments of the Court of First Instance, and by national courts, even at the highest level; the constitutional courts of the Member States."
"Mr Duff's Report also makes the observation that incorporating the Charter will not attribute new competences to the Union."
"The Charter is already clear on this matter but could be more explicit in the horizontal clauses providing for the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaty, especially in order to allay the fears that some people have expressed."
"The Charter is not in itself a source of competences or a legal basis that will enable the Union to pass legislative measures."
"It is a source of reference for the values that must be present in all EU policies."
"By the same token, the Charter does not in any way limit the competences of the Member States."
"It does not replace the system of Member States in the field of human rights, and is not designed to replace the role of national constitutions."
"I therefore share the rapporteur's opinion emphasising that the Charter must now be given binding legal force and a constitutional status, in accordance with modalities to be decided and which will depend on the future structure of the Treaties"
"It appears that two alternative solutions are being drawn up for this matter."
"Firstly, one which in fact deserves the support of the majority of the members of the Working Group, the incorporation of the entire Charter, in the form of a title or first chapter in the Constitutional Treaty."
"Alternatively, the inclusion in the work of the Constitutional Treaty of an article referring to the Charter containing the entire text of the Charter, dealt with in a specific section of the Constitutional Treaty or in a protocol."
"It is also quite legitimate at the current juncture not to attempt to amend the provisions of the Charter before they are validated in the Constitutional Treaty."
"The Charter represents the political commitment of the previous Convention, which this Convention must respect."
"This does not mean, however, that some technical adaptations should not be made, especially with regard to the so-called 'general' or 'horizontal' clauses."
"The 'Charter' Working Group has been working on this matter and the aim is to come up with adaptations that do not affect the substance of the provisions and are instead designed merely to clarify the meaning of the current horizontal rules."
"The European Parliament and the Commission have always looked favourably on acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The rapporteur reiterates this point of view, which I welcome."
"The members of the 'Charter' Working Group take the view that the Union's accession to the European Convention is fully compatible with enshrining a charter with constitutional value and binding legal force."
"In this regard I believe that the result achieved by this working group will also receive a very broad consensus."
"If the Union does indeed accede to the Treaty, it will become subject to external control, which is entirely in line with that exercised by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg over the Constitutional or Supreme Courts of the Member States."
"In this sense there is no subordinate relationship between Courts and nor is the independence of the European Community's legal system affected."
"This issue is closely linked to that of the future legal personality of the Union."
"The task of the Convention is indeed going to focus on incorporating a constitutional provision into the Constitutional Treaty to enable the Union to negotiate accession in practical terms with the Council of Europe and to decide, in accordance with normal procedure, when accession should take place and under what conditions, without in any way undermining the individual commitments of each Member State to the European Convention on Human Rights and its additional protocols."
"I sincerely hope that incorporating the Charter into the Constitutional Treaty and the Union's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights will constitute two fundamental milestones in the process of giving the European Union a constitution that acknowledges the values and principles of fundamental rights."
"Mr President, one of the main tasks of the Convention on the future of Europe is to respond to the question raised in Laeken almost a year ago about how appropriate it would be to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty on European Union."
"A working group within the Convention was set up for this very purpose, competently chaired by Commissioner Vitorino and which is ready to make its conclusions public."
"Today, the European Parliament, through the report by Mr Duff, seeks loudly to reaffirm the position it has always maintained."
"I should like publicly to express my agreement with his conclusions and to take the opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur on the extremely broad consensus that he was able to add to his achievements in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"We are in no doubt as to the need to make the citizens and their rights the focus of our shared existence."
"What we have is not so much a market but a collection of women and men who give this Community meaning."
"This is why we wholeheartedly call for the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated as the major part of the future Constitutional Treaty of the European Union."
"We are aware, of course, that many of the rights, principles and freedoms could have been worded differently and will have to be revised in future."
"No human work is perfect."
"From our point of view, however, that time has not yet come."
"It is time today to clarify and strengthen the legal status of the Charter, giving it a binding nature and increasing the legal protection of European citizens from the European institutions and from the Member States when they apply Community law."
"We therefore support the strategy advocated in this report and its main conclusions: to make it the major part of the new Constitutional Treaty, to lay down formal rules for its revision and, following the explicit attribution of a single legal personality to the European Union, to advocate accession to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Essentially, the debate we are having today might appear to be merely technical: what status will the Charter have in the constitution that will come out of the Convention?"
"This debate poses a question that is absolutely essential from a political standpoint: what are we to do about the debate on citizenship within this Convention?"
"Fortunately, our Charter does not simply address citizenship, but also represents, for our fellow citizens, an essential reference point, and from the beginning of this process, we have said that the Convention must aim for a more democratic, more comprehensible, more transparent Europe."
"What our fellow citizens are asking is to be able to feel that they are European citizens."
"It seems to me that the tool currently available to us to make citizenship come alive is the Charter."
"So let us incorporate it."
"Parliament has already requested this many times, and will do so again in voting for Mr Duff's Report."
"I believe this is a prerequisite for the work of the Convention to be accepted."
"The question is knowing how to incorporate it."
"My concern, personally, is that this incorporation would confer first-rung status on the Charter in the hierarchy of European texts."
"This basically means that when one sector or another needs to lay down provisions in its field, it must respect the spirit and the letter of the Charter."
"The question of a revision therefore arises, and we know that this is a debate that has caused much concern, including when the work of the previous Convention was concluded."
"Like most of us here, I believe that the current Convention does not have the authority to re-open this text, and I also believe that this would be politically inappropriate."
"The main thing is to check how this revision could take place, because there is no reason to imagine that these texts are written in stone."
"We ourselves, in drawing up this Charter, took a few liberties with the text of the European Convention on Human Rights, due to the need to adapt and modernise it."
"Let us imagine that our successors might also need to adapt the text: this would have to take place in the same conditions in which we ourselves wrote this text."
"Basically, the Charter could only be revised according to the most restrictive rules proposed by the Convention."
"My group and I have tabled an amendment to this end and I hope that Parliament will be able to adopt it when voting on Mr Duff's Report."
"I shall end with two brief comments."
"First, I am anxious to know whether the debate - which is theoretically technical - on the so-called 'horizontal' clauses runs the risk of limiting the scope of the Charter."
"This should be our common approach: no reduction of the Charter's scope."
"Lastly, of course, I would like to express my support of the European Union's signing up to the European Convention on Human Rights, on my own behalf and on behalf of my group."
"In this way we will have a complete set of measures to protect the rights of our citizens and our residents."
"Mr President, I should firstly like to thank the tireless rapporteur for his work on the Charter."
"It is important that there should be no end of lively discussions of the Charter and of the position it is to occupy in relation to the work of the Convention."
"I should also like to thank Commissioner Vitorino, not just for his principled support for further work on the Charter but also for pointing out that it would not be at all easy to incorporate the whole Charter into the future constitution or wherever else it is to be incorporated, the constitution's being the most likely candidate."
"What I think is important when we discuss these issues as politicians is that we constantly live in the tension between the vision and the reality. The vision is clear enough."
"I must go back and say a little about the content, but we would all want the whole of the Charter to be incorporated."
"The Charter is important."
"It embraces important human and other rights that it is important to secure for the citizens of Europe."
"On the other hand, we also need to decide our attitude to the facts, or current political reality, and ask ourselves how much of the Charter we could pilot through now that there are 15 countries in the EU, with the hope of there in actual fact being 25 once we have embarked upon the Intergovernmental Conference."
"It is this tension that we always need to be clear about."
"I support the Charter."
"I have always thought it was a good Charter."
"I have also worked on it in relation to the Danish constitution and must say that it is rather better and more forward-looking than, for example, that particular constitution read only as it stands and without the whole historical background."
"I do not believe that all the existing constitutions are ideal but I also think, on the other hand, that the Charter is at present becoming something of a 'sacred cow'."
"I therefore think it good to be able to look at whether some articles are more important and more significant than others and at whether there are matters it might not be thought crucial to incorporate at this stage."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for his openness and for making it clear that the issue is really not so straightforward as all that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the report deals with one of the most important problems that the European Constitutional Convention has to solve, namely how to integrate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future European constitutional treaty and guarantee loophole-free protection of fundamental rights in the European Union."
"Parliament has for a long time already been the motive force behind this issue in the EU."
"This report, addressed directly to the Convention, finds Parliament again doing justice to its political role."
"I would therefore like to say how very grateful I am to the rapporteur, and, for that very reason, address three issues that are also reflected in my amendments."
"For many people, the primary and justified expectation is that the Convention will decide in favour of the incorporation of the Charter into the constitutional treaty, and so it must be ensured that it contains not merely guiding principles for the institutions of the European Union; these must give rise to binding rights, which are to be safeguarded by the European Union and, which, if need be, can form the basis of any citizen's appeal to the courts."
"The report - in its item 1, for example - is quite right to frame this as a demand."
"I take the view, though, that Parliament is frustrating its own objectives when it is stated, under item 2 of the report, that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be incorporated into European constitutional law only in the form of a preamble."
"A preamble could perhaps serve as some sort of pretence of a future constitutional treaty, but, in legal terms, it is not a norm relevant in law."
"I believe that such a stance on Parliament's part would be understood by nobody at all."
"Secondly, we are right to demand that the EU should accede to the ECHR."
"It is already becoming evident that a majority in the Convention favours this position."
"If Parliament wants to continue to be the motive power behind this, then, I believe, it must also call the associated problems by their proper names."
"I consider Recital Z to be inadequate in merely pointing out that the ECJ stands in the same relation to the ECHR as does any national constitutional court."
"To say that is to draw a veil over a problem, as the fifteen Member States take very different approaches to the issue of relations between the national constitutional courts and the Court of Justice in Strasbourg."
"In my judgment, the constitutional treaty must give its own answer to the question contained in the report."
"I will make my third point to the rapporteur later on."
"Mr President, it is in the nature of fundamental rights that they are not conferred but merely acknowledged, and that fundamental rights are perforce derived from human dignity."
"The Council's refusal to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights binding in law therefore puts us in an absurd situation, in which, on the one hand, fundamental rights are regarded as an inevitable consequence of the recognition of human dignity, whilst, on the other hand, people are denied the chance to exercise their rights."
"I thank the rapporteur for again making it clear that it is Parliament's top priority to incorporate fundamental rights into the European constitution, and indeed that they are a foundation stone without which a constitution is utterly unthinkable."
"I concur, though, with the comments made by the lady who spoke before me, in that it is not the preamble that I envisage being used for this purpose, but Article 1 of the constitution, but I do not imagine that there are any serious differences between us on this point."
"I am, secondly, grateful to the rapporteur for his observation that we must not allow the chapter on the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be reopened and renegotiated in the Constitutional Convention, which has no mandate to amend the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"If we were to again call the Charter into question, it would damage the credibility of the first Convention as a whole and thus also shatter the method of the Convention as such."
"Yet there is, to my mind, a certain contradiction - and hence my question to Commissioner Vitorino, who has picked up this point - in the announcement that amendments are to be made to the horizontal provisions, which form an essential part of the stipulations on the scope and effect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is perfectly conceivable - and some discussions lead me to suspect it - that an attempt is being made to use the horizontal provisions to limit the Charter's scope."
"Any such attempt must meet with resistance from us."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mr Duff for his excellent report and also Commissioner Vitorino for his expert comments."
"Anyone who had the honour of being actively involved in the Convention that drafted the Charter will realise that the broad consensus was not self-evident at the time."
"It is the result of very thorough, exhaustive and intense efforts."
"For that reason, we must prevent the text of the Charter from being re-submitted for discussion."
"Sterling work was done at the time."
"Tabling sections of the Charter for discussion will only weaken this excellent piece of work."
"My advice therefore would be to leave the Charter as it is, except for technical changes."
"This is the first point I wanted to make."
"My second point concerns the combination of the Charter with the ECHR, which has spawned more difficulties than necessary."
"This is evident from a number of articles written by judges and experts from the two courts of justice in Luxembourg and Strasbourg and is also clear from the work of Mr Vitorino's Convention working party."
"It turns out to be highly feasible to synchronise the work of both courts with regard to the ECHR and with regard to the Charter."
"This is also the view taken by our PPE-DE Group here and by the PPE-DE Group in the Council of Europe."
"We are therefore of the opinion that the path has been cleared for the Charter's inclusion in the new constitutional Treaty."
"It is our desire to do this and we will therefore commit ourselves to this in the Convention."
"This brings me to my third and final point, namely the Charter's importance for EU citizens."
"It is crucial for the rights of our citizens to be firmly anchored in the new constitutional Treaty that is being drafted."
"We know all too well that citizens' rights , minorities' rights, and social rights are still very fragile, particularly in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"It is all the more important that these rights are enshrined in the new treaties and, above all, in the constitutional section of the Treaty."
"These rights should, in my view, be enforceable."
"In that way, citizens in Western and Central Europe can count on the same constitutional rights - rights enshrined in a European constitution, guaranteed by the Union and, if necessary, enforceable by European courts."
"This seems to me to be the thrust of the Duff Report, which is why we will be endorsing it."
"Mr President, the Charter is a milestone on the road that leads to real EU citizenship, and it also sets down in writing that it is people, rather than the market or power, who should be at the heart of European politics, and so I join with all those who have said that these rights must not exist only on paper."
"They must also become binding."
"Congratulations to the Commissioner and the rapporteur on their intention that the Charter should form part of the constitutional treaty."
"I agree that it should not be mentioned only in the Preamble, but that the Charter should form the first chapter of the constitution."
"We are always saying that this constitution should be able to be read in schools."
"This Charter is wonderfully readable; it would make a fine preface for a European constitution, and its reflection of Europe's values leads me to believe that it should actually be printed in its entirety."
"My second train of thought leads me to the view that the Charter should be incorporated without any changes being made to it."
"It was the subject of really lengthy discussion in the first Convention, and I cannot see any reason to amend it again."
"At most, there might be a need for editorial adjustments to the transversal articles, but not substantial alterations."
"They contain everything on the Charter's scope, and do not need to be duplicated and made more complicated."
"Our rapporteur is to be thanked for his excellent report, which will without doubt become an important document for the Convention."
"Mr President, the subject of the report is ostensibly the effect of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"One looks in vain to the report, however, for a serious discussion of this legally and politically quite crucial issue."
"I shall content myself with making two points."
"First of all, why do we need an EU Charter at all when we have the European Convention on Human Rights, endorsed by all the EU Member States?"
"The answer is, because the EU as such has not endorsed the Convention."
"By making a simple treaty change, the EU should, however, endorse the treaty as a matter of course, and that is something also recommended in the report."
"When that happens, however, there will be an inevitable clash between the Court of Human Rights and the EC Court of Justice."
"The report's talk of smooth cooperation is sheer nonsense, legally speaking."
"Secondly, the crucial part of the Charter's agenda is about promoting the EU's permanent expansion."
"The Charter is purely and simply a building block for an EU federal state."
"Both citizenship and a constitution are part and parcel of a federal state."
"As is apparent from, for example, paragraphs 7, P, X and N, the citizens of the European Union are being subjected to the EU's federal authorities. This all constitutes destructive and outrageous interference in matters of national law, and the fact that a veil is being disgracefully drawn over this is reason enough for voting against the report."
"Mr President, a Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights are the two faces of the new Europe that we are building because democracy cannot be organised with twenty-five countries without binding fundamental rights."
"Firstly, because the credibility of enlargement and confidence in it must be founded on a common stock of principles and rights which consolidate relations between States and citizens, whom history has deprived of the ability to live together and to trust one another."
"Secondly, because the new citizenship of the Union, which places European citizens at the heart of European legitimacy, requires their defence and protection against any abusive behaviour that could result from the centralisation of power in the name of efficient decision-making."
"We must therefore find a basis for giving the citizens direct access to the Union's courts and we must similarly define the mechanisms that will persuade national courts to apply the Charter in the name of the citizens."
"The status of the Charter must, therefore, be raised to that of primary law, making it a fundamental source of reference for the Court of Justice and for national courts, thereby making this instrument basic Union law and a genuine integral part of the Community's legal acquis."
"What kind of area of freedom, security and justice would we be building without a Charter of Fundamental Rights?"
"What kind of model for civic and political co-existence could exist without this?"
"Mr President, no new competence is being created as a result of the Charter."
"On the contrary, it limits the exercise of power of the future Union."
"Furthermore, no right is being removed from those already enjoyed by the citizens of the Member States, and nor is any higher protection being diluted into a Charter that lays down only minimum rules."
"Consequently, if we wish to have an organised democracy, based on common values, let us make the Charter form the basis of a Constitution, making it the fundamental source of reference and protection for the Union's citizens."
"This is what the report states, this is the opinion of Mr Duff and this I believe, in fact I am sure, is the opinion of Commissioner Vitorino."
"I heartily congratulate both of them!"
"Mr President, you will not be surprised that, as a British Conservative, I am going to sound a slightly discordant note in these otherwise harmonious proceedings."
"I agree that it is right that all the institutions of the EU should observe the same standard norms, but I am still less convinced that such legal constraints need to be included in the Convention."
"I also feel that they should not be enforceable by the EU on Member States beyond the present commitment represented by their signatures on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"They should not apply to private companies, individuals or organisations, nor should they cover matters of social affairs, employment or cultural policy."
"We are being presented with a vehicle filled with good intentions."
"However, I fear we are also opening up a nightmare of duality in the appeal, on the one hand, the European Court of Human Rights and, on the other, the European Court of Justice."
"We have cases changing from one to the other, profiting only the lawyers."
"I am sorry for those of my colleagues who are distinguished lawyers, I do not wish them any diminution in their profits, but this is not something we should encourage."
"Recital V shows that this is already happening."
"The prospect of conflicting authorities being announced in the two courts is bureaucratically intolerable and a judicial nightmare."
"Paragraph 2 also concerns me."
"The Charter must bind the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the Committee of the Regions, but should it be a 'central reference point for the European Court of Justice and national courts'?"
"No, it should not be a central reference point of national courts."
"This is another indication of the potential for confusion."
"This confusion must be sorted out before this report is adopted."
"I urge Parliament to reject this report and allow the committee to resolve it."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that, for many countries, the easiest solution would be to incorporate the Charter with reference to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union."
"That would presumably be the easiest solution for my own country too."
"All the same, I do think, however, that we must think longer and harder, for if the idea is that people should identify with the treaty, they must be able to consult the treaty or constitution and see outright what rights they have in relation to the EU."
"I therefore think that the maximum solution should be chosen whereby the EU is endowed with legal personality and accedes to the Convention of Human Rights, for this solution would give the Court of Human Rights more authority in relation to the EC Court of Justice."
"If we opt for the maximum solution, however, we must at the same time be open to the anxieties that might legitimately be felt by certain Member States, especially when it comes to issues of national identity."
"I should perhaps have liked to have seen the rapporteur insert just one simple clause to the effect that we must bear this concern in mind, for if we in actual fact listen to the legitimate concern the Member States may have and, at the same time, opt for the maximum solution, I think we shall succeed in combining the broad vision with the facts."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to thank all those who have spoken, and especially those who agreed with the report."
"I also strongly congratulate Commissioner Vitorino for successfully brokering an agreement in his working group on the technical and semantic problems which have confronted some representatives of Member States."
"On the question of the preamble, I quite agree and I will accept Amendment 7."
"To my Eurosceptic friends, I say that this is not some subversive plot."
"The Charter carries great authority and legitimacy. What it lacks is clarity and legal certainty."
"It is precisely to ensure that we can improve the position as regards certainty and clarity that we are seeking its incorporation."
"We are not being shamefully silent, as Mr Crowley said, on the impact on national law."
"The charter primarily concerns the competences of the European Union and the powers of the Union authorities."
"Finally, can I say that Lord Stockton and I find ourselves in appropriate political parties in Great Britain."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Statement in writing (Rule 120)"
"Mr President, Mrs Lambert, ladies and gentlemen, the Lambert Report that we are today debating deals with a crucial proposal for a directive frequently referred to as the Directive on Qualifying for International Protection."
"I believe that this directive constitutes the core of the common European asylum system, the need for which was underlined in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the conclusions of the Tampere, Laeken and Seville Councils."
"The Commission agrees with the European Parliament that the harmonisation at European level of policies in the field of refugees is absolutely crucial."
"This is not, in fact, merely an issue of harmonisation: it is a matter of responding to problems facing the Member States in the field of asylum that can only be addressed appropriately at EU level."
"This applies perhaps particularly to the criteria for receiving international protection."
"The various national systems currently contain different criteria for citizens being able to receive protection and an at times highly disparate set of laws on refugee status or on subsidiary protection."
"These differences between the various national systems cause secondary movements, which is undesirable as far as all EU Member States are concerned."
"In order to create a situation of equal treatment, the proposal for a directive on qualification for international protection contains standards for a common definition both of refugees and of those who are entitled to subsidiary protection."
"It also contains standards for rights to be granted to these two categories of people."
"It guarantees a minimum level of protection in all Member States for anyone in genuine need of international protection, and at the same time prevents abuses in requests for asylum, which damage the credibility of the system."
"The proposal starts from the premise that international protection must only be granted by Member States if there is no effective national protection in place against persecution, regardless of the source of this persecution."
"Lastly, we must emphasise that the subsidiary protection proposed in the directive must be considered to complement the system of protection enshrined in the Geneva Convention on refugees and must be implemented in such a way so as not to damage but to complement the current refugee protection system."
"The Danish Presidency's idea, supported by the Commission, is that rapid political agreement should be reached on this proposal, together with the regulation determining the Member State responsible for studying asylum requests, known as Dublin II, and the amended proposal for a directive on asylum procedures, specifically at the end of November at the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"It is therefore extremely important for the Commission that Parliament adopts its position on the directive as rapidly as possible so that the Council can debate this issue in light of your opinion."
"Mr President, as we have just heard the proposed directive is effectively the linchpin of the common asylum policy, setting out the basis for minimum standards for people qualifying as refugees under the Geneva Convention and subsequent protocols, and also the criteria for people entitled to international protection under other international conventions and human rights legislation."
"I personally regret the decision to apply this directive only to third-country nationals and stateless persons, thus removing the EU Member States from its scope, and I shall be voting for the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group to that effect."
"However, the basis of the Commission's perspective is the need for protection and our responsibility to provide it."
"The majority of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs supported the Commission in upholding the 1951 Geneva Convention, which does not differentiate between different actors of persecution, and welcomed the move away from the narrow view held by some governments and parties that only state persecution creates official refugees."
"Full application of the Convention would take account of, for example, those suffering at the hands of the FARC, a non-state agent of persecution in Colombia, and would also cover political opposition in Zimbabwe and countless other instances."
"We disagreed with the Commission, however, on the point of protection being afforded by a state-like agency, such as the UNHCR, and felt that this effectively imposed the duties of a state on a body that could not be held legally accountable."
"The majority of the committee chose to support amendments by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, which strengthen the position of women as a social group liable to persecution in some countries, and have included the example of genital mutilation in line with a previous Parliament decision on the issue."
"We also took the view that sex and sexual orientation should be taken into account when looking at the definition of a social group."
"This has been emphasised by the Union under the Copenhagen criteria and the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We are well aware of recent cases of persecution in, for example, Egypt and Jamaica."
"The majority of the committee does not support the view that this directive should deal only with refugee status and that subsidiary protection could be dealt with at a later stage."
"We agreed with the Commission and the UNHCR that it was appropriate to deal with the two categories together and not just for administrative reasons."
"The complementary systems consider first of all whether a person needs protection."
"If they do, then their status needs to be defined."
"Even a full application of the Geneva Convention does not meet all protection needs and that is why many Member States have additional categories."
"It is not true to say, as some do, that those in the additional category necessarily stay for shorter periods or face less serious problems in their country of origin."
"If we are to have a common asylum policy, we have also to deal with these additional needs and it makes sense to deal with them together."
"We need a holistic approach that meets our international obligations and the needs of those we aim to protect."
"Because we see the two groups as complementary, the committee majority chose to accord similar social rights to the two groups."
"It must be sensible to allow those who wish to work, train or acquire an education to do so."
"It benefits the individuals, our society and their country of origin on return and, by meeting basic social needs, we can avoid larger social costs."
"The EU's own social inclusion strategy recognises the links, for example, between poor housing, poor health and poor educational attainment."
"If this applies to our own nationals, it seems only reasonable for those entitled to international protection to benefit from an equivalent entitlement if we are to avoid creating social exclusion, contrary to our own EU policy."
"Our committee also agreed by a majority to a definition of family that aims to maintain the principle of family unity and to embrace a wide definition of family."
"That is a familiar argument in this House."
"It seemed sensible to accord similar status to all family members, if only to avoid the bizarre situations which sometimes occur when one family member can be accorded refugee status and another, on the same information, is denied it."
"We also agreed to uphold the effective right of conscientious objection on the grounds of religion or belief - a right internationally acknowledged."
"In conclusion, I should like to thank all my colleagues for their serious work and commitment on this report, whether we agreed or not."
"The committee has made positive amendments to the Commission's already sound proposals and I trust this position will be maintained in the vote tomorrow and supported by the Council."
"A positive position there will be a strong assertion of Treaty obligations and the humanitarian response of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission draft and the accompanying Parliamentary report, which we are debating today, can be described, without qualms, as the European institutions' admission of bankruptcy as regards asylum policy."
"Mr Vitorino, it is you who bear primary responsibility for the fact that, in the course of three years, your House has failed to produce even one single proposal on the right of asylum on which we might come to a compromise."
"What is even worse is that your House does not yet, for any practical purposes, separate the three pillars of economic migration, asylum rights and subsidiary protection."
"That is why your proposals regularly end up in the Council's waste paper basket."
"The left-wingers in this House, though, also bear their due share of responsibility for the failures to date."
"Even the Commission is going beyond the harmonisation of minimum standards, yet, as a matter of principle, the left-wingers keep on making the proposals broader."
"There is nothing, though, to equal the mendacity involved in you delivering great speeches in this House on asylum policy and allowing yourself to be lauded as the defender of refugees' rights, while your own left-wing governments, in Great Britain and Germany for example, boast about their strict policies on asylum."
"Even Mr Cohn-Bendit argued on French television last week in favour of tighter regulation."
"Why?"
"Because, at home, you are subject to quite another kind of public scrutiny, and there you have a responsibility to our citizens, whose capacity for assimilating refugees has limits - limits that you consistently disregard here."
"Tomorrow, then, we will be putting our amendments to a vote by roll call in order to expose your hypocrisy to the public gaze."
"Let me turn now to the report. There is nothing new about your proposal to expand the definition of 'refugee' far beyond what is contained in the Geneva Convention."
"Hitherto, this has always been rejected by us, by the Council, and even by the minister in Germany's red/green government."
"If you have your way, people receiving subsidiary protection will be treated in almost the same way as recognised asylum seekers."
"That, though, is quite nonsensical."
"In Germany, we have known refugees from civil wars not to apply for asylum, because, as a rule, they want to return to their country once the civil war there has ended."
"Integration in the host country is not for them, nor do they want it in the least."
"Anyone who demands compulsory schooling for the children of these refugees must need his state of mind examined."
"Most of these children speak not a word of the host country's language, and you want to have their status reviewed only after five years instead of after one!"
"I can imagine no situation in which the conditions giving entitlement to subsidiary protection are present five years running."
"No, different groups need different arrangements, and so the Council is right to call for two different approaches."
"Why does this directive again concern itself with the reunification of families?"
"After the first flop that you and the Commission produced here, I wonder if you, Commissioner, are working on a new holistic approach?"
"So what is it to be - an integrated approach or rules in every single proposal?"
"I do not doubt that the Council will chuck this proposal in the dustbin as well."
"You, though, will in future prefer to talk about open coordination, and will thereby conceal the fact that a European asylum system has been a failure, a failure you yourself provoked."
"Your proposals have a damaging effect on European integration."
"We reject them and support the amendments tabled by our - and your - chairman, Mr Hernández Mollar."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is surprising, considering what is happening today in Belgium, to hear so much criticism of the Commission proposal. Indeed, in my view, it is a great credit to the European Union and this House."
"We must bear in mind that, in the year 2000, 389 000 people made asylum applications, spread throughout the 15 Member States."
"Perhaps we should show a degree of humanity and realise that, behind all the speeches that we make in this Chamber, there are men, women and children who are fleeing persecution and conflicts or who are seeking to escape from a life of poverty and deprivation."
"Have we already forgotten that it is as a result of what we have experienced here in Europe in times of war that we have built up what now constitutes and justifies our presence in this House?"
"In our States in crisis, since the events of 11 September, those seeking asylum and international protection have been perceived by many as a threat to law and order, to social stability and even, in some cases, to national security."
"It is our duty, because we have a duty to remember, because it is the very justification for our existence, because we are essentially a democratic body which defends human rights, to give everyone a chance and to stop the European Union becoming a 'Fortress Europe' which is closed to the rest of the world."
"Following on from other reports already adopted by Parliament, I believe that the proposal before us today makes it possible to establish something that is a real credit to us, in other words an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Furthermore, in order to introduce some coherence between the regulations and laws of the Member States and to define a platform for common standards, we are establishing, through this proposal for a directive, minimum standards on the definition and scope of the status of refugee."
"Let this be clear: the minimum standards are not aligned with the lowest common denominator, they do not make it possible to do a U-turn and to seal up Europe, the very place where the Geneva Convention was conceived - it is necessary to point this out again?"
"The main victims of violence, trafficking and mutilation are women and girls."
"It is necessary, in particular, to ensure that they benefit from assistance, protection and services, and, at the same time, to make these women, who are at the greatest risk from discrimination in their countries of origin, less easy prey for traffickers of human beings or pimps, who deceive them with the offer of trips or visits to our countries."
"That is why this proposal for a directive, which seeks, furthermore, to protect these women and children, must enable them to exercise their rights, must enable them to make an asylum application, must enable them to expose the specific forms of persecution that they have endured, because these are, first and foremost, attacks on respect for fundamental rights."
"It is this, discussions on directives such as this, which justify our continued presence in this Chamber."
"Mr President, three years ago, the Tampere European Council gave the initial impetus to a common European asylum and immigration policy."
"The objective was to have common rules adopted that would make the EU into an area of freedom, security and justice."
"That was the point of departure."
"Three years after the Tampere meeting, we must now take a practical stand on an important step towards fulfilling that vision."
"Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are satisfied that our attitudes have been taken into account in the work of the committee."
"In our view, it is a coherent and well-balanced report that has been presented for debate here in the Chamber."
"It is important that we obtain common minimum standards for refugees."
"If the rules are to be effective, it is also important for all the Member States to have a common definition of what a refugee is."
"I am pleased that the report contains general rules for determining whether or not international protection is properly justified."
"Today, a number of the Member States have problems related to asylum and immigration policy."
"Each year, a large number of illegitimate asylum seekers enter the EU."
"They are a burden on the whole system and a drain upon those resources that could be used for the benefit of those who have real needs."
"Illegal immigration and people smuggling must be combated, but genuine refugees must be helped."
"It is this balance for which we must strive and which, in my opinion, the report makes possible."
"An important prerequisite of its being possible to put this proposal into practice is that we obtain a common definition of refugees with subsidiary protection status."
"It must be based upon relevant international conventions such as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and the UN Convention Against Torture."
"I support making the concept of subsidiary protection status a part of the common refugee policy."
"Asylum policy is one thing, however, and integration something else."
"It is important for third country nationals to be given the opportunity of making headway with their lives in their new countries."
"That is something which quite a few EU countries know already."
"For example, Denmark and Sweden have set to work on active integration policies."
"The proposal has elements relating to common rights for third country nationals with legal residence in the EU, and these rights must form the basis of a sensible and necessary integration policy."
"Overall, the report takes a balanced view of the problems with which we are confronted, and I hope that it will be able to attract a broad majority in Parliament."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying how necessary it is to lay the foundations for a policy shared by all the Member States on immigration strategies, on combating illegal immigration and therefore on a common definition of the right to asylum too."
"In particular, as regards the right to asylum, many Member States complain that the amount of applications they receive is excessive, condemning the attempts of some asylum applicants to abuse asylum procedures in order to get round Member States' immigration laws."
"Indeed, it is essential to make a clear distinction between immigration, illegal immigration, the trafficking and exploitation of human beings and the right to asylum, the latter being a right which must retain its valuable, specific status as a human right which must be safeguarded."
"From this point of view, the report, pursuing what is supposed to be an open, progressive line of reasoning, widens the definition of the right to asylum - a fundamental right which, as such, cannot have too wide a definition - excessively and inappropriately, first and foremost because those requesting protection and those requesting the status of refugee are, in practice, placed on the same level, and secondly, because the report proposes too wide a definition of the right to asylum granted subsequently to family members too."
"Indeed, family members eligible for international protection include same-sex partners and partners' children, and likewise, when it comes to minors, members of a minor's family other than the minor's actual parents can be considered to be their parents, and they therefore do not necessarily have to have lived together with the applicant in their country of origin."
"Therefore, unless amendments are adopted which make substantial changes to the text, particularly with a view to reducing the scope of the definition of 'family member' in the context of the right of family reunification, my group will vote against the motion."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the Commission and Commissioner Vitorino on their sound proposal."
"I have one point of criticism."
"The Commission proposes an asylum system that includes a refugee status and a subsidiary protection status."
"It thus creates the possibility of treating persons with refugee or subsidiary protection status differently."
"Given the importance of equal treatment of persons in the EU Member States, it would have been preferable if the Commission had not drawn this distinction."
"Fortunately, the directive in question concerns minimum harmonisation and Member States may go further when they transpose the directive into national legislation."
"They are free to give persons with a subsidiary protection status equal treatment."
"The Lambert Report is keen to extend the Commission's proposal."
"Although meant well, the proposed amendments will, in my view, in fact, hamper the proper implementation of the directive on account of their subjective content."
"Accordingly, an asylum seeker must be given the benefit of the doubt when he makes conflicting statements as a result of traumatic experiences."
"In evaluating whether fear of persecution is real, consideration must be given to the gender, sexual identity, sexual orientation and health of the refugee and the habits and customs in a country."
"The Member States should retain a certain level of policy freedom."
"In addition, a workable system requires that the officials who carry out the policy should have a certain level of discretion."
"The proposals tabled by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs unnecessarily restrict this discretion."
"They will at best lead to more bureaucracy and less freedom in the assessment of individual cases."
"I will therefore not be endorsing these proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I share the view that the directive to be drafted here is a fundamental one, and it is our common opinion that asylum law is in urgent need of harmonisation."
"Between the rapporteur's approach and that of the European People's Party, however, there are fundamental differences."
"What are these differences?"
"You propose a common approach to dealing with subsidiary protection and the protection accorded to refugees."
"We are opposed to that; we want separate directives."
"You propose extension of protection far beyond the bounds set by the Geneva Convention."
"We want the Geneva Convention retained."
"You want to take family reunification much further than consensus in this House has previously allowed."
"We want the nuclear family."
"You want to grant subsidiary protection, for five years and with a residence permit, immediately."
"That does not make sense, so we want protection to be given for as long as it is reasonably needed."
"So it is that the measures you are presenting here do not ensure that help is speedily given to real refugees under the Geneva Convention, but rather incite the use of asylum for immigration by economic migrants, and that tends towards its misuse."
"What we find lacking in the Lambert Report, though, are primarily calls for quick procedures enabling us to decide in the minimum of time who is a refugee and who has a chance of asylum."
"At present, that amounts in any case to some 90% of applicants for asylum."
"Your report contains no reference to an EU-wide list of safe third states and states of origin."
"It contains nothing about applicants being required to go back if they are not given permission to remain, nor does it contain measures to ensure that they do so."
"Nor does it contain any demand for the European Union to conclude agreements with third countries, countries of origin and transit countries, to take applicants back."
"Finally, it contains no firm demand that Dublin II be used to prevent asylum shopping."
"In so many respects does this report contradict our thinking that I have to say that the European People's Party is unable to support it unless the relevant changes are made."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's draft directive is meant to provide a minimum level of protection in the Member States for such third-country nationals as are actually in need of protection."
"This implies, though, that secondary migration, in other words, the misuse of asylum to which Mr Vitorino referred, will thereby be kept under control."
"So, Mrs Lambert, the prime requirement when it comes to dealing with economic migrants is support for impoverished countries, in order to prevent human resources from haemorrhaging away through emigration and to promote economic growth with a better quality of life for the people."
"The subject of asylum is seen as sensitive in all the Member States, as is shown by the fact that it has been impossible, to date, to get any of the previous draft directives on this subject adopted by the Council."
"I therefore regard the rapporteur's approach, which involves extending the already very far-reaching Commission proposal still further, as being quite utterly wrong."
"It may soothe our own conscience to grant asylum also on economic grounds, but it does not help this Parliament to be taken seriously in our Member States."
"The proposals for extending the scope of asylum to citizens of the European Union show how some MEPs regard ideologies as more important than sensible solutions."
"Solutions, though, are what the citizens of our countries have every right to expect."
"We and the people in our Member States are of one mind in believing that those who are persecuted must be given humanitarian aid."
"This does not mean, however, that the granting of asylum can solve all this world's social, economic or environmental problems."
"On the contrary, that leads to the great benefit of the right to asylum being nullified."
"We, the representatives of the people, have the task of finding pragmatic solutions, on the one hand for the European Union, and on the other for the asylum-seekers."
"A forward-looking asylum policy in the EU must also take into account the circumstances and needs of the people in our Member States."
"The report before us does nothing of the sort, and so the PPE-DE Group rejects it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's plenary has been studying various proposals to establish a common European asylum system, thereby pursuing the aim of gradually developing a genuine area of freedom, security and justice, which must be open to persons who, in various circumstances, legitimately seek protection in our Community."
"Recently, at the Estoril meeting, the PPE-DE Group attached importance to these matters by holding their own seminar on this issue, the conclusions of which were reproduced a short while ago by Mr Pirker."
"We agree with a common asylum policy that contains minimum rules designed to ensure a minimum level of protection for persons in genuine need of it."
"We also agree with the aim of restricting the secondary movements of asylum seekers by reducing the differences that exist between the legislation and practices of the various Member States in this field, as well as imposing a fair division of efforts between the States."
"We also agree that refugees, like any persons benefiting from other forms of protection, should be able to live with dignity in the Community of which they are a part, which can only happen if we protect their personal and social rights."
"In these matters, however, it is better to move slowly and appropriately rather than rapidly and get things wrong."
"Policies that appear to be very generous end up creating feelings of rejection and increasing xenophobic reactions that we can only condemn."
"Even following 11 September, we have seen, amongst the public, suspect attitudes and increasing hostility towards asylum seekers, refugees and immigrant communities."
"From this point of view, we must acknowledge that the Lambert Report has not helped to generate the consensus that would be useful and desirable in these matters."
"Without wishing to dramatise, Mr President, this proposal contains a core of minimum standards that reveal the legislative courage to respond effectively to the issue of citizens of third countries in need of international protection, at the same time eliminating national differences in the way in which persons are treated, avoiding the need for secondary movements."
"This, at least, is our view."
"I therefore wish to highlight an extremely positive aspect of the Commission proposal, which is the complementarity of the dual status of international protection in which, in addition to the narrow approaches of the 1950s, the concept is extended to subsidiary protection, clarifying the concept of the perpetrators of persecution not limited solely to the State and its agents but also to material circumstances and others in which the outcome is that the State does not give protection, either because it cannot or because it does not want to, and we can all recall such situations in Africa and in Latin America."
"We also have the concept's inclusion of the protection organisations of stable quasi-State authorities, which must be held responsible in practical terms for the protection of individuals who fall outside the scope of simple peace or military security missions, which often relegate into second place the effective protection of individuals and respect for human rights."
"Lastly, extending refugees' rights in terms of periods of residence, employment and integration mechanisms, which concern every aspect of refugees' citizenship."
"The violence arising from poverty and from other social scourges is not included but I hope that this will be covered in future by means of a broader concept of common asylum policy."
"For the moment, however, a good part of the ground has been covered, as have the bases for a common European asylum policy."
"The Commission should, in our opinion, be congratulated on its work, but the Council must not continue to defraud us, demonstrating its congenital inability to take a decision, as is traditional and as usually happens in these matters."
"Nor, Commissioner, will the Council be receiving from this House, from this Parliament, an endorsement for its inefficiency, ineffectiveness and for failing to vote."
"Mr President, I should like to respond to a few of the points that have been raised in the debate this evening."
"The first point concerns Mr von Boetticher's contribution, the first of the right-wing Christian Democrat hit-and-run contributors."
"He hits out at the left in the Parliament, he hits out at the governments in the United Kingdom and Germany, and then he runs out of the Chamber so that he cannot hear the debate."
"He runs away from the debate and he runs away from the reality."
"The reality is that there are millions of people in the world who are seeking sanctuary in the European Union."
"It is a situation that needs a sympathetic response."
"It needs Member States to look at the situation and to try to address the position with compassionate moves."
"This is why my group on this side of the Chamber makes no apologies for supporting a common European asylum policy, believing that it is the only way forward for the European Union."
"I say to those Members opposite who say they are going to vote against these measures tomorrow and who, like Mr Coelho and Mrs Klamt, have said nice things about a common European asylum policy: you cannot say nice things about it on one occasion and then, every time there is a vote, vote it down."
"Mr Pirker has spelled out the objections but it is not being consistent when one Member of your group, Mr Helmer, is writing that they should end the automatic rights or end the Geneva Convention and end the automatic right of entry for those deemed to be suffering from persecution."
"We need to be absolutely clear where they are coming from."
"On this side we are quite clear in our approach."
"We will support this report."
"We very much believe that there need to be minimum standards."
"There need to be proper standards for asylum seekers, to recognise that they are invariably desperate people seeking desperate measures to escape from the appalling situations in their own countries."
"We should be compassionate in the role that we seek to play."
"We should be compassionate in our reports."
"That is why I am very happy to commend the rapporteur on this and to congratulate the Commissioner for bringing it forward."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for this debate, which has raised some extremely important questions, to which I should like to respond."
"Firstly, the Commission unequivocally defends the primacy of the implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention, which is binding on all Member States."
"We have also covered rules on subsidiary protection and, on this matter, I should like to put Mr Berthu's mind at ease: we have created nothing new; this is not the invention of a Commissioner's Machiavellian mind."
"Subsidiary protection is already in place in our fifteen Member States."
"It arises from international commitments given by these countries, for example, when they signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically the criteria laid down in its Article 3."
"With regard to the scope of this directive, I should like to say that the Commission does not accept the proposals for amendments tabled by some Members, seeking to add new grounds or to add an exhaustive list of exclusion clauses for the definition of a refugee under the Geneva Convention."
"We cannot accept these because the European Union does not have the authority to amend the content of the Geneva Convention."
"It can only be amended with the agreement of the 150 States that are parties to it."
"This process has been opened by the United Nations High Commissioner but we are not in a position unilaterally to amend the Convention."
"Similarly, we believe that the proposals on procedural guarantees, as generous as they are, should not be included in this directive."
"The issue of procedures should be dealt with in the proposal on that subject, on which the Commission has tabled an amended proposal."
"By the same token, I wish to say to Mr Pirker that this is not the proper place in which to deal with issues of return, the Dublin II Regulation, or cooperation with third countries."
"These issues are important, I agree with you - and the Commission will be working on them, as indicated at the Seville Council."
"Last week, therefore, the Commission tabled four new proposals for negotiating readmission agreements with Turkey, Algeria, Albania and the People's Republic of China."
"Over a year ago, the Commission presented a regulation on which State should be held responsible for studying asylum requests, known as the 'Dublin II Regulation', which, I hope, will be concluded by the end of this year and the Commission will, in November, present its action plan for returns policy, as well as a framework for financial action for cooperation with third countries in the fight against illegal immigration."
"With regard to the issue of equal rights amongst refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection, the Commission believes that the rights pertaining to the beneficiaries of these two different types of protection must be the same."
"We feel, however, that there should be a 'cooling-off' period and, therefore, we proposed that there should be a distinction, precisely in order to acknowledge the primacy of the implementation of the Geneva Convention."
"Finally, why did we include subsidiary protection in this proposal?"
"Let us be quite clear about this."
"Today, in all Member States of the European Union, the majority of persons receiving international protection do not receive this protection under the Geneva Convention but under systems of subsidiary protection."
"And if we wish to combat secondary movements, if we wish to combat 'asylum shopping' it would be of little value merely to include only the Geneva Convention."
"The essence of 'asylum shopping', the essence of secondary movements lies in the competitiveness of subsidiary protection systems, to which we can add - please forgive me for saying so, ladies and gentlemen - that it is unfair to accuse the Commission of extending the concept of economic refugees by means of subsidiary protection."
"On the contrary, only by dealing with the harmonisation of subsidiary protection will it be possible to adopt the so-called single procedure, which has been welcomed, as a matter of fact, by an increasing number of Member States, in which requests for asylum are studied in order of priority in a single administrative process and are subject to a single final decision."
"This is known as 'streamlining procedures'."
"This is a way of rationalising procedures that saves time, administrative means and money without having to provide unnecessary resources."
"Finally, Mr President, Mr von Boetticher claimed that I bear a major responsibility for this matter and in doing so paid me a compliment which I really do not deserve."
"It is not the Commission proposals that are blocking the Council's decision-making ability."
"I must tell you sincerely that this is an area in which the Member States have initiative of legislation."
"Can Mr von Boetticher have asked himself why if, in these matters, the Commission proposals are as bad as he says, no Member State has tabled a proposal that has rapidly achieved the consensus of the fifteen Member States and has been adopted?"
"This is an issue which I believe is relevant."
"The only innovation in this proposal, admittedly, is to extend the concept of cause of persecution to cover persecution by non-State actors."
"This is true."
"This is the situation in thirteen of the fifteen Member States, and has recently also been incorporated into German law."
"Am I really the most appropriate target for Mr von Boetticher's words?"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I first wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, who has studied this matter, to which she has dedicated considerable energy and commitment here in Parliament."
"As she points out, hacking, viruses and denial of service can have very serious consequences, both as a result of individuals acting in their own interests and as part of organised crime or terrorism."
"The Commission proposal aims to approximate criminal offences of unauthorised access or illegal interference with information systems and follows consultation with professional sectors and with the authorities responsible for implementing the law, as well as discussions with experts in the European Union forum on cybercrime."
"The Commission is seeking to establish a degree of approximation in legislation at European level, but which is in line and coherent with the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention of November 2001."
"Article 3 of our proposal defines unauthorised access to an information system as an offence."
"What we are attempting to do is to punish hacking."
"Such unauthorised access must be punished when perpetrated against an information system that is subject to specific protection measures or with the intent to cause damage to a singular or collective person, or with the intention of obtaining economic benefit."
"Equally, we are making illegal interference with information systems a crime, thereby addressing the issue of attacks by means of viruses and denial of service as well as the disruption of websites."
"The Commission proposal requires all offences to be committed in an intentional and unauthorised way and focuses above all on serious cases, the criteria for decisions on which must be decided on by the judges of the courts in each Member State."
"The proposal caters for aggravating circumstances and also seeks to force Member States to designate operational points of contact, available around the clock and seven days a week, with a view to facilitating the exchange of information on attacks against information systems."
"The Commission considers that the rapporteur is entirely right to emphasise that the actions to be punished should not be considered to be insignificant or minor."
"Recital 12 of the Commission proposal therefore suggests that we must avoid excessive criminalisation, particularly for behaviour which is not very serious or which is even insignificant."
"The Commission agrees, for example, with the proposal for an amendment tabled by the rapporteur on this issue."
"With regard to the issue of data protection under the third pillar, we are working on this matter, but I would like to ask Parliament not to suspend implementation of this proposal for a framework decision until there is a specific instrument to protect data under the third pillar."
"Instead, I think that specific reference must be made to respect for the principles established in the Council of Europe Convention on Data Protection, which must be fully complied with in this field of the framework decision's implementation."
"As a matter of fact, this was the solution adopted for the issue of the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur once again for her contribution to this important debate which, I believe, has been much hoped for by public opinion in the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, we have followed each other's efforts for many years in the fight against cybercrime and no doubt have many basic values in common."
"Mr Vitorino knows as well as I do that we are concerned here with a framework directive."
"Because the European Parliament has significantly weaker decision-making powers than it ought to have where framework directives are concerned, I would take this opportunity to draw attention to this deficiency, as I also did in the case of the point raised by Mr Vitorino when commenting upon the amendment."
"I understand his point of view very well, but it is from our position here in Parliament that we must exert pressure on the Convention and on developments, for what we have here are extremely worrying threats to our common union."
"There is information to the effect that criminal organisations have infiltrated vital infrastructures."
"They have obtained access to digital circuit-breakers, which means that electricity and water can be switched off and transport brought to a halt."
"In particular, there have been incidents in the area of aviation that have affected the operation of control towers."
"Terrorists could switch off both gas and water, increasing the damage caused in connection with a physical attack."
"That is, of course, a situation that we must do everything to avert."
"We are concerned here with cross-border crime."
"The Commission's proposal is a good one."
"I admire Mr Vitorino for his ability to present sound proposals, in spite of the defective framework he has to work within."
"The idea of these minimum/maximum penalties that we traditionally use for harmonisation purposes is sensible and fair."
"It may also put an end to the type of 'legal shopping', which we cannot of course encourage, in which criminals have the option of being sentenced in countries that have lower penalties."
"We are also concerned here with intent."
"That too is abundantly clear, which I think is very commendable."
"There must be intent, the purpose being to cause damage or to procure an economic benefit."
"I think that this is a proper approach."
"I approve of the spirit of the Commission's work, but I want to repeat that the decision-making process is unacceptable."
"The EC Court of Justice has no competence in the area of the third pillar."
"The current system causes democratic rights to be neglected."
"Human rights lie outside the jurisdiction of the Court."
"That is why I give extra special emphasis to this in an amendment, something which Mr Vitorino too surely understands."
"The crimes in question can have long-term consequences, and they have direct effects upon people's private lives."
"We must obtain democratic control, and I should therefore like this legislation to begin to apply from the day on which we have proper protection in this area and also data protection in the area of the third pillar."
"That is something I should obviously like to see right now."
"I fully appreciate that the operational contact points have to be set up."
"I do not want to slow things down in any way, but I want to give some impetus to democratic development."
"That is as far as we can get with today's decision-making system."
"I hope, however, that a new constitution will mean our sorting out these issues and really being able to obtain a legitimate system."
"Commissioner Vitorino has already made positive comments about the amendments."
"That also applies to the subtle attitude to legal persons."
"I am also pleased that we have a common position where minors are concerned."
"I want to conclude by thanking all my fellow MEPs."
"I have tried to strike a balance involving as effective an assault upon crime as possible. At the same time, I have tried, within our present framework, to raise the profile of human rights and the protection of privacy."
"I want the Convention to feel it is under pressure, which is why I have written in this way."
"That is something which Mr Vitorino surely understands, and I hope that he will help exercise this pressure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mrs Cederschiöld on the excellent report she has presented, which the European People's Party supports and will vote for."
"We are facing a problem of considerable topical interest, which has assumed worrying dimensions and which has today become a form of organised crime, with a transnational nature, which must be responded to at Community level, because the new information and communication technologies have a fundamental impact on the daily life of the citizens and on the economy of our societies."
"It is therefore crucial that there should be rigorous protection against potential abuses or criminal acts."
"Hacking, in whatever form, is an economic risk, risks a loss of confidence in electronic commerce and also poses a threat to individual privacy."
"The targets of these attacks are not only network operators, Internet service providers and electronic commerce businesses, but also private persons who have no commercial intentions."
"The protection of information systems is a crucial element in creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"We must, however, guarantee that no restrictions are imposed on fundamental rights and freedoms, that fundamental principles of law are not changed and that individual acts that take place purely as a result of mistakes in the use of new technologies are not punished."
"As I have already said in this plenary, security is and must be only one tool for safeguarding these fundamental rights and freedoms."
"The Cederschiöld Report contains five essential points: firstly, the approximation of criminal law in the Member States in the field of attacks against information systems; secondly, stepping up police and judicial cooperation in this field; thirdly, enhancing prevention, promoting a culture of security, making actors aware of security risks to information networks; fourth, the existence of flexibility in criminal law on unimportant issues or those of lesser importance, thereby avoiding imposing binding, criminalising measures at European level; fifthly and lastly, and this demonstrates special consideration for young people, to allow judges the possibility to acquit minors who are charged for the first time with this type of offence, and who did not commit this misdemeanour with the intent of causing damage or procuring an economic benefit or creating prospective profits for a criminal organisation."
"Mr President, despite the excellent work of Mrs Cederschiöld, who has made considerable improvements to the Commission proposal, we will vote against the motion, for there are at least four basic problems whose importance cannot and must not be underestimated: firstly, the typically European obsession with over-regulating the Internet with specific laws; secondly, the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice based on the harmonisation of permitted terms of imprisonment; thirdly, the excessive control measures which automatically criminalise all behaviour which could be described as an attack against information systems; and fourthly, the illusion that it is possible to clamp down on crime by making sentences harsher rather than by improving the effectiveness of controls."
"Basically, we believe that it would be preferable to address the issue of crimes committed on the Internet with criminal law instruments already in existence rather than producing piles of specific legislation based on technological considerations which, moreover, would be characterised by the flaws which I have mentioned."
"These are the reasons why we will be voting against the motion."
"These problems were essentially also raised by Mrs Cederschiöld and Mr Coelho, but we feel they are vitally important and cannot be ignored."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, data processing and information transfer, and the assurance that these activities can be free from interference, are vitally important in today's information society."
"Who of us has not been afraid a virus might have got into their computer or actually suffered damage caused by a computer virus?"
"Viruses can have unforeseen consequences for those using computers."
"Examples might include data altered or destroyed by a virus in air traffic control systems or in files held by healthcare units such as the intensive care department of a hospital."
"This could have fateful consequences for both individuals and large numbers of people."
"Computer viruses in the future could cause legal uncertainty on a large scale and prevent electronic commerce and people's private business from being transacted electronically by sabotaging the reliability of electronic documents."
"That is why, ladies and gentlemen, our efforts to promote electronic commerce, for example, by creating the necessary legislative frameworks, will be in vain if these systems are not dependable."
"I am very concerned about the opinions of experts who say that those who are creating new viruses these days are less and less those who are just playing around."
"At first viruses were turned out by schoolchildren and students, who produced them mainly for fun and publicity, but more and more frequently viruses can destroy hard disks and all installed programs."
"According to the experts macro viruses already account for 80% of all viruses."
"People want to protect their privacy from intruders."
"I therefore agree with the views expressed earlier that hacking is turning into one form of organised crime, one that must be prevented particularly in the international context, because it is, by its very nature, a cross-border crime."
"The Commission proposal to prevent attacks against information systems and for the approximation of criminal law measures taken by Member States is thus a step in the right direction."
"Finally I want to thank our colleague, Charlotte Cederschiöld, for the valuable work she has done."
"I especially agree with her observation that the Union still has not enough data protection rules to deal with third pillar matters."
"The European Parliament on many an occasion has called for such rules to be drawn up, and I would urge the Commission to commence drafting them immediately."
"Mr President, I wish to say that, in the Commission, we are not simply obsessed with issues of suppressing crime; there are many other initiatives underway in this field; in prevention, security, and encryption and in guaranteeing the privacy of information systems."
"This was not the subject of this debate, which is why I did not refer to our actions in this field, but was taking them for granted."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, I speak as shadow rapporteur on behalf of my group."
"We congratulate Mrs Frays on her report and will broadly support its adoption."
"We have tabled two amendments which we hope the House will accept."
"The report constitutes a useful analysis of measures to encourage theatre and the performing arts throughout the EU, particularly focusing on the need for mobility."
"Presaging the enlarged EU, the rapporteur's explanatory statement notes that the candidate countries could not support cultural programmes through the PHARE and TACIS programmes but that artistic cooperation has been enhanced through the THEOREM programme, by which they gained access to the Culture 2000 programme last year, as Commissioner Reding has just reminded us."
"In Mrs Fraisse's speech she drew attention to the need for vision and coherence in cultural matters in the EU and particularly in the enlarged EU."
"I very much support that."
"It is timely, following the Commission's announcement of approval for the ten candidate countries to accede to the EU and this weekend's referendum in Ireland, which cleared a potential obstacle to the enlarged EU."
"The EU's character is going to change very dramatically, particularly with the accession of the Central and East European countries."
"Culture surely has a huge role to play in this respect."
"To what extent does the existing programme deal with the years of collective amnesia in Western Europe, perhaps not so much in Germany and Austria, where there were always historical and family links, but in other countries where the shadow of the iron curtain still exists."
"Bearing in mind Mrs Fraisse's call for vision and coherence, have we really done enough to bring home to the public in the present EU what completing the European family is going to mean, in the theatre and performing arts as well as other cultural fields?"
"When Stalin outlined his project for Central and Eastern Europe, Winston Churchill's reply was 'the eagle must let the small bird sing'."
"I wonder whether we feel today that all the institutions of the EU have done enough to let the small bird sing."
"Mr President, I too should like to take my turn in congratulating the rapporteur for having made a quantum leap and married her vision to political considerations, a rare feat indeed here."
"We all want a revival of the arts, and the performing arts in particular, and we feel that enlargement really will allow us to enter a new era in Europe."
"I am sure that each and every one of us, like the Commissioner, is eager to contribute to this revival in our own way, by providing a number of political tools."
"I have to say that the report, which I made a point of sending to numerous theatrical agencies in Greece, has excited a great deal of interest and they are waiting to see how tomorrow's vote goes and who votes against it."
"I think that political intervention to bring about an area of performing arts is extremely important and I just have one or two comments to make."
"Commissioner, I know that you are not responsible, but the statistics are so late, they are causing confusion and muddying the waters."
"We need these statistics and your support is important here."
"It is also important for dramatic works to be translated."
"They cannot appear first in book form and then as translations."
"Dramatic works really do need to circulate among artists as translations if they are to travel."
"And finally, the whole situation is in a state of flux."
"We have a Canadian initiative on international cultural collaboration, we have the ongoing discussion within the World Trade Organisation, and we shall have to wait and see how these situations develop."
"So we have to harness our vision to political ideas which will bring about a cultural policy which revives rather than renationalises the performing arts, a policy that offers specific ways of making our dreams come true for European culture."
"Since time immemorial, people have been involved in theatre in one form or other, and each nationality has developed it own preferences and forms of expression."
"I would therefore like to thank Mrs Fraisse for her initiative to map out the state of affairs with regard to performing arts in the EU and the candidate countries."
"Given the wide area and the many variations in the different countries, it is a valiant and successful effort."
"Nevertheless, I should like to make a few observations."
"Firstly, theatre exists by the grace of its producers, directors and actors, and I should like to add the theatre-going public to this list, for without an audience, there is no theatre."
"Many theatres and theatre forms have followers who unite in one way or another in 'friends of ?', and I believe that they too deserve a mention when the topic of supporting the dramatic arts is mooted."
"They offer incentives, information and bring theatre to the attention of a wide public."
"This aspect is, sadly, missing from the report."
"Secondly, I should also like to expressly draw your attention to the role of information technologies in modern theatre."
"Modern theatre productions increasingly incorporate modern technology in their performances."
"This trend deserves our attention and must certainly be included in fresh theatre policy, for it indeed pertains to a typically European task in the field of innovation."
"Thirdly, my group has major objections to the appeal for more financial support."
"We believe that enough attention is being given to this aspect by 'Culture 2000', the structural funds and the Socrates and Leonardo programmes, upon which the Commissioner, in fact, enlarged."
"Finally, more tax allowances for the mobility of those who are culturally active is a taboo subject in my group."
"We agree that double taxation is naturally exaggerated, but the award of special tax allowances would be a reason for us to abstain from Mrs Fraisse's entire report during the final vote."
"Mr President, Mrs Zorba, Commissioner, on the contrary, theatre is not dead."
"It has been pronounced dead at regular intervals ever since it came into being."
"It lives!"
"Deserving protection as the biotope of every democratic society, the theatre lives not only thanks to the antics of its exponents, but also thanks to public interest and childlike curiosity, and thanks to national policies."
"We all know that this responsibility is borne by the Fifteen, soon to be twenty-five and more."
"Like Mr Beazley and others who have spoken before me, I wonder whether everyone is truly aware of the enormous political and delicate task that we have been set to do."
"The business world has galloped on ahead, but the EU's citizens are still tottering along behind integration."
"Europe must help where it can."
"Let me first thank you, Geneviève Fraisse, for your initiative, and for this wonderful report."
"If, within the internal market framework, we enact laws relating to culture, we must also make full use of every instrument at our disposal in the service of the many kinds of theatre - whether houses rich in tradition, buildings commandeered for alternative uses, streets between Lisbon and Helsinki, Athens and London - to protect this diversity, helping it to develop further and come to full bloom."
"This will call for a shared effort on the part of all of us."
"It is primarily to the Member States that I appeal."
"We have to do away with fiscal discrimination as part of European mobility policy and as an essential contribution to integration."
"We have to exploit to the utmost all the options that the framework of the sixth VAT directive offers us and win over the media, for they - especially the public broadcasting institutions - are our partners."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your observations."
"Take this report as a mandate and as a support."
"Do not let it gather dust in a drawer; it is too valuable to be eaten away by moths."
"No holes in the Budget are stopped if we cut back on art and culture; we are just the poorer thereby."
"Mr President, I am not going to speak to you about those working in the entertainment industry on short-term contracts, the number of which has doubled in France in five years and has reached the incredible figure of 90 000, and whom the rapporteur is trying to federate. I shall, instead, speak about pluralism in French television, particularly as far as the so-called public service networks are concerned."
"We must do everything necessary so that these television channels, which receive more than EUR 2 billion in subsidies from the French Government every year, at last respect the principles that are at the very core of their public service duty, in other words, the principles of democracy and respect for all political opinions."
"I am speaking of the so-called journalists and big prize-budget producers who are behaving in the manner of the worst campaigners of politically correct misinformation."
"In this respect, the disgraceful behaviour of Antenne 2 and FR 3 between the two rounds of the French presidential election was unacceptable and flouts the most basic rules of the professional code of ethics of journalism."
"It would be a great credit to the current government to impose the necessary penalties against the two or three presenters who were guilty of professional misconduct."
"Lastly, in order to avoid confusion between journalism and propaganda in the future, each state or private television channel should organise a debate involving the main representative political views ?"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I assume that it had escaped Mr de Gaulle's mind that our discussion today is on theatre rather than television or journalists."
"I would prefer to speak to the matter on the agenda."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs Fraisse and say something on just a couple of points that have not yet been mentioned today."
"First of all, I am glad that a Member has taken up this matter again after an interval of ten years, in the course of which the issue has lost none of its topicality."
"It was in 1992 that I produced a report on the state of artists, and I can only say that I still search in vain today for the practical results that the Commission could have brought about in these ten years."
"Whilst believing that the topics addressed today are very multi-faceted, I would nonetheless like to limit myself to two things, the first being the way in which the cultural sector is financed at both national and European level."
"It is the subject of politicians' speeches, but does not give rise to political action, and it is for that reason that I believe much is still amiss in this area."
"I would like to observe that there are two things that are in need of improvement."
"Firstly, the Culture 2002 programme, to which Mrs Reding has already referred, has to have more money allocated to it; if the Council of Ministers suddenly attaches such importance to culture, then it should provide funds for it."
"In addition, we should also bear in mind that it is the performing arts that are popular with quite specific viewers and listeners."
"So far, these are small-scale projects, for which the Commission has no love, but which we want because the public likes them!"
"Secondly, the private sector must be involved more than it has been before."
"Patronage and sponsorship are important."
"There are no Budget resources available, and so we have to look for ways to enable people with a lot of money to spend it in the right way."
"That is why we should do more about this."
"I regret the way that the coalition agreements in my own country mean that it is precisely this that is to be done away with."
"Thirdly, artists face a very large number of technical obstacles in terms of the material they have to work with, and here in particular the Commission could really do something, for example, for circuses and small travelling theatres."
"Please do something in this area; it would be a great help to the performers!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fraisse's Report contains many positive points, which require answers at Community level if we persist in hoping that Commission policies will produce a genuinely European stamp for these projects."
"Recital F rightly points out that the vitality of the theatre and performing arts should not depend chiefly on public subsidies."
"It is, in fact, extremely important to boost the diversification of funding sources and to strengthen sponsorship policies, with the corresponding tax relief likely to attract sponsors."
"It is also important, however, that the performing arts develop a satisfactory business dimension."
"We live in a market economy and neither the State not the European Union should act as a wet nurse or a nanny for cultural creation."
"There is no justification whatsoever for the performing arts as a rule to be directly supported by a system of public subsidy for productions."
"It is more important for cultural creation to run the risks inherent to it and that public resources facilitate international promotion, distribution, greater accessibility of content through translation and subtitling and proper co-production, in the spirit of the 'Culture 2000' Programme."
"There is, however, every reason why artistic training from childhood, as well as contact with cultural creation in all spheres - and therefore with the arts and performing artists - judiciously promoted from school onwards, should make a decisive contribution to finding new publics, which we can expect will lead to an increase in the demand for cultural consumption likely, at least in part, to sustain the corresponding supply."
"What makes no sense is to reduce supply and funding for supply without seeing any significant growth in audiences, which are still lacking."
"Let us hope that the Fraisse Report is also a step in this direction."
"It was a misunderstanding."
"I thought that you were asking to take the floor, when in fact you were applauding the rapporteur."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 9.50 p.m.)"
"Medicinal products"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy by:"
"Mrs Rosemarie Müller (A5-0330/2002) on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products [COM(2001) 404 - C5-0591/2001 - 2001/0252(COD)];"
"Mrs Françoise Grossetête (A5-0340/2002) on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use [COM(2001) 404 - C5-0592/2001 - 2001/0253(COD)];"
"Mrs Françoise Grossetête (A5-0334/2002) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2001/82/EC on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products [COM(2001) 404 - C5-0593/2001 - 2001/0254(COD)]."
"Commissioner Liikanen has the floor."
". Mr President, before briefly introducing the three Commission proposals, I would like to thank and congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all the work and effort they have put into finalising these three reports."
"Let me start with the objectives of the proposals."
"There are three."
"First and foremost, to guarantee a high level of health protection for European citizens, and that is always the starting point."
"Secondly, to increase the availability of innovative medicinal products and, at the same time, favour competition with generic products, and, thirdly, to prepare for enlargement, which will very soon become a reality."
"As far as the concrete proposals are concerned, I will concentrate on three of them."
"First, the need to reinforce the role of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the centralised procedure."
"Why?"
"Because the objective is to make new innovative medicines available to all EU citizens, at the same time."
"This is a question of equality of all patients in Europe."
"Thus, the Commission has proposed that the centralised authorisation procedure for all medicines containing new active substances be made mandatory."
"This is the Community solution to the issue of innovation availability and I hope that this House will support it."
"Additionally, this would produce economies of scale, save resources and time and, finally, lead to improved regulatory efficiency."
"The Commission wants, especially in the enlarged EU, to ensure that patients have quicker access to innovative medicines."
"The mutual recognition procedure has shown its limits."
"The evaluation process at the London agency takes an average of 180 days - clearly fewer than the maximum of 210 days provided for in the legislation."
"The centralised procedure would also be positive for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Let us take the example of biotechnology."
"SMEs are very active in this field, where centralised authorisation is already mandatory."
"Experience has not brought any major problems to light."
"The benefits of a centralised procedure for SMEs are obvious in areas such as orphan drugs, where most of the marketing authorisations are granted to SMEs."
"This said, the Commission could, with a view to an overall solution, seek supporting measures for SMEs if there are particular obstacles, to help SMEs overcome them."
"Secondly, we need to find the right balance between innovation and competition from generics."
"Why is this so important?"
"To put it in a nutshell, we need innovative products for the benefit of patients and we need generics to help reduce the pressure on health care costs."
"How then are these needs to be balanced?"
"For innovative medicines, the Commission proposes a new data-protection period."
"For generics, entry to the market will be speeded up."
"How will this happen?"
"First, the Commission proposes to harmonise the national data protection periods at 10 years across the board."
"This will provide a harmonised solution for Europe."
"The protection period will give the innovative pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to recover its R& D investments."
"This will also allow for the smoother operation of the internal market."
"To reward further innovation and research in new products, the proposal provides for a possible extension of the protection period up to 11 years."
"For generics, the Commission proposes to change a long-standing EU policy."
"We propose now, for the first time in EU legislation, that trials may begin on generics before the expiry of the patent or other form of intellectual property protection."
"This will speed up the marketing of generics on most of the national markets and will substantially help to increase competition."
"The Commission believes that this is a balanced proposal."
"It takes account of the interests of the innovative European pharmaceutical industry, which is losing ground compared with the industry in the United States."
"It means fewer jobs and less research in Europe unless we do things differently."
"At the same time, it will facilitate the development of a competitive market in generics, and that means medicines at lower cost for European citizens."
"Finally, I should like to say a few words about controlled access to information for patients."
"I knew this would be a difficult discussion, but, first of all, the Commission is not proposing an American type of direct advertising to patients."
"The discussions have concentrated to a large extent on the US model, but this is not our model."
"The facts of the matter are that a lot of fragmented information is already available on the web, at least for English-speaking patients."
"This has two major drawbacks: firstly, it discriminates against non-English-speaking people and, secondly, it means that the information can be piecemeal and unreliable."
"Our proposal is that European citizens should obtain information that has been validated by European regulatory authorities and that follows guidelines to be agreed between the Member States and the Commission."
"It is a prudent proposal."
"It is a European pilot project, and has nothing in common with the US model."
"The alternatives to what we have today are, on the one hand, the continuation of massive direct advising to patients via the web."
"We cannot change this situation by our legislation."
"The alternative is to enable patients to obtain sound information, validated by the competent European authorities, on medicines for a small number of diseases."
"I think that this second option increases both choice and security for European patients."
"In conclusion, the Commission proposals aim to guarantee a high level of public health to European citizens, to increase, in a balanced way, the availability of innovative medicinal products and generic products and also to be ready for enlargement."
"This is a challenging piece of legislation."
"I am looking forward to the debate in the House today and to continued cooperation with Parliament and the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in examining the legislation before us, we need to consider whether more EU involvement is needed when it comes to approving innovative medicinal products, or whether the mutual recognition procedure is the best approach."
"In other words, do we want a more integrated internal market for medicinal products with a view to giving patients throughout Europe swifter access to new, safe and effective medicines, or is the idea that extremely complicated authorisation procedures should continue to keep new medicines out of patients' hands for as long as possible?"
"I would like to argue in favour of the wider registration of medical products with new active substances."
"This has advantages not only for patients, but also for companies, because they can market medicines more quickly than up to now and thus enhance their competitiveness."
"The support proposed for SMEs should compensate for the drawbacks of the centralised authorisation procedure, which do hit them."
"As I see it, legislation should focus on patients and their needs."
"That means that safety and the effectiveness of medical products must play a key role in the authorisation procedure."
"The procedure must be transparent."
"Patients, doctors and companies alike must therefore have access to any information not covered by business secrecy protection."
"In future, comprehensive information on progress with the authorisation procedure, on clinical tests carried out and on side effects and the prices of medical products will be downloadable at any time from a public database."
"In this connection, I regret that the Commission's information project on asthma, diabetes and AIDS did not receive the support of a majority of the committee."
"The Commission proposal was certainly ambiguous and gave rise to fears that advertising for prescription medicines was to be permitted."
"However, the committee's decision meant that an opportunity to improve patient information has been lost."
"I feel sure that this ought to be put right over the next few years."
"Pharmacovigilance, that is to say monitoring and reporting of side effects, is important to the safety of a medical product."
"The obligation to report side effects and submit periodic reports to the authorisation authority ensures continuous comprehensive assessment of any given medical product."
"There is a very effective safety net in the field of pharmacovigilance."
"This makes it easier to ascertain side effects and makes it possible to act quickly in the event of a crisis."
"For these reasons it will be possible to dispense with the procedure for relicensing products every five years."
"Another key aspect of reform is the plan to prepare the boards and committees of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for their future remits and for the enlargement of the EU."
"The structure of the EAEMP is intended to reflect that of the EU Food Safety Authority, with an open application procedure for the Management Board and the Executive Director."
"Anyone wishing to become a member of one of the agency's boards or committees should have a high degree of scientific expertise and must declare any relevant interests."
"In addition to the existing scientific committees, there will in future be a committee for herbal medicinal products with the same status."
"This will make voluntary central authorisation for herbal medicines possible, giving patients throughout Europe the option of using tried and tested herbal medicines."
"In addition to health protection, which is important for patients, there is also the issue of competitiveness and innovation in Europe's pharmaceutical industry."
"The harmonisation of data exclusivity is certainly a step towards increased competitiveness."
"Under the present arrangements, data exclusivity in Europe ranges from six to ten years, and this is in urgent need of harmonisation."
"The 10-year-rule gives a signal to pharmaceutical companies to intensify research and market truly innovative products."
"However, it also gives a signal to generic drug manufacturers to use the Bolar provisions."
"As I see it, the Commission proposal is a successful attempt to strike a balance between the justifiable desire of pharmaceutical companies to protect their data and the need of public health systems to improve access to cost-effective generic drugs."
"All in all, the legislation before us will make an important contribution to improving health protection in Europe, which will be of lasting benefit to patients."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the subject that we are discussing today is one of the most important themes of our parliamentary term, since it ultimately concerns every European citizen."
"Allow me, first of all, to thank all my fellow Members from all the political groups for the discussions that we have had and the work that they have performed via the 800 amendments."
"In my opinion, there are rather too many amendments, which may be very detrimental to the quality and coherence of our work."
"The main objective of the proposals is to ensure a high level of health protection for each citizen, particularly by providing rapid access to innovative and safe products, by developing a preventative and on-going system of pharmacovigilance, as well as by improving the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry within the framework of its search for new treatments."
"We must not forget the essential boost which must be given to the generic medicinal products industry."
"A medicinal product is a product unlike any other."
"It is not purchased or consumed like an ordinary, everyday consumer item."
"Its use is unique and everyone expects a medicinal product to be safe and to work effectively."
"Safety, quality and efficacy are the three essential pillars of the European medicinal products market."
"Before being made available to patients, medicinal products must pass through specific and restricted phases in order to obtain a marketing authorisation."
"At present, there are two procedures for registering medicinal products: the centralised procedure, managed by the European Agency, under which authorisations valid for all EU Member States are issued, and the mutual recognition procedure, for which the Member States have jurisdiction."
"It is not our intention to alter the existing dual structure; the main task is to optimise the way it works."
"In reality, the question raised concerns new, active substances."
"We all agree that there is a difference between new active substances, which number almost 20 per year, and the new drugs, which amount to between 200 and 300 each year."
"Therefore, the Commission is proposing to introduce the registration, by means of a centralised procedure, of new molecules, so as to ensure that everyone has access to the most innovative therapies."
"Some Members wanted to question the principle."
"I would like to say to them that we are faced with a critical choice."
"You will choose between either health or the market."
"By adopting the amendment which calls the scope into question, we must respond to the following: how do we explain to those who are ill that their European neighbours will be able to benefit from an innovative and effective treatment, but that they will have to wait a few years until the authorisation is granted to their country?"
"Faced with this perspective, let us take an extreme case involving enlargement: citizens from Slovenia and Portugal could, for example, be treated with a new therapy, but a German or Cypriot citizen could not have access to it."
"What do we do, in this case, as regards equality in the area of health?"
"Some Members will say that the centralised procedure is costly for SMEs, but in the case of enlargement, the cost of 25 applications for market authorisation using the decentralised procedure will be much higher."
"We are all mindful of the recent examples of medicinal products withdrawn from the market on public health grounds."
"We know that the issuing of an authorisation for a medicinal product does not, however, mean that checks are no longer needed on its efficacy and safety."
"It is thus essential to step up pharmacovigilance requirements, in order to offer patients the best possible guarantees, in other words with ad-hoc inspections at the source of manufacturing, using purely public funding, which is indispensable if independence is to be guaranteed and, lastly, by means of a rapid system for exchanging data collated by all the partners, which will make it possible to achieve coherence in pharmacovigilance systems between Member States."
"In order to manufacture a medicinal product, the applicant first needs to carry out extensive research in order to discover new molecules."
"We all know that innovation comes at a price."
"Industry therefore needs to guarantee the protection of this data."
"It is our duty to encourage research to ensure that science moves forward, hence the interest in retaining our best researchers."
"We also need to ensure patient safety, but equally to prevent Europe's industries from falling too far behind other countries, from the United States and Asia."
"Of course, the usefulness of generic drugs has already been demonstrated."
"They illustrate the success of our European health systems."
"The introduction of adequate measures, therefore, particularly by means of the Bolar system will speed up their launch on to the market."
"We must also remember that generic products are only developed due to innovation."
"I am also expecting all the Member States to run an information campaign for the general public, in order to explain what a generic product is, whilst stressing it is the therapeutic equivalent of the reference medicinal product."
"With regard, more specifically, to veterinary medicinal products, the main challenge is to contend with the problem of the availability of these medicinal products."
"A balance has been sought between making some provisions more flexible, such as the 'cascade provisions' and maintaining the highest level of safety for the consumer, in the case of food-producing animals."
"When there is no medicinal product available for a condition or a given animal, the cascade system allows the use of medicinal products designed for other species, for other conditions or even the use of medicinal products for human use."
"This system was improved and broadened for optimal effectiveness and safety."
"The Commission is proposing to extend the compulsory prescription to all medicinal products designed for food-producing animals, which poses a problem for some Member States, including Ireland and the United Kingdom."
"A compromise amendment, adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes this measure consistent with the national provisions."
"Lastly, we cannot speak about the revision of European pharmaceutical legislation without addressing the issue of information and the Commission proposal, which seeks to provide authorisation, on an experimental basis, over five years. We must also address the communication, by industry, of information relating to specific medicinal products for the following conditions: asthma, AIDS and diabetes."
"The medicinal products market is unique and our objective must not be to encourage maximum sales."
"It is vital to maintain a very clear distinction between information and advertising and to place a strict ban on the latter."
"There is no better information than that given by a doctor or a pharmacist."
"Information systems, however, particularly via the Internet, have been widely developed and it appears quite unfair that only those who have access to the Internet and can speak English are able to gather this data, and not other people."
"We must avoid, however, any move leading to the development of deceptive and misleading information that seeks to promote the prescription, sale or taking of a specific medicinal product."
"The Committee on the Environment rejected the Commission proposal by a huge majority, as it was deemed to be overly ambiguous."
"This unmitigated rejection poses a problem, however."
"I hoped that the concepts of information and advertising would be better defined, and I proposed a system for the prior validation of the information by neutral scientific organisations."
"This proposal could pave the way for the foundation of an exhaustive new study, which we are awaiting from the Commission."
"On the other hand, there is an essential source of information. I am referring to package leaflets."
"All the amendments tabled on this issue seek to improve the way they are written, to make them clearer and easier to understand."
"This is a very positive point."
"To sum up, I must stress the importance of enlargement."
"We cannot deny the fact that the revision which will be adopted will apply to the incoming countries."
"That is why I proposed, in particular, what I shall refer to as the 'euro-generic' product."
"Within some of the candidate countries and for historical or economic reasons, reference medicinal products have never been registered."
"The updating of generic authorisations in accordance with European legal requirements in the candidate countries therefore requires the possibility of referring to a reference product."
"The absence of such a product could pave the way for an obligation to withdraw generic medicinal products from the market, which nonetheless conform to the requirements of quality, security and effectiveness."
"This is a situation which causes problems of access to generic medicinal products."
"It therefore seems important that a reference medicinal product present in another Member State be able to serve as a reference."
"Each new candidate country has an important role to play as a fully committed player in the integration and development of this 'Europe of health' that we are all hoping and praying will be realised."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as permanent rapporteur for agencies in the Committee on Budgets, I have been following these reports, which regulate the operation of the London-based medical products agency, that is the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products."
"I am very grateful to the rapporteur and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for having taken our suggestions on board in their reports."
"There is, however, one thing I would to make very clear to this House, and this also applies of course to the Commission and the Member States."
"If we are to give an agency new remits, then we also need to consider where the money for carrying out those tasks is to come from."
"We cannot just keep increasing the size of an agency."
"We have a General Budget that only provides us with a certain amount, and Parliament cannot top it up - we can only restructure it."
"So if we wish to allocate financial means to an agency in future, we have to take those means away from another agency."
"I know that I am not making myself popular by making these statements, but I am not here to be popular."
"We need to bear in mind in future that an agency can only carry out the tasks assigned to it with the money at its disposal, and that it cannot act as it likes beyond that."
"That is not possible, because we do not have the money for that."
"Mr President, I should like to offer my congratulations to the two rapporteurs on an enormously complicated and difficult task."
"They have highlighted - as will I - the importance of this industry a major employer of this industrial research base."
"It is so important to keep in the European Union, both for the European Union and, above all, for consumers who want safe, effective and affordable medicines."
"Added to that are the complex needs of the sectors in the industry, of which there are at least three: the in-patent sector, the generic sector and the over-the-counter sector."
"Many of the amendments are seeking to strike the correct balance between them."
"We have to encourage the in-patent sector to develop new medicines but the generic sector also provides affordable medicines."
"If you add to this the whole question of access and affordability on a global scale, you can see just how complex an area this is."
"I want to draw attention to just three points."
"One is the authorisation procedure."
"I am urging colleagues to accept duality, at least in the immediate future."
"Mrs Grossetête perhaps needs to re-examine the whole question of the centralised procedure and access."
"The fact that medicines are authorised does not mean that they are automatically placed on the market."
"This applies particularly to veterinary medicines."
"In their case I really believe that duality should continue."
"On the question of advertising and consumer information, I urge Parliament to accept the amendment that asks the Commission to look again at this issue."
"The Commission is right - information is available to some, but not to all."
"That is almost beyond our control."
"On data exclusivity, the balance that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has come up with is the right one."
"I hope that Parliament will look at it sensibly."
"We are going to have an important second reading and possibly a conciliation, so we still have time to try and get this even more right that we have done so far."
". (IT) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête for their work and for the goodwill they have displayed in working on reports on subjects which are certainly difficult and complex for all but the experts."
"The primary objective of all the institutions - Parliament, the Commission and the Member States - should be to introduce, at last, new legislation which is better than the previous legislation and which will provide all patients, including those suffering from serious, terminal illnesses, with as rapid access as possible to new medicinal products which are more powerful and easier to tolerate than existing medicinal products, to alleviate their suffering and extend and improve their quality of life."
"In the short space of time available to me, I will focus on just a few points."
"As regards the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, I am completely opposed to the proposal regarding the membership of the management board."
"A management board such as that proposed by the Commission, and by the rapporteur, Mrs Müller, too, would certainly be doomed to failure."
"The presence on the management board of members representing the institutions and, in addition, of members with conflicting interests - such as industry, patients and insurance companies - would only lead to confusion, wasted time and major disputes."
"The second point I would like to make concerns the centralised procedure, where evaluation is carried out by the European Agency."
"The concept of 'new medicinal product' needs to be better defined, Commissioner."
"What is meant by the term 'new medicinal product'?"
"Does it refer to a medicinal product which has the same structure as existing medicinal products but with a very small change, or does it actually refer to medicinal products with a new chemical structure?"
"I hope that you and the Council will think again on this matter."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs."
"I would add my great thanks to Mrs Grossetête with whom I have worked extremely closely on this particular issue."
"I am only here to represent the Committee on Agriculture on the veterinary medicines side."
"It would be remiss of me if I did not say at the outset that one of the problems facing agriculture is that it is going through the worst time it has ever had - I will not mention the problems facing British beef today."
"Any legislation that this Parliament adopts and pushes through the Commission could have a detrimental effect on industry if it is not put through correctly."
"Mrs Grossetête has worked extremely well with me and other members on the veterinary medicines bill and, therefore, we will totally support all the legislation in that bill."
"I would like to raise three issues."
"Mrs Read briefly covered one."
"I totally endorse what she says about what is termed 'duality'."
"One of the problems we have in the European Union is that animals in the very far north, for example, are not necessarily the same as animals in the south."
"I use the term 'the reindeer syndrome', which many colleagues will have heard me say before."
"Duality is something that will help to promote the proper use of medicines for species that are not found across the European Union."
"It may be difficult to get someone to spend the money to test these products for one particular species. Therefore, we have retabled Amendment No 137, which I hope the Commission and Mrs Grossetête will consider."
"I hope this House will consider supporting it."
"As I have mentioned, this would help those species that are not widespread."
"Mrs Grossetête mentioned the way that medicines are dispensed in certain countries."
"I am delighted that she has taken this on board. I fully support the compromise amendment, which is something I worked particularly hard in the Committee on Agriculture to get through."
"We are in a situation where Member States differ, firstly, in their definition of what a veterinary surgeon is and what it means and, secondly, in the dispensing of these drugs."
"In many instances in the United Kingdom, Ireland and one or two other countries, qualified people dispense minor medicines - in particular, products such as worming pills and flea powders."
"The real worry is not particularly with food-chain animals."
"But, if this option is removed, we are in a situation where the pets in the animal world will suffer because people will not be able to afford to go to a veterinary surgeon, for example, to get a worming pill for a cat."
"Therefore, it is important that we have flexibility."
"I am delighted that both rapporteurs have taken this on board and am totally in favour of it."
"The final point concerns the use of medicines for equine species."
"Again, if we are not careful, we are going to inflict hardship on animals that do not deserve it."
"For example, horses are not eaten in the United Kingdom."
"It may be that horsemeat is accepted in other countries."
"If the medicines available to us are restricted, then again it is the animal that suffers."
"Therefore, it is vitally important that the new Amendment No 65 for equine species is adopted."
"I shall leave it there, as I have covered the agricultural scene totally."
"I thank the two rapporteurs for taking on board the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and look forward to a worthwhile result."
"I hope the Commission will also follow my opinion."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for the exceptional reports they have tabled here for debate, especially Mrs Grossetête, with whom we had an excellent and highly productive working relationship."
"As regards the proposal to revise pharmaceutical legislation in order to maintain high standards of public health and complete the single market and, in the field of medicinal products, to meet the challenges of enlargement, apply a more functional and simplified procedure for authorising and supervising medicinal products - by which we mean medicinal products at affordable prices - and, finally, guarantee transparency and access to information on medical products for patients, I should like to comment briefly on the following points."
"Innovation: we depend on scientific research and innovation for new combinations of substances and new drugs to fight and cure disease."
"But this sort of research needs bold investment by the pharmaceutical industry and this is only feasible if we provide a framework of financial incentives."
"Incentives: these are based mainly on exclusivity, by which we mean protecting industrial property rights and inventions."
"As a result, the cost of developing a medicinal product is borne by the market and social security systems which, because of the ageing population, are now under tremendous pressure."
"So we need to strike a balance here between patented exclusivity, the price of medicinal products and the period of protection."
"This is a hard balance to strike."
"However, I think that the arrangements achieved in the regulation and now being proposed do strike a balance between exclusivity on the one hand and a reasonable period of protection on the other."
"Safety of medicinal products: this is also a serious requirement and the elements of quality and vigilance are also taken into account in this excellent report."
"Authorisation: I am in favour of a centralised procedure with a degree of decentralisation to the Member States."
"Finally, subsidiarity: this is a very important factor because it is the Member States that foot the bill and provide medical and medicinal care."
"Yesterday President Bush made a move precisely because the Member States are under huge financial pressure in this sector."
"Mr President, in its proposal, the Commission has tried to reform the pharmaceutical industry, or at least has tried to make a start on it."
"In the pharmaceutical industry, Europe is losing out to the United States."
"It is not for nothing that an increasing number of companies have decided to carry out their practical research and development in the United States."
"European legislation is too opaque, which dampens the companies' motivation to carry out their activities in Europe, and in order to counter this, better European coordination in this field is therefore necessary as a matter of priority."
"I am greatly in favour of opening up this fossilised market."
"We must therefore strive for more competition within the European market, and one of the ways of achieving this is, for example, by making generic medicines available sooner, something on which a sound compromise has been reached within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Furthermore, I would insist on the centralised procedure, which is carried out by the Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London, being reinforced so as to guarantee the equal treatment of all pharmaceutical companies and to give patients throughout Europe access to the same medicines."
"This centralised method also promotes all the objectives pursued by the Commission, such as a high level of health care, completion of the internal market, more transparency, improvement of competition and preparation for enlargement."
"I also set great store by the provision of information."
"It remains a mystery to me why the pharmaceutical industry is not allowed to inform patients about its products."
"I have said it before, but I should like to repeat it here: the European Union has thus been taken over by events and is discriminating against patients."
"At the moment, information of this kind is only available to people with a command of English and with access to the Internet, as this information is available in the United States."
"Patients who have no access to these resources are kept in the dark by Europe, and it is for this reason too that I think that the Commission's proposal to come up with a trial project is sound and is in any case a good first step."
"I do believe that by only making information on asthma, AIDS and diabetes available, patients suffering from other diseases are discriminated against, and I would call for this list to be extended."
"Finally, I should like to remark that the reinforcement of the role of patient organisations in this context is of course important at European level as well, including with a view to enlargement and to this centralised procedure."
"The Group of the Greens has tabled amendments to this effect, which I should like to endorse."
"Mr President, medicinal products are something quite ordinary and everyday."
"Virtually all of us have used them and come into contact with them."
"In other words, Parliament's power of co-decision in this area is important as a tangible example of the way European Parliament decisions can affect people's lives."
"Indeed, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have come to expect representations from many organisations across the board."
"On this occasion, I have been contacted by farming organisations, veterinary groups, agricultural co-operatives, pharmaceutical interests, health stores and numerous individual constituents."
"Each group has its own particular concerns, but one common theme emerges: the proposed legislation does not take sufficient account of the different situations in the Member States."
"This is surely a lesson for the Commission."
"In an ideal situation, the legislation proposed would take account of such diversity."
"We in Ireland breed horses primarily for sporting purposes and meat does not end up at the end of the food chain."
"Consequently, the same safeguards are not required for medicines given to horses."
"I could cite many more instances and I have tabled a number of amendments for my group to deal with some of the difficulties."
"I would say to the Commission that if we are to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of decision-making, we must reassure our citizens that their specific concerns have been taken into consideration."
"If we proceed with 'one size fits all' legislation which ignores the particularities of individual countries or regions, we risk alienating our citizens."
"In conclusion, we have just concluded a long referendum campaign in Ireland, with a successful outcome for the Nice Treaty, and one of the major issues throughout the campaign was the sense of powerlessness and distance."
"We, as legislators, have a responsibility to ensure that we bring the people with us and keep in touch with their everyday concerns"
"Finally, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs."
"Mr President, every human life is unique and valuable because it is a gift from God."
"Accordingly, every life deserves the best possible protection and care from the cradle to the grave."
"A smoothly running European medicines market fits in well with this ambition."
"Our group believes it to be of major importance that Europe does not present any obstacles which could frustrate the operation of the medicines market."
"We are therefore of the view that manufacturers of medicines must continue to have the choice between the centralised and decentralised registration of medicines."
"Compulsory centralised registration would hamper the necessary flexibility which regional products enjoy, it would lead to a brain drain from the national registration authorities and it could present too great a financial obstacle for SMEs, preventing them from introducing certain products onto the market."
"In addition, we are in favour of more research into the effects of medicines on children."
"To date, a large proportion of medicines administered to children has only been tested on adults, even though it is surely obvious that children are different from adults in terms of their metabolism, the necessary dosage and the administration method."
"Finally, we are against allowing medicines to be advertised, because this could lead to an unnecessary increase in the use of medicines."
"We are, however, in favour of providing patients with extensive information."
"We therefore await with interest the outcome of the trial proposed by the European Commission in which patients are actively provided with information."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us today a wide-ranging revision of the law on medicinal products in Europe."
"This will have an impact on the competitiveness of companies of all sizes in this sector and accordingly on a great many jobs."
"However, it also of course affects the entire trade, pharmacists and, last but not least, the patient."
"This mammoth document is, amongst other things, the result of a new strategy that the Commission has already been pursuing for several years."
"The volume of Community law, which currently stands at over 80 000 pages, is to be simplified and tightened up."
"In the case of this particular revision, a single legislative act is to be adopted, taking account of the various substantive changes required and codifying the remaining provisions."
"The many amendments tabled in committee and now once again in the plenary are just one indication of how difficult this undertaking is."
"I have enormous respect for the massive amount of work put in by the Commission and by our two rapporteurs, Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, but I am genuinely concerned that we may to some extent have lost track of the overall picture, so that some apparently less important issues have not perhaps been attended to."
"That is why I would like to draw your attention to homeopathic medicines, not just for humans but also for animals, and I urge you to support these amendments too."
"The European Parliament is a co-legislator here and we need to make sure that we do our work carefully."
"At first reading, we still have a lot of opportunities, but we should also leave the way open for the second reading."
"That is why I am asking for your support, but I am also calling on the Legal Service and on our rapporteurs to check whether the final outcome is coherent."
"Only the future can tell whether this pharmaceutical legislation will be easier for the Member States and other stakeholders to apply because of its reduced linguistic complexity."
"I would like to thank everyone involved and hope that this magnum opus will be a success."
"Mr President, in this brief time I would like to make two points, both in relation to veterinary medicines."
"In a way, they have been the poor relation in these debates because of the immense complexity of the situation with regard to human medicinal substances."
"Firstly, I would like to warn against the Commission's proposals under Article 67 that all veterinary medicines intended for food-producing animals should be available on prescription only."
"Some Member States, including my own, have a well-established distribution system that allows medicines for which veterinary involvement is not considered necessary for safe and effective use to be obtained without a veterinary certificate."
"I can see why some professional organisations in some other Member States would be opposed to that, but it has worked effectively for very many years in Ireland as well as the UK."
"When we now look at the enlargement of the Union, all kinds of problems will arise if we allow ourselves now to move towards a centralised system which allows only by prescription use of such medicines as are currently administered by qualified persons in countries like the UK."
"I therefore commend Amendment No 43 to the House."
"My second and last point is that on the mandatory centralised procedures proposed by the Commission, the committee decided to move to a more flexible system for human medicines, but did not follow that same route in terms of animal medicines."
"We should rectify that and we can do so through Amendment No 171."
"Finally, I would make the point that it is a mistake for the Commission to propose that we remove the five-year renewal requirement for marketing authorisation."
"That is a safety precaution we should retain."
"Commissioner and rapporteurs, I would like to thank our rapporteurs for their excellent work on a quite impenetrable matter."
"I normally do not thank the rapporteurs, but there is good reason to do so in this case, as it is extremely difficult to attempt to master the whole of this large area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the costs of medicines in many EU countries constitute the fastest growing element of healthcare costs."
"In many countries, the shortfall in funding specifically for medicines is quite large."
"I therefore believe it was important that the Health Ministers were involved in this issue before the Council was restructured to increase efficiency."
"I hope that the Health Ministers will also be involved in the future."
"I usually also remain highly sceptical when Parliament asks the Commission for more reports."
"This time, I believe, however, that it would be important for the Commission to follow up trends in medicine prices, taking into account differences in different countries."
"This may provide us with very valuable information on various restrictions."
"I support what my colleague Mr Maaten said on access to information and what the Commissioner said regarding the fact that the issue is not advertising but access to information."
"We have many examples of information and other support being given to doctors in an unacceptable manner."
"Monitoring information would allow us to keep better track of how much money is being used in this sector."
"I see this as important."
"I believe one of the major problems, which many of the amendments also seize upon, is that we have what has been referred to as paid research."
"Many respected newspapers have also given their pages over to this."
"Finally, I, like Mr Rod, stress that I am glad that the effect of medicines on the environment will also be taken into account."
"It is not that we wish to set up obstacles to medicines but that the positive effects must be evaluated in relation to other effects."
"Mr President, the centralised procedure is our preferred choice."
"Medicines should be accessible to all Europeans, particularly following enlargement."
"The fact that we have 500 amendments is to do with the different lobbies and, above all, with the conflict between new and generic medicines."
"I welcome the compromise that has been reached, which offers protection that lasts eight years."
"I can just about endorse the ten-year market protection for new medicines within the EU."
"However, it should be possible for manufacturers of generic medicines to sell their products in countries outside of Europe."
"Those countries are invariably poorer and would benefit from these cheaper medicines."
"My group is delighted that the Commission's proposal to authorise advertising for prescription medicines for AIDS, asthma and diabetes has suffered a crushing defeat in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Despite this, the Liberal Group has re-tabled this absurd proposal."
"In the USA, advertising for prescription medicines has been decontrolled for the past five years."
"Sales have increased by 80%, admittedly not only thanks to advertising, but even so."
"The American population has not become any healthier as a result."
"The pharmaceutical industry's profits, on the other hand, have soared."
"Patients are in great need of more information, but only if they ask for it."
"At the moment, they have to make do with American websites."
"Via the Internet and telephone helplines, it should be possible for patients to obtain information about medicines in their own language."
"The five-yearly re-evaluation of medicines has now become a formality."
"My group would prefer to see an improved re-evaluation procedure put in place, a re-evaluation with substance."
"Does a medicine have value-added?"
"The pharmaceutical industry is decidedly against this."
"I should, however, like to repeat that it is not commercial interests but health care that should come first."
"Many medicines are toxic substances."
"When they leave the body, they are often still toxic, also to the environment."
"This is why my group is very pleased that consideration will now also be given to the environment in the assessment of new medicines."
"The European Commission has dropped a major clanger in this respect."
"Is that because the Directorate-General of Industry is responsible?"
"Mr President, this is an area in which we have had considerable experience over the years, especially in respect of organophosphate pesticides, which are used as sheep dips and for a variety of other purposes."
"It is our experience that the licensing system in toto provides a false guarantee of safety, in that no predictive testing could accurately ascertain the full extent of toxicity and the potential health threat to humans or animals."
"Thus the key to safety is an effective post-licensing surveillance system, sensitive enough to identify adverse reactions speedily and to enable swift and effective action to be taken."
"This requires effective administrative and medical systems, including diagnostic systems, in each Member State."
"Again, our experience is that these systems are far from adequate."
"We therefore believe that it would be better to focus on this area, rather than extend an already over-complex code."
"Mr President, the problem of the great discrepancies in medicines policy in our Member States cannot be solved today."
"We are, however, taking a step in the right direction as far as greater harmonisation in registration is concerned and also with regard to the conditions for placing medicines, particularly generic medicines, on the market."
"Admittance to Member State markets, however, remains at the discretion of the individual Member States."
"One of today's important areas of discussion is the relationship between the original medicine and the generic product that is introduced onto the market once the patent and data protection have lapsed."
"A fragile compromise has been tabled, in respect of which I have tabled a better worded amendment."
"I would ask my fellow MEPs for their support, but I do endorse the compromise."
"In fact, I should also like to take this opportunity to issue a warning that speeding up the launch of a generic product will not automatically lead to lower costs."
"In the Netherlands, I have noticed that the price of a generic product there is higher than the price of the original medicine in a large number of Member States."
"I should also like to comment on pricing policy."
"Although we are once again bringing transparency to your attention, it is frustrating - and I am also addressing this comment to the rapporteurs of 1989 - that the directive on transparency is not being fleshed out."
"There are large discrepancies, and we will not solve them today."
"It is too ridiculous for words that medicines from the Netherlands, where the price paid by consumers for generic medicines is so high, are exported to other Member States in parallel."
"We should put a stop to this."
"Finally, I am not in favour of advertising."
"I am in favour of making self-regulating information accessible on the web."
"Whether this information originates from national agencies or the industry itself is irrelevant, as long as it is self-regulating."
"In my view, articulate consumers should not have to resort to websites in America but should also be able to access this information in Europe."
"I should ask you to carefully reconsider my amendments on this score."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the pharmaceutical industry is doing well, boasting high profits over a long period of time."
"Health budgets, on the other hand, are not in such good shape, unfortunately."
"Spending on medicines is increasing in most Member States."
"The development of medicines is not going well either."
"There is little real innovation in Europe and, what is worse, the development of medicines to fight the worldwide health crisis, is seriously lagging behind."
"Although this is a wholly unsatisfactory situation, we can use the review of pharmaceutical legislation to take steps in the right direction."
"We should first of all adopt a sound price policy."
"The price of medicines is determined at national level, and currently differs widely across the various European Member States."
"For new medicines, the Commission should lay down a guideline on the basis of the development costs involved."
"Many countries would like to cut down on public health spending by raising the patients' own contributions for medicines."
"This is unacceptable."
"Savings should, in fact, be sought in joint and improved negotiations with the industry instead of by increasing patients' own contributions."
"Secondly, legislation should not hamper, but rather promote, innovation."
"Industry wants to do this by extending the data protection period, but this is no guarantee for innovation."
"Quite the opposite, in fact; there is more innovation happening in the United States, which has a shorter period of protection."
"We must stimulate innovation by emphasising the therapeutic value-added and, above all, by displaying public leadership and by raising questions in the area of research ourselves."
"Agreements can be reached about the research agenda during the price negotiations."
"Good prices in exchange for investments in medicines for which there is a worldwide need are a step in the right direction."
"Thirdly, we must put provisions in place which enable the production of generic versions of essential medicines that are still patented but that are unaffordable in developing countries."
"This should only apply to medicines for countries that do not yet have the production capacity available themselves."
"Major steps were taken in Doha to make medicines more affordable in developing countries."
"All that remains for us to do is to make a small, yet important, step."
"Finally, we must single-mindedly uphold the ban on advertising medicines."
"Providing direct information or advertising that is aimed at patients is not the right way forward."
"The pharmaceutical industry is already spending huge amounts of money on marketing."
"Even more marketing will hike up the price of medicines unnecessarily."
"At least as important is the argument that we must prevent the industry from talking healthy people into illnesses."
"There are other ways of ensuring that good information is available to patients."
"I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to Mrs Grossetête and, above all, Mrs Müller for all her intricate work."
"All her efforts to make medicines more suitable for children and women receive my wholehearted support, as does her plea for a European approach, for which I should also like to express thanks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we all know from our own experience that there is really no such thing as an internal market in pharmaceutical products in the European Union."
"There are price differences of as much as 400% between Belgium and Germany, and you cannot simply explain that away by different VAT rates!"
"I am afraid that these reports concentrate too much on approval."
"I hope, however, that the transparency that we have flagged up here and that we are calling for will in future make it easier for consumers to understand why there are such great price differences between individual Member States."
"It is not acceptable for Europe's internal market so obviously not to include the pharmaceutical industry."
"I hope that by achieving transparency the links between public research and industrial research will also become clearer, and that databases will also make it easier to see who has been involved in given clinical tests and to what extent public research receives external funding."
"I too am pleased that we managed to leave advertising out of the equation, because that would have simply raised expectations on the part of patients that could not be met."
"We are talking about better and more favourable prices, not about more advertising."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I very much appreciate the fact that my colleague, Mrs Grossetête, has repeatedly highlighted considerations of public health and safety in her amendments."
"These are areas which, from the outset, medicinal products were intended to safeguard."
"These brief comments are not unnecessary."
"If, after all, medicinal products have, in many hands, become an end in themselves, and have gone against their original aim, Mrs Grossetête's approach is a welcome restoration of discipline."
"I genuinely hope that spirit will remain in this directive up until we have finally achieved a result."
"Furthermore, Amendment No 16 concerning the identification of the ingredients of generic drugs is in order, as that will promote a more judicious use of them, that is to say, generic substitution."
"It is a question of using medicinal products rationally and exploiting the price potential of medicines in official drug substitution systems after medicinal product patents expire."
"Patients' contributions also go down when they are put on medicines that are similar to, but cheaper than, the original ones."
"Promoting the use of generic drugs fully meets with the European Union's objectives in the areas of policy on medicinal products and public health."
"These objectives on the other hand include ensuring the supply of medicines that are new and regarded as important in terms of their therapeutic value to the patients that need them."
"These medicinal products are patent protected and in general expensive."
"Experience in my country, Finland, and in many others has shown that practice with regard to prescribing medicines does not move sufficiently in the direction of cheaper alternative medicinal products or alternative imported products unless there is guidance in the shape of government action, in other words, legislation."
"Such guidance comes in the form of inter alia reference price systems, doctors' own budgets for medicinal products, and generic substitution."
"In addition, I should like to thank those of my colleagues responsible for tabling Amendment Nos 95, which obliges manufacturers to guarantee an adequate supply of medicinal products to wholesalers."
"Restrictions on supplies, as practised by some manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, cause problems for wholesalers of medicinal products and, ultimately, the patient."
"Mr President, I have admiration for the accomplishment of scientific research in developing medicines which have proved of great benefit."
"Yet I also have a healthy scepticism towards both the pharmaceutical industry and our exaggerated confidence in some of its products, many of which cause a great deal more harm than the illegal recreational drugs which attract the bulk of public attention."
"For that reason, it would be wrong to place more unnecessary burdens and regulations upon food supplements and the health-food shops that sell them."
"Many believe these products to be beneficial, and at least they do not cause harm."
"I regard homeopathic medicines in the same way."
"Today we have more patients who are better informed than ever before - that is a good thing."
"I want people to have access to objective information about medicines and treatment."
"However, that is quite different from opening the door to the direct advertising of medicines."
"The result, I fear, will not be better public information, but greater public confusion, stimulated by the marketing techniques of a used-car salesman."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to compliment both rapporteurs on their excellent work."
"I believe that these proposals provide a good basis for ensuring that the internal market in medical products operates properly for medicines for both human and veterinary use."
"As far as I am concerned the hallmark of an internal market is not price stability, but comparable prices, which is something altogether different and really has nothing to do with the internal market."
"These proposals will also give a continuing boost to research, making research worthwhile again and also enabling manufacturers of generic drugs to make a living."
"I also believe that these proposals will make it possible to take advantage of all the options for maintaining public health."
"Harmonising data exclusivity in the European Union will particularly promote research, and at the same time make the task of generic drug manufacturers easier."
"I fully support this and those affected should not need to make any further demands."
"However, as I see it, extending the centralised authorisation procedure for medicinal products, as advocated by the Commission in committee, is not in accordance with the principles that have been mentioned."
"The present twofold authorisation procedure fully meets the requirements of the internal market and guarantees a greater variety of medicinal products, and with lower charges."
"The new plan to impose use of the centralised procedure for products with new active substances will undermine competition between the authorisation procedures."
"We can include as many processing deadlines as we like in the regulation, but without any competition these figures are meaningless."
"I know a great many SMEs that carry out research and in particular companies that are doing research and development in the field of 'orphan drugs' or veterinary medicines."
"That is where active substances of this kind are developed."
"Authorisation for these would have to be applied for in London, and I believe that these companies cannot afford that, nor can they put it into practice."
"So what we will end up achieving is to halt this kind of research, which really is not acceptable."
"We should therefore refuse to support the change proposed here."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for their work."
"As many colleagues have said, pharmaceutical products are like no other."
"We must guarantee that these products are all safe and effective."
"Therefore, on the debate on the centralised procedure, I believe we must have flexibility."
"We should not restrict choice but allow for choice and support flexibility between the two routes."
"On the renewal of authorisation, I oppose the Commission's proposal to remove five-year renewal of marketing authorisation and rely on enhanced pharmaco-vigilance to ensure product safety and, indeed, exclusivity."
"I think the compromise which has been reached is a fair one."
"I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment has rejected direct consumer advertising."
"We must be very clear that we all want patients to be informed."
"We all want patients to make informed decisions - no one can argue with this."
"But we cannot have what happens in the US, where the ten most advertised drugs are the ten best selling drugs."
"This is where the amendments adopted in committee requesting a report and the question of how information to patients is used and enhanced are so important."
"Information to patients from the industry varies from excellent approaches and partnership with patients to situations where some patient organisations are being accused of being mere fronts for the industry."
"We must get the balance right."
"We have an opportunity in the review to do this, to improve research, to secure jobs, to improve availability of products to patients and improve information given to patients."
"It is an exciting time, and I look forward to the review returning for second reading."
"Mr President, I agree with those who have said that public health protection is the most important objective, but that research also needs to be promoted."
"By means of the research incentives envisaged we will not only be making industry more competitive and thus safeguarding around 500 000 jobs in Europe, we will also be promoting the development of new medicinal products."
"The proposal for a regulation and the two directives before us do, however, at the same time demand that the pharmaceutical industry, in view of the almost ideal framework conditions - data exclusivity standards are nowhere else as high as in Europe - should demonstrate its capacity for innovation."
"Patients need innovative new medical products and not analogous products that burden our health systems without providing any extra benefit for patients."
"I believe that as the consultation procedure moves forward, Parliament should not lose sight of the triple objective of improving health protection, enhancing productivity and safeguarding jobs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I will focus once again on a number of what I feel to be key points."
"The Commission's proposal to allow a data protection period of ten years must, in my opinion, remain a solid, immovable pillar."
"This position is well-balanced and will provide European industry with new incentives and impetus to continue to invest new resources in the development of more effective, safer medicinal products and make them competitive at international level at last."
"I feel it is important to have a sufficiently long period of data protection for well-known medicinal products too, wherever there are new therapeutic indications."
"As I said before, I do not support the line taken regarding the membership of the management board, which I believe should be made up solely of institutional representatives."
"I therefore call upon you, Commissioner, and the Council to come up with a balanced model for a management board which can work calmly, free from dispute or conflict."
"I am amazed, reading Amendments Nos 153 and 154, for example, to see that the directive still mentions 'traditional herbal medicinal products'."
"I am the rapporteur of another report on traditional herbal medicinal products, and so I do not support Amendments Nos 153 and 154."
"However, Mr President, I am in favour of removing the requirement to re-license products every five years. This is an excessively bureaucratic burden."
"I hope that we will, at last, have a system of active pharmacovigilance operating throughout the territory which will allow us to introduce continuous monitoring carried out by highly qualified experts - Europe is teeming with clinical pharmacologists - to ensure that any toxic side effects are made known as soon as they occur."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like thank Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller for their very full reports."
"Tomorrow we will be voting on the most important revision package to date as regards legislation on medicinal products in the European Union."
"The key objectives here are as follows: first, achieving a high level of health protection and giving patients rapid access to innovative products; second, the quality, safety and effectiveness of medicinal products in Europe; and, third, further dismantling existing barriers to trade within the internal market."
"Medicinal products need to be used appropriately and correctly."
"That is why it is vital for the law to make a clear distinction between information and advertising."
"All product information should be scientifically checked before it is published."
"Provisions relating to medicinal products should only apply to products that have a therapeutic benefit and are used therapeutically."
"Any overlap with food law should be avoided in order to obviate legal uncertainty."
"For this reason a clear definition of medicinal products and food is urgently needed, as provided for in Amendments Nos 11 and 18."
"The achievements of industrial research as regards innovative therapeutic uses should be recognised by means of appropriate data exclusivity for what are termed 'original products'."
"I am, however, also supporting Amendment No 40, which grants existing medicinal products an additional three years' data exclusivity in the event of a new indication."
"Generic drugs, which must of course meet all requirements as regards quality, safety and effectiveness, should also be established in the European market and it should be possible to market them as soon as the period of protection for the original drug has expired."
"The authorisation procedure is to retain the option of choice between the centralised and decentralised procedures, which has existed since 1995."
"It has resulted in a marked increase in the efficiency of the authorisation procedures and has not led to the polarisation that some feared."
"It is essential that mutual recognition should continue for the sake of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We need to create a system that promotes innovation in the interests of all patients."
"Mr President, these reports deal with very important issues, and I compliment both rapporteurs."
"The whole debate on pharmaco-vigilance versus the compulsory five-year review, and the question of whether to centralise the registration procedure or keep the centralised, national and mutual recognition procedures is critical."
"With certain necessary changes, we have almost got it right."
"It is very important that all citizens have equal access to state-of-the-art drugs, regardless of where they live in Europe."
"It is either a single market or it is not."
"The same applies to Irish cattle."
"It is very important that they should have access to the same veterinary medicines as UK cattle, but at the moment they do not."
"We need to get the balance right with access to generic medicines and innovation and research and the needs of the pharmaceutical companies."
"This also applies to the Commission proposal on POM, prescription only medicines."
"I would ask the Commissioner to take on board the compromise suggested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which gets the balance right in this area, because the Commission proposal has caused major problems in many countries, particularly the UK and Ireland."
"The MRL regulation of 1990 came into force in 1992, and there was a derogation for many countries until 1 January 2000."
"This resulted in hundreds of veterinary medicine products being removed from the market and huge welfare problems in Europe for minor animal species - including horses - for many years."
"Industry needs to be allowed to place on the market equine veterinary products that do not have MRLs, to be used according to the cascade principle, with a record of treatment and exclusion from the food chain."
"Amendment No 65 is necessary, as it ties this principle, which was endorsed by the Committee on the Environment's Amendment No 10, to the passport decision 2000/68/EEC, which amends Decision 93/623/EEC."
"I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to look particularly at the passport decision 2000/68/EEC."
"We must be consistent here."
"As well as listening to the able people in the DG, please listen to the veterinary experts in the field and in research."
"No consumer wants to inflict unnecessary pain and suffering on animals for the sake of the food chain, or make criminals of our vets."
"We have made mistakes here before."
"Please be careful."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I basically support the Commission proposal and the reports by Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller."
"However, there are a few points on which I differ."
"One point was not mentioned in the debate at all, although I believe it to be very important: the Commission has proposed that prescriptions would also be required for medicinal products under the decentralised procedure."
"I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater."
"I think we need to be careful about ending up in a situation where all medical products that are at present available over the counter require prescriptions, because that would certainly create problems for consumers and would impose unreasonable costs on the health system."
"I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 151, which I have tabled jointly with several of my colleagues."
"The second important point has already been mentioned many times, but we cannot consider it often enough."
"We need to come to an arrangement that is acceptable for small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies."
"We cannot adopt legislation that, ultimately, only global players like Pfizer can comply with."
"We need rules that are appropriate for SMEs."
"In this connection there are a number of important issues, such as the amendment tabled by Mr Nisticò."
"Three years' data exclusivity in the event of a new indication is something that SMEs are perhaps in a better position to implement than data exclusivity for a totally new substance."
"In committee, I spoke against the pilot project on information and advertising, as I simply cannot understand why the information provided should be extended for three special indications but with far tighter rules in other areas."
"We need information for all indications and all diseases, and advertising for prescription medicines should be totally ruled out."
"That is why I agree with the conclusion reached by the committee."
"However, the committee overshot the mark on a couple of points, so that information that the pharmaceutical industry is allowed to provide now would in future no longer be permissible."
"We need to sort that out in tomorrow's vote."
"In conclusion I wish to call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal on medical product safety for children as soon as possible."
"I know that the Commission officials here today and the Commissioner himself regard this as a very important subject, but we have already been waiting too long for a definite legislative proposal."
"I urge you to present one before the year is out."
"Mr President, today's debate has been very instructive and shows the great commitment of many honourable Members of this House to these issues."
"A number of interesting issues have been raised."
"I want to tackle those raised by Members who are still here in the Chamber."
"It is unfortunate that often Members have disappeared when it is time for me to reply - I hope this is not an improper comment."
"I will comment on six groups of amendments."
"Firstly, on the extension of the scope of the centralised procedure."
"Mrs Grossetête put the whole case very well."
"The whole idea behind this procedure is to guarantee that goods are delivered quickly, equitably and in the interest of all patients in Europe."
"If we do not have a centralised procedure by the time the ten new Member States join, there will be enormous inequality."
"We take the comment on the SMEs very seriously and, for that reason, we are ready to seek concrete measures that would alleviate the burden on SMEs, for instance, a reduction in fees, direct scientific advice from the agency in London or administrative support."
"The Commission is also convinced that extended scope for the centralised procedure for human and veterinary medicine would benefit European citizens and businesses alike."
"For that reason, the Commission cannot accept amendments which reduce the scope of the centralised procedure."
"The second question is the balance between innovation and competition from generics."
"That is a very sensitive issue."
"I would be happy to discuss that in depth."
"In regard to the American system, as Mrs Corbey mentioned, we must remember that we cannot take just one point of comparison."
"In America, the drugs market is totally deregulated and there is direct consumer advertising."
"We are not proposing that."
"It is through data protection that we are trying to strike a balance."
"We are proposing something that the Commission refused to propose for years - namely the Bola system for generics which, of course, means more competition in the sector after the expiry of a patent and, at the same time, lower prices and lost revenue for those who originated the medicine."
"It is clearly better for the consumer."
"It is extremely important that we stick to that."
"Secondly, at the same time, to counterbalance it, we want to propose a solution for exclusivity involving a ten-year period and, if there are indications needing to be researched into later, ten plus one."
"I do not believe that European industries have been losing market share, that there are less innovative medicines and research in this field, and that this is in the interests of European patients."
"I just do not believe it."
"I am sure that we must try to accept that there are two or three public goods we can defend at the same time."
"Public health takes top priority but we must also support research innovation in Europe."
"If we do not support it we are going to be in permanent decline in all sectors."
"Research-intensive areas are those which create jobs, development and wealth and make it possible to assume our global responsibilities."
"So both are issues we must try to tackle at the same time."
"The balance is not always easy."
"We have done this after very careful consideration."
"There are a few amendments seeking to change this and we will oppose them."
"For instance, Amendment No 34 wants to go further in favour of generics and weaken the position of innovation."
"To keep the balance, we cannot support it."
"On the other hand, Amendments Nos 40 and 92 call for additional data protection of three years in two situations."
"Firstly, when a new indication is developed for an old medicine, and secondly, when a company submits documentation for switching a product from prescription to non-prescription status."
"These amendments must be seen in the whole context of the data-protection scheme."
"As regards the additional data protection on switching, we agree that this request is not unjustified."
"This could increase the availability of over-the-counter medicines."
"We can therefore accept Amendment No 92 in principle, but we still retain our right to look at the duration of that additional protection."
"As far as the additional data protection for old products is concerned, this entails a proposal that could extend data protection far beyond ten years - up to 14 years, to be precise."
"That is why we cannot support Amendment No 40."
"The third issue concerns improving information for patients."
"I feel a little uncomfortable with this debate because I am also against the proposal that many Members oppose, namely the American model."
"For instance, one Member said that in America the ten most used pharmaceuticals are the ones that are the most advertised."
"Among the five most advertised medicines at least, no one would have a right to take part in even the pilot project."
"A pilot project does not mean direct advertising."
"It is only information validated by the competent authorities which can be given at the request of the patient or patients' organisations."
"It is right that people are against the American direct-to-consumer advertising."
"That is not what we are proposing."
"We have a situation where abundant information is available on the web, which is not validated and makes the consumer extremely unsure, which concentrates on products which are not on the market and which confuses many citizens when they visit their doctors."
"Because we cannot stop it, we want to offer the possibility of access to information validated by clear guidelines, accepted by the Community and monitored, observed and controlled by the Medicines Evaluation agency."
"I understand that people are against the American system, but we have never proposed it."
"That is why we cannot support Amendment No 101 and others aiming at the same objective."
"The fourth issue concerns relative effectiveness."
"Some amendments relate to relative effectiveness."
"They suggest that the added therapeutic value should be considered as a criterion for the authorisation of a medicinal product - alongside quality, safety and efficacy."
"The Commission agrees that the issue of relative effectiveness is of great importance because it can help the kind of innovation that brings important benefits to patients."
"An authorisation depends on a positive benefit/risk ratio, on the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine itself, on its own merit."
"Relative effectiveness is not a reason to deny access to the market."
"The Commission can support the idea that relative effectiveness should be considered at EU level, and can accept in principle some related amendments, like Amendments Nos 4 and 100."
"The Commission cannot, however, accept amendments that establish relative effectiveness as a fourth hurdle for marketing authorisation."
"The fifth group of amendments concerns legal status."
"The Commission proposes that the conditions of supply - over-the-counter or prescription-only - should be determined under the mutual recognition procedure."
"This would obviously lead to a harmonised EU legal status for all products authorised accordingly."
"The Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate to include legal status in the mutual recognition procedure."
"But the Commission understands the concerns that this might lead to a situation where too many products are classified as prescription-only medicines because of a 'lowest common denominator' effect among the Member States."
"Finally, on the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, our proposal follows the lines which were provided for the European Food Safety Authority at the time of our proposal."
"Amendment No 16 aligns the EMEA Management Board with the model finally adopted for the Food Safety Authority, and the Commission can support this amendment."
"Finally, let me just briefly reiterate that Parliament is provided in writing with a full list of the Commission's positions on each of the amendments"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"WRITTEN STATEMENT (RULE 120)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0327/2002) by Mrs Evans, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the animal-health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals."
"Mr President, the aim of this regulation is to ensure consistency in the rules for travelling with pet animals, commonly known as the pet passport scheme."
"It is a very welcome development and very important to the lives of many EU citizens who have, in the past, been prevented from travelling because they could not take their pet animals with them."
"The fact that the Commission has been able to bring forward such a proposal reflects the incredible success of the steps taken over recent years to control rabies."
"It is worth repeating the figures: cases among cats and dogs have fallen from nearly 500 in 1991 to just 5 in 1998."
"As the Member States started to adopt their own rules for the increased movement of pet animals, it became clear that a European system was needed to make it easier for pet owners and avoid confusion."
"I am pleased that Parliament's amendments, adopted in the common position, called for detailed information for consumers so that they can make the necessary preparations before travelling."
"I would like to draw attention to some of the key issues."
"First, the legal base."
"Members will recall that this was one of the main issues at first reading."
"The Commission proposed a double legal base, whereas Parliament's view was that, since the main aim of this regulation was to protect public health, a single legal base should apply."
"However, following the receipt of the common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has accepted the double legal base."
"Secondly, trade."
"Once the Council has included measures on trade within the regulation, as requested by Parliament, the distinction between commercial and non-commercial movement is still not defined clearly enough."
"Under the Council proposal, the maximum number of five animals that can be moved under this regulation is fine."
"But if the purpose of the regulation is primarily to protect public health, then the number of animals being transported is not relevant."
"We have therefore tabled amendments deleting the maximum number."
"Thirdly, identification."
"Parliament previously called for ISO standard transponders to be used and for the owner's name and address to be included."
"The Commission and the Council proposals allowed for other types of transponders to be used, as long as the owner carried the means to read the information."
"As ISO chips are not available in all countries, the Committee on the Environment has agreed to remove the requirement for ISO standard equipment, but still wants the owner's details to be included. This would help combat trafficking in pet animals."
"We strongly believe that electronic identification is more effective, humane and reliable than tattoos and that, after the transitional eight-year period, only microchips would be acceptable."
"The fourth point relates to young animals."
"The Committee has re-tabled the amendments preventing the movement of animals under three months old without the requirements of this scheme."
"This would not be applicable to the United Kingdom, Ireland or Sweden, but it would apply to the other Member States."
"I do not believe that it is possible for the authorities to carry out proper checks on young animals, for instance ensuring that they have remained at the place of birth or have not had any contact with wild animals."
"This therefore leaves a loophole for trade in puppies and kittens particularly."
"The fifth point concerns the involvement of Parliament."
"Several of our amendments relate to Parliament's involvement in decisions such as the extension of the transitional measures for the three sensitive Member States and to comitology -retaining Parliament's right to be consulted."
"Finally, the OIE International Animal Health Code."
"The committee has retained the requirement to take into account the OIE Code when deciding on the health status of third countries in the scheme."
"This has been a subject of some debate."
"I am aware that the Council felt that the OIE Code would exclude large parts of the EU from free movement of animals, especially after enlargement."
"I also know that countries such as the United Kingdom are moving away from rabies-free status because it would exclude, for example, Canada and the USA, but the committee has decided to adopt a cautious approach."
"I believe that each of these issues can be resolved without too much difficulty and I ask Parliament to support the position of the Committee on the Environment."
"I must say that I am disappointed that, despite my best efforts, an agreement could not be reached with the Council before the second reading and I am very grateful to the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups, the representatives of the presidency and the Commission for their cooperation in our discussions over the past three weeks."
"I believe that Parliament has taken a very constructive approach and we will continue to do so in order to reach agreement as soon as possible."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Evans, and the Committee on the Environment, for the report on the Council's common position."
"I am satisfied that the report reflects a general agreement on the safety of the technical provisions relating to the management of the rabies risk, even if a few points of disagreement remain and may need some further clarification."
"The main differences between the original proposal submitted to Parliament at first reading and the common position we have before us today fall into three categories."
"First, we have the provision facilitating movements of young animals between Member States of equivalent status."
"Second, the provisions for reassessment within a period of five years of the specific conditions for movements to Ireland, the United Kingdom and Sweden."
"Third, provisions amending the conditions applying to trade to align them with the conditions applying to non-commercial movements - to accommodate the wish expressed by Parliament at first reading."
"Allow me now to address in detail the amendments proposed in the report."
"They can be split into two categories - technical amendments and institutional amendments."
"I will begin with the nine technical amendments."
"Amendments Nos 1 and 6 may be the result of a misunderstanding."
"The setting of a maximum number of animals aims only to distinguish commercial movements from other non-commercial movements."
"It is not intended to be a dividing line between two different types of rules - the same rules would apply to commercial and non-commercial movements."
"So it would be incorrect to say that setting a maximum of, say, five would be any threat to public health."
"In effect, it means that once you go above five, the commercial rules apply but below five the rules set out in this draft legislation apply."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 4 would result in a prohibition of movements of young animals under the age of vaccination between Member States other than the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden, for which specific provisions exist."
"The conclusion of the discussion with the Council was that those movements of young animals have always been allowed, that they represent a negligible risk and that this flexibility must be maintained."
"Otherwise, the movement of these animals would be seriously undermined."
"Therefore, Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 cannot be accepted."
"Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 suggest the adoption of import conditions equivalent to those that apply to movements inside the Community for third countries free of rabies as defined in the OIE Code."
"As already stated at first reading, this is not in line with the risk analysis approach that we need to adopt, so these amendments cannot be accepted."
"In fact, this would not be consistent with the conditions applicable to movements inside the Union, as some Member States are not 'rabies free' under the OIE Code definition, even if rabies in domestic animals is under control on their territory, as Ms Evans mentioned."
"We therefore need to take a similar approach to third countries with similar circumstances."
"Finally, on the technical amendments, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 and 13."
"Almost all Member States consider microchipping to be a reliable method of identification, and I look favourably on automatic harmonisation after a transitional period of eight years."
"Let me now turn to the seven institutional amendments."
"In a spirit of compromise, the Commission could consider favourably Amendment No 5, which aims to introduce a codecision procedure for the extension of specific provisions applicable to the UK, Ireland and Sweden."
"The Commission could also have accepted Amendment No 16 as an alternative to Amendment No 12, and I regret therefore that Amendment No 16 has been withdrawn."
"Amendment No 12 unreasonably deprives the Commission of any possibility to propose temporary measures, whereas Amendment No 16 would have allowed this in a reasonable way."
"I cannot therefore accept Amendment No 12."
"Nor can I accept the other four amendments."
"Amendments Nos 10 and 11 would limit the executive competence of the Commission to 'technical' aspects."
"This wording would very likely give rise to legal arguments on the interpretation of the word 'technical', which is not defined in the legislation."
"This would jeopardise the sound management and efficient implementation of the regulation."
"Amendments Nos 14 and 15 cannot be accepted because they go beyond the institutional agreement."
"I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that they are not consistent with the dual legal base of the regulation."
"I hope I have adequately explained the reasoning behind the positions I have taken on the amendments."
"Mr President, provisions for animal health when transporting pets are particularly important for Member States which are currently entirely free of rabies."
"In spite of this, I believe that it is vital for moves and travel across borders within the EU to be made easier for families and individuals who are travelling with a pet."
"I am pleased that the Council's proposal has taken into account the views put forward in Parliament's first consideration of the matter."
"I find it incomprehensible that there are currently different provisions relating to animal health when transporting pets for commercial purposes in the EU."
"The risk of rabies infection cannot be significantly different simply because the purpose of the pet's journey is different."
"Therefore, it is necessary to adapt the health rules for transporting pets for commercial purposes to this directive."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Evans for her excellent work on this issue."
"Mr President, this measure is of great significance in those countries - the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden - which are now bringing their rules on the movement of pet animals into line with practices elsewhere in the Community."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe it is a pity that we could not reach agreement before the conciliation stage, but I understand the differences."
"Some of those differences will be reflected in this debate, and I still have some minor differences with the rapporteur, which she has already acknowledged."
"For those countries which have prevented the entry of animals that may be at risk of rabies without a long period of quarantine, this is, in a way, an act of faith."
"It is made possible by the fact that we now have effective vaccination methods which can be indicated by the transponder chip."
"We have recently had representations from some members of the veterinary profession arguing for an extension of the tattooing principle and claiming that the transponder chip can be surgically removed or otherwise nullified."
"I cannot accept those arguments."
"There is broad agreement between the Commission and all Members of this House that we should move toward alignment."
"I share the rapporteur's concern that the movement of young animals, which must present at least some element of risk, should be subject to the same constraints as that of other categories."
"I have not been able to follow the arguments against that, other than that it may, somewhere along the line, affect the trade in animals."
"But, as the Commissioner well knows, trade in animals, if it is not effectively handled, has led to the perpetuation of some serious abuses in the Community in recent years."
"I do not believe this is a persuasive argument."
"I agree, however, with the Commission and not the rapporteur on Amendments Nos 7, 8, and 9."
"It is counterproductive to introduce amendments which will effectively constrain the movement of animals between some existing Member States, as well as extending the scheme - as the United Kingdom and other countries with the current constraints would like - to countries that are not rabies-free."
"For the United States and Canada, for example, we see no reason why there should be the further impediments set out in Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9."
"We agree with the rapporteur, however, on the question of comitology."
"I welcome the Commissioner's assurance that a suitable amendment allowing for reference to Parliament at any process of review will be introduced."
"In conclusion, although this is a small measure to many and will not mean much to those countries where animals routinely cross internal EU borders, for those who cherish pets as lifelong companions it is a measure that will be greatly welcomed."
"I am happy to inform you that a delegation from the Senate of Puerto Rico have taken their seats in the visitors' gallery."
"The delegation is headed by Mr Antonio Fas Alzamora, the President of the Senate of Puerto Rico, and is made up of three members of the Senate."
"President Fas Alzamora, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to you and your delegation."
"I have been informed that you are going to have a number of important meetings with Members of Parliament here in Strasbourg."
"On behalf of the entire Parliament, I wish you a very enjoyable visit."
"Thank you for coming to visit Parliament."
"President."
"Voting time is now suspended."
"It will be resumed after the formal sitting."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.56 a.m. and resumed at 12.36 a.m.)"
"We had no objection to voting in favour of the report (which concerns Portugal), but would like to take this opportunity of pointing out that Greece has been outrageously wronged in the distribution of milk quotas and the Commission should quickly table a proposal righting that wrong by doubling Greece's quota for cow's milk."
"The production quota of around 700 000 tonnes set for Greece does not even meet domestic demand, which totals over 1 100 000 tonnes and, when it is exceeded, it costs livestock farmers a fortune in co-responsibility levies."
"At the same time, certain dairy companies are known to have made a killing by raking in huge profits at the expense of livestock farmers - who are forced to supply their milk at ever lower prices - and increasing the price of products to the consumer."
"Livestock farming in Greece is on death row and Greek consumers are forced to buy imported long-life products because it takes too long to get fresh milk to Greece from the Member States of the EU; and yet Greece has the potential to increase its output to meet the demand for fresh milk."
"We are calling for a fair distribution of quotas based on population figures, consumer demand and production potential."
"The Fiori Report has not received my support."
"I have abstained for two reasons."
"First of all, it is unwise to reduce the excise duty on biofuels before we have a complete picture of the environmental impact of the introduction of these fuels on road transportation."
"Moreover, several statements have been made about tax policy, an outstanding example of a policy that should take shape close to the people, that is to say in the Member States."
"A European initiative can only be justified in the event of demonstrable harmful competitive distortion."
"Secondly, I object to LPG being classified as an alternative fuel."
"It is, after all, a petroleum product."
"Although fewer polluting substances are released as a whole during combustion, there is no doubt that harmful substances are emitted."
"An alternative fuel is fundamentally different from the so-called traditional fuels because it is both a renewable and emission-free source of energy."
"As such, LPG certainly cannot be labelled an alternative fuel."
"In conclusion, these two elements have prevented me from supporting the report."
"I certainly welcome a shift to fuels that are less environmentally harmful, but not in the way proposed in the report."
"At the Johannesburg Summit a 15% increase in the production of alternative energy sources by 2010 was proposed."
"Increasing the productivity of renewables is the only long-term alternative to traditional energy sources."
"Research and development need to be stepped up with a view to achieving this."
"The positive effects flowing from this are self-evident."
"Research creates jobs; increased use of biofuels provides an additional product alternative for the agricultural sector; and, last but not least, negative environmental impacts are reduced."
"For all these reasons we have voted for the Fiori Report."
"Mr President, Mrs Evans' document concerns the movement of pet animals."
"The report appears to represent progress for the free movement of pet animals in Europe too."
"Indeed, the report lists dogs, cats, ornamental tropical fish, amphibia, reptiles, birds and mammals."
"Yes, you did hear me say ornamental tropical fish, amongst other things. As you know, Mr President, I have a direct line to the fish."
"The sardines in the sea complained: 'We too have free movement, but only to end up in restaurant kitchens, to be thrown straight into the frying pan, while ornamental tropical fish can just enjoy themselves swimming round tanks thanks to your directive."
"Why is it that you at the European Parliament do not do something to allow us too to become pensioner fish at last rather than persisting in wanting to fry us for your dinner?'"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to speak not about fish and frying pans, like Mr Fatuzzo, but about a very serious issue in connection with the Lambert Report."
"The SPD Members of this Parliament have voted for this report although we can understand the difficulty that a number of our fellow Members had in supporting it."
"I would like to mention one key point that persuaded us to give this report our support, although we would have liked it to be structured differently."
"I have in mind here the fact that Mrs Lambert's directive makes no legal distinction between refugees, that is people who are victims of political persecution, and people who require the European Union to offer them temporary protection."
"When the question is what care and benefits these groups of persons should receive in the EU Member States, this is quite justifiable."
"Indeed, we do not want people who have fled from a country to be treated differently."
"What is, however, at stake here is that a qualifying distinction needs to be drawn between someone who is a victim of political persecution, such as a member of a resistance movement against a dictatorship who goes into exile and needs protection, and on the other hand people fleeing from a temporary situation such as, for example, a civil war, who therefore only need temporary protection, or, as defined in the Geneva convention on refugees, subsidiary protection."
"Mrs Lambert's directive covers all these groups of persons."
"Our view is that a distinction ought to have been made."
"We also make this distinction in German constitutional law as a matter of principle, because Article 16 of the German constitution defines a legally obtainable right to protection against political persecution, but not a legally obtainable right to subsidiary protection."
"We German Social Democrats have therefore voted in favour of this report despite all these misgivings, partly because it would not have got through otherwise and this House cannot fail to deliver an opinion when consulted by the Council."
"Mr President, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I voted for this proposal for a directive because, like many of the Members, I feel that our States have a duty to receive refugees and to do so properly."
"I would stress, Mr President, that, as I see it, it is important to address the issue of where the refugees should be received and which States should pay for this when - as, I am afraid to say, sometimes happens - large numbers of citizens of other States flee to our European States."
"The burden of receiving refugees should be spread equally among all our States of Europe."
"The Moderate Party delegation to the European Parliament has today voted in favour of the Council directive on minimum standards for when citizens of third countries and stateless persons will be considered refugees or as persons who, for other reasons, require international protection and on the legal status of these persons."
"However, we have voted against Parliament's amended proposal."
"We believe in the clear right of refugees to find sanctuary from persecution and other oppression by entering the EU."
"Establishing minimum standards is an important first step on the road towards a common asylum policy in the EU."
"However, it is important to emphasise that, over and above the minimum standards proposed by the EU, it should be possible for Member States to provide people with protection for other reasons."
"Transparency must lie at the heart of creating a common stance within the EU on immigration and migration."
"Designing an immigration policy, in other words rules for being able to move to a country, is always a balancing act."
"Open borders could easily lead to us closing the door on dynamism and improvements."
"Immigration is an asset."
"The opportunity for foreign citizens who are not refugees to immigrate to Europe as migrant workers should be expanded."
"- (DA) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Lambert's report because, in many areas, it improves upon the minimum standards that, under the auspices of the EU, an attempt is now unfortunately being made to establish when it comes to refugees and persons with subsidiary refugee status."
"The report seeks to broaden the range of people to whom the standards would apply and to improve conditions and rights."
"For example, the Commission's proposal relates exclusively to third country nationals and stateless persons, while EU citizens are not covered by it."
"The report attempts to correct this state of affairs, for it would be an odd and dangerous signal to send to the international community that the EU countries, which have each individually signed the Geneva Convention, are able to decide mutually to exempt themselves from the scope of the international agreement, believing as they do that the Convention cannot be applied to their own citizens."
"Moreover, the Commission proposes that persons with refugee status must have more extensive rights."
"That is naturally a good thing, but it should also apply to persons with subsidiary refugee status, as recommended by the rapporteur."
"The June Movement is in favour of a humane refugee policy. We support every human being's right to a life of dignity, but we believe as a matter of principle that this aim is not best served by developing a common European refugee policy based on the supranational first pillar of which the proposal in the report is a part."
"I wish to place on the record the fact that I did not participate in the vote on the Lambert report (A5-0333/02)."
"My non-participation should not be seen as opposition to the principle of the proposed directive but rather to the inclusion of certain elements in the report which I feel are inappropriate and would lead to a diminution of the underlying beliefs in the protection of those most in need of our support."
"The following are some of the different elements with which I disagree."
"The definition of the family goes far beyond the accepted norm in most Member States and other countries; this issue should have been addressed more sensitively and the report fails badly in this respect."
"The deadlines set under various articles are too short."
"The reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights is used inappropriately in the report."
"Extending the scope of the directive beyond those who are suffering persecution will ultimately reduce the legitimate opportunity for protecting those in greatest need."
"For these and other reasons I felt it inappropriate to participate in the vote."
"British Labour members of the PES have voted in support of the Lambert report."
"We are convinced that the way forward for the European Union is to move towards a common EU policy on asylum."
"This report on minimum standards is one important part of the evolution of this common policy."
"We reject the hard right-wing view of those conservatives in the EPP who seek to restrict the right to asylum and protection."
"As socialists, we believe that it is essential to be compassionate and sympathetic in our approach."
"In working towards a common policy for fifteen countries and ultimately twenty-five, there will always be some variations in detail."
"We believe these differences should not be used to divide us in our efforts to find compromises, instead we should be proud enough to build on the common ground that unites us."
"Therefore, whilst there are some aspects of the Lambert report which we as Labour MEPs might question, the overall direction of the report is undoubtedly sound, hence our vote in favour."
"Europe is one of the world's most prosperous, democratic and stable continents."
"It therefore comes as no surprise that many people who are persecuted, threatened or harassed in other countries seek refuge over here."
"With them come others who are not being persecuted but who are attracted by the level of prosperity in Europe."
"If these people have been trained in a specialist field in which there is a shortage of manpower over here, they are even actively recruited, often at the expense of facilities in their countries of origin."
"Real refugees, on the other hand, are increasingly less welcome."
"Some EU Member State governments are now considering nothing but the numbers."
"Restricting the number of refugees, therefore, is seen as preferable to a sound assessment of the reasons why people flee and the extent to which they are in danger."
"It is time we stopped this practice and took the need of the refugees themselves as a guiding principle."
"We should stop extraditing people to states that are unsafe for them, refusing to reunite families or refusing to recognise persecution on the basis of intolerance or sex discrimination."
"On 24 September, the Evans Report on asylum and security was a step in the right direction, even though my group took the view that these proposals did not go far enough."
"These proposals, however, ultimately attracted more no-votes than yes-votes."
"The European Parliament's contribution would be very useful and positive, if, whilst maintaining the scope and the limits of the proposals for a directive, it contributed to the legal clarification of concepts that could raise doubts or controversy in the transposition of the future directive and in its implementation."
"Unfortunately, however, the rapporteur and the majority of the specialised Parliamentary committee have not given this clarification and have instead taken the matter, in a way that is inexplicable in the context of a minimum common status for all Member States, along a route of successive extensions to the legislative provision, which, in a counterproductive way, can only create more difficulties and new obstacles that are unnecessary for its adoption."
"Hence our votes on the specific issues and in the final vote: most of the amendments tabled have not been useful and, on the contrary, frequently go beyond what is necessary and reasonable when it comes to setting minimum standards for all Member States."
"Nevertheless, I am in favour of the original initiative received in Parliament, because, in line with the Tampere European Council, we advocate the approximation of rules in the field of refugee status, and of other subsidiary measures, with regard to those persons who, although denied the aforementioned refugee status, are in need of identical protection."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mrs Lambert's report (A5 - 0333/2002)."
"We agree that the EU should lay down minimum standards for the recognition of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection."
"We are nonetheless aware of the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark's position."
"Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld's report, which we have just adopted in this Chamber, concerns a Council framework decision seeking to protect us from what is known as hacking into information systems."
"When my friend, Mr Maurizio Infissi from Capriate San Gervasio - a beautiful place near Bergamo - who, although a pensioner, is a computer expert, heard that we were going to discuss this matter, he said: 'You are doing the right thing in protecting yourselves against hacking into information systems, but would it not be a good idea to protect pensioners too against the attacks of governments, Prime Ministers and Budget Ministers, who sometimes carry out violent attacks on our incomes, providing pensions which are all too often miserly and prevent us from living dignified lives?"
"When will you adopt measures and hold debates to protect pensioners against attacks by the state?'"
"'I am sure it will be soon,' I replied, and I certainly hope so, Mr President!"
". (PT) The report voted on in Parliament improves the text proposed by the Commission, by increasing references to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as privacy."
"In some aspects, however, it upholds the line taken by the Commission, as well as suggesting the communitarisation of policies."
"It should be noted that the Commission proposal falls in line with the approach of taking advantage of the events of 11 September 2001 by restricting certain fundamental rights, which has not led to much protest, specifically rights pertaining to the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Furthermore, the Commission proposal betrays an obsession with regulation, an attempt to harmonise criminal law and a suppressive rather than preventive viewpoint, with which we cannot agree."
"Hence our vote against the report."
"People can become involved in computer hacking for very different reasons."
"It is not simply a question of resourceful young people exploring the possibilities technology has to offer, or of 'nerds' who enjoy wreaking havoc in other people's work; it is also about critical investigators who are looking for information that is important to many but that is kept secret unfairly."
"The latter group helps reduce opportunities for environmental scandals, corruption, financial fraud, warmongering and dictatorial acts."
"In all cases, incidents of computer hacking interfere with the smooth operation of organisations in both the private and public sector, but when these incidents are assessed, what ultimately counts is the positive or negative impact these disruptive activities have."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, that this framework decision and the relevant national implementing measures should not be used to suppress freedom of expression, demonstration and association."
"Minor disruptions that are viewed as unimportant in the individual Member States need not be made punishable by the EU."
"The application of Article 12, in which contact points are set up for the mutual exchange of experiences, can also have adverse effects."
"I therefore support the proposal to postpone this section."
". (PT) I have supported this report because it highlights our awareness of the importance of fighting computer crime and because it demonstrates essential concerns about limiting criminal, preventive and punitive action in a way that respects the freedoms of opinion and of association and the freedom to demonstrate."
"I have also supported two other proposals by the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld: the first is her call for the EU to ensure, whenever it addresses issues concerning the transmission of information, that corresponding provisions exist in the field of data protection, in order to deal with the risks associated with their transmission; the second is her less severe evaluation in the case of the first offence of illegal access by a minor."
"In short, I think that Parliament has contributed to improving the proposal for a framework decision intended to provide a response to cybercrime by seeking to approximate the legal provisions of the Member States in order to guarantee that all attacks against information systems become a criminal offence and by promoting police and judicial cooperation."
"Lastly, I believe that the creation of a network of contact points that can be consulted around the clock in the fight against crime that uses these highly advanced technologies is extremely important."
"Mr President, the report concerns the importance and dynamics of the theatre and the performing arts in an enlarged Europe."
"I have had another dream, Mr President: I dreamt I was watching a play in which the enlarged Europe was taking part."
"What did I see in this play? I saw yours truly having lunch in a restaurant in a place called Vercelli in Italy with Mr Mádl, whom we applauded just now, and the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, the former King Simeon II."
"We were savouring saffron risotto, mushroom risotto and black risotto with cuttlefish, as is appropriate in a place such as Vercelli where rice is grown."
"We were all thoroughly enjoying our meal, but the chef said to us: 'Soon, you will no longer be able to enjoy rice if you Members of the European Parliament do not do something to help agriculture in the reform of the common agricultural policy that is currently being carried out in the European Parliament and the European Community, for the agricultural activities of rice-growing areas such as Vercelli, Novara, Pavia, Milan and other areas of Europe must be safeguarded too.'"
"Our position on culture depends on the type of policy it promotes and the values, principles and aesthetic standards it puts forward."
"The prime question is whether cultural activities function for the benefit of the workers and contribute to social progress or whether they function for the benefit of big business, extending its control and increasing its profits."
"The report expresses the need for cultural processes relating to the performing arts to be incorporated - ideologically, politically and socially - into EU policy."
"It wants the theatre to serve the 'European ideal' and to apply policies such as mobility and lifelong learning."
"And it targets Mediterranean countries and the Central and Eastern European countries in particular."
"What, however, is this 'ideal' we are being called on to support?"
"If it is not clear, how can we be expected to aid and abet contradictory procedures, which resolve a few temporary problems (intellectual property rights, movement, education), but which also expose the fact that these problems were caused by the intervention of big business in each country's culture?"
"Similarly, we disagree with the dominant role of private companies and patrons and with the hazy outline of the nascent 'European cultural identity' and the methods being developed to impose it."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from voting."
"We have abstained from voting on Mrs Fraisse's report on the importance and dynamics of the theatre and the performing arts in an enlarged Europe."
"We have a positive basic attitude to the European Union."
"As Swedish liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to solve cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management."
"Here the democracies of Europe have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity."
"We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, that is that a decision should be taken as close to those whom it concerns as possible."
"This is why we actively promote the issue of a constitution for the European Union which makes the division of responsibility clear for everyone."
"It must be clear to all citizens that the EU will only tackle issues about which it is most expert, that is cross-border issues."
"All other issues should be handled at local, regional or national level."
"Theatre and dramatic art are important and we support people's opportunity for increased freedom of movement."
"We wish to make it easier for foreign workers to get visas and residence permits, but we believe that all occupational groups should be allowed to move across borders on the same terms."
"The proposals should not just apply to actors and dramatic artists but to all occupational groups."
"We also support cultural diversity, aid for artistic creativity, artistic freedom and access to culture for all our citizens, but we do not believe that they should be enshrined in any future European constitution."
"We wholeheartedly support several of the ideas presented in Mrs Fraisse's report at national level."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, which seeks to draw attention to the effective promotion of the conditions needed to ensure that the performing arts have, on the one hand, an increasingly large audience and, on the other, are continually more attractive and accessible, specifically through the promotion and protection of the mobility of artists and their work, of support for translation and subtitling as a tool for harmonisation and mutual cultural comprehension and of incentives for training and for dissemination actions."
"The protection of the performing arts is also a prerequisite if we are to ensure the preservation of the values of cultural diversity that characterises the European spirit, and so I agree with the importance that the rapporteur attaches to taking a close look at the performing arts in countries preparing to join the EU - a decisive element in the construction of a Europe based on the sharing of values and whose greatest asset is its diversity."
"Lastly, to follow this train of thought, I think that we must attach particular value to private initiatives - because these are the spontaneous expression of the Community's cultural heartbeat - instead of devoting our energies to direct action by the State or by public authorities."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Mr President, let me start by thanking my colleagues, particularly those on the Committee on Budgets, and the Committee on Budgets' secretariat."
"They have done a fantastic job with this budget and I think this is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to the incredibly hard work carried out by staff in this context."
"I would also like to thank the Commission and the Council, who through a long line of trialogues, conciliation, working groups and other contacts have helped to ensure that we now have a good draft budget for 2003 to vote on."
"I would also like to emphasise that on the vast majority of points we in the Committee on Budgets have reached broad agreement, which is naturally also an enormous strength for Parliament."
"I would like to begin with some fundamental reflections on the EU's budgetary system."
"I have to say that after having worked on this budget for approximately ten months, I am of the firm opinion that the EU's budgetary system is in great need of major reform."
"We will gain a number of improvements in the form of the new Financial Regulation."
"There will also be a number of improvements in the form of the ABB system, the system of activity-based budgeting."
"We have been able to tackle a number of points ourselves by improving the internal work of Parliament itself."
"I have put a great deal of effort into obtaining a better dialogue with the committees."
"Now, dialogue between, on the one hand, the Committee on Budgets and, on the other hand, the committees and their rapporteurs for the budget takes place as a practically permanent process, beginning with the guidelines in the spring, including the new work carried out this year with special working groups to monitor this year's budget and extending to the amendments ahead of the first reading."
"I therefore believe that we have reduced the traditional conflict where the various committees do not think that the Committee on Budgets is paying sufficient attention to their political priorities and where the Committee on Budgets in turn has often considered that the committees are fighting for unrealistic budgetary demands."
"This year we have come further than before, not least when it comes to the traditionally problematic section on what are known as the A30 grants to various European organisations."
"This year through close cooperation with the committees and the political groups we have been able to submit a unanimous proposal from the Committee on Budgets."
"As you know, we have also reformed the budget debate and have already held the major budget debate at the September sitting."
"This was an experiment which I think worked well but there is no doubt that it can be improved further."
"Despite these improvements I am still not satisfied."
"Here I would like to send a signal to our colleagues in the Convention."
"I think that it is unreasonable to make permanent a system involving a long-term budget plan which has such rigid principles for sectoral budget ceilings as those we are living with at the moment."
"Now, only halfway through the budget planning period, they are giving rise to an increasing number of ad hoc systems which risk making the budgeting methodology completely confusing."
"During this year's budget process we have already received proposals from the Commission on use of the flexibility instrument in three cases."
"In the July conciliation we agreed on more planned use of something which should really be an emergency reserve."
"We have solved the Commission's problem of obtaining sufficient personnel resources ahead of enlargement by means of a complicated model of frontloading, which means that we hunt down unused resources for the current year and use them for costs which would otherwise have fallen in 2003."
"Just today in conciliation with the Council we agreed on another new flexibility instrument, the EU Solidarity Fund, to deal with the effects of natural disasters, etc."
"Now, however, we have to ask ourselves how many such flexibility instruments and how many ad hoc solutions we will need before we realise on a wide front that the entire budgeting methodology needs reforming and to become more flexible."
"The Committee on Budgets has also chosen which side it is on."
"We have chosen to consciously exceed the ceilings within three budget categories, partly to demonstrate the absurdity of the current locked system."
"I will return to this when giving more detailed reasons."
"Note that I am not looking to abolish the budget ceilings."
"I am not arguing that we should abandon the demand for budgetary restrictions."
"However, there must be something in between total abandonment and what we are living with at the moment, a rigid planned economy locked for seven years."
"I hope that in the future it will also go without saying that the codecision model must apply to the entire budget, including agricultural policy, and that all the EU's expenses must be included in the budget, including the European Development Fund."
"This is an important area which I hope we can continue to discuss in the years ahead."
"I would now like to mention a more general problem before going into the various budget headings, namely the implementation of the EU's budget."
"This is becoming a serious problem."
"We cannot go back to the citizens, the taxpayers, year after year and tell them that every year we take EUR 15 billion from them unnecessarily, which we then pay back to their grateful ministers of finance."
"I believe that major work is needed on this issue if the Union is to gain credibility for its policies and its budget and if we are to be able to live up to all the promises we make through the budget."
"We must quite simply simplify the administration of the structural funds, which we can start doing right now in the current period."
"We have Commissioner Barnier's word on this, while of course we can be even more radical ahead of the coming programme period."
"I also believe that we must improve the entire process when starting new multi-annual programmes."
"Time after time we are told that when multi-annual programmes are starting their third or fourth programme period we are now in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the third LIFE programme, etc. a whole year is often needed in order to start up activities at the beginning of a new period."
"This is completely preposterous."
"It sometimes means having to compress work intended to take five years into four years in practice."
"A third area where I think we have to achieve an improvement in implementation and simplification is staff issues."
"This year we decided not to use flexibility for new posts in the Commission."
"This does not mean that these posts are not needed."
"In the long term I believe there will be a demand for more posts, partly to operate the new, more decentralised organisation in the external service, but of course this means that the Commission must thoroughly demonstrate that it is working effectively, that reform of the Commission is being carried out, that more efficient management is having an impact, and that, for example, the second step in what is known as the RELEX reform is really being carried out."
"Without these efforts it will be hopeless to argue for more Commission posts, even if we are convinced that they really are necessary in the long term."
"I would now briefly like to address some of the actual problems in each budget area."
"When it comes to agricultural policy, heading 1, the committee has for many years argued for a fundamental change, the development of agricultural policy."
"As a demonstration we have even decided to exceed the budget ceiling by EUR 20 million for sub-heading 1b, rural development, to indicate our position in this respect."
"We consider namely that in the future, money, especially the excess money under heading 1, should be switched to the more proactive rural development policy."
"We also propose that subsidies for the export of live animals should be reduced and accounted for separately."
"This will clearly show how much money is actually being spent on live animal exports."
"By the way, it will be very interesting to see whether the governments which have criticised animal transport, etc. now really seize the opportunity to follow Parliament's line."
"Everything we are proposing is in line with the Commission's proposal for a mid-term review, even if in the resolution we have chosen to call it development of agricultural policy rather than reform."
"Heading 2: the Structural Funds."
"I have already mentioned the problem with implementation."
"Therefore I will now only briefly take up the fisheries question."
"I fully understand that in the current situation the Danish Presidency is prioritising enlargement."
"This is the most important political question but nevertheless, fisheries policy must also be reformed."
"The EU must create sustainable fishing which can survive in the long term."
"While awaiting concrete proposals we have chosen to do two things."
"Firstly we maintain that last year's promise of a further EUR 27 million to convert the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets will be met."
"At the same time we have chosen not to adopt a position on how this is to be funded in detail, we will return to that at a later date."
"When it comes to the budget item for fisheries reform we have chosen to set up such a budget item but not to allocate concrete amounts to it."
"It will be a 'memorandum item'."
"In heading 3, internal policies, I would mainly like to mention information policy."
"We do not accept the Council's and the Commission's proposal for comprehensive slimming down of information policy."
"On the contrary, we think that the union needs better support among its citizens."
"Here information is a necessary lubricant."
"Despite this, however, we are moving the money and our priority is clear, what matters is enlargement and the future of the EU."
"I would also like to point to the external authorities, the agencies."
"Here we have taken a more restrictive line."
"We have followed the Council's draft budget in the vast majority of cases."
"This is because the Member States are on the boards of these agencies and should therefore reasonably take the consequences of these agencies' needs into account in the Council's own budget proposal."
"Unfortunately we have to say that this is not always the case."
"Therefore I believe that this is a matter we will need to discuss somewhat in the future."
"When it comes to pilot projects and preparatory measures, I think we have achieved a very good dialogue with the Commission on their implementation."
"We are now launching some new ideas, including an idea for a pilot project for co-operation between small and medium-sized companies in the EU, not only with the candidate countries but also with countries such as Russia, countries in the Balkans and in North Africa, which I believe will be very important."
"Finally, I would like to concentrate on heading 4, external policies."
"Ever since I entered Parliament in 1999 we have been forced to fight the same battle in this area every year."
"The Council and the Commission propose major new initiatives."
"This has concerned the Balkans and Serbia."
"This year it is Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund, support to the fight against AIDS and other poverty-related illnesses in the developing world."
"No one takes responsibility, however, for allocating the resources needed."
"I think this is absurd."
"The budget ceiling is simply too low."
"Costs have increased every year without any new resources being allocated."
"This year we have chosen to exceed the ceiling but to do it openly by means of an asterisk amendment, where we demand EUR 72 million more for heading 4 with direct reference to Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund."
"We have built this proposal as far as possible on a combination of priorities from our two committees here, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"I believe this is what will be the main point in negotiations with the Council between the first and the second reading."
"It must be resolved if we are to achieve an acceptable role for the EU's external actions."
"This also applies to the common foreign and security policy."
"It is unacceptable that this work is increasingly sliding over more and more from administrative expenses to operational activities but without the influence on the budget which the European Parliament must have in ordinary external relations."
"For this reason we have chosen to set the CFSP grant at the minimum level, 30 million, plus 10 million but we have allocated this through the Cards programme in order to be able to establish the European police task force in Bosnia."
"I believe this is an issue which we must discuss very carefully between the first and the second readings."
"To conclude, I would like to say that this is the last budget for an EU with 15 Member States."
"Therefore, of course, starting to prepare for enlargement has clearly been the utmost priority even in this budget."
"I am particularly pleased to be able to say that we have resolved the majority of the problems with enlargement."
"We have resolved them in broad agreement."
"All the political groups have played their part, as have members from all the national delegations."
"I think this feels like possibly the greatest success of this work this year."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank those who worked together to help produce the budget for 2003."
"I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee on Budgets, the highly competent budget secretariat, the Presidium, above all today's President and, finally, the Commission, the Council and, especially, a very pragmatic and proactive Danish Presidency."
"Throughout this year, the EU's administrative budget, what we term heading 5, has been the budget's major problem."
"We started the year with a large predicted deficit in the 2003 budget."
"This was said to be in the region of EUR 140 million."
"Although this was reduced in various stages during the spring, the Commission in its preliminary draft budget proposed that the flexibility instrument be used to the tune of EUR 66 million, primarily to cover the Commission's costs in completing the preparations for enlargement."
"Both the Council and Parliament opposed such a solution for different reasons."
"Firstly, because it is hard to see an administrative budget as the kind of issue where the flexibility instrument should be used."
"It can hardly be claimed that it is a case of unforeseen expenses or that enlargement is something that has suddenly come upon us."
"The second reason was because, together with other areas where the flexibility instrument has already been earmarked, this would use up half the instrument and thus make it impossible for it to be used in areas where significantly better use could presumably be made of it."
"The third reason, which is not least important for politicians who feel a sense of responsibility, is that the budget limits are actually there to be complied with, even if it can be claimed with a certain amount of justification that the EU's budget is far too rigid."
"When we entered into this agreement between the Council and Parliament at a uniquely early point in Brussels on 19 July, we achieved at least three things."
"We read the whole budget and respected the given ceiling for heading 5, we knew how large the Council's budget was to be and we had limited the European Parliament's own budget."
"Within this framework, the priorities which Parliament had supported even in the guidelines were entirely feasible, these being primarily two things."
"The main and obvious priority was enlargement."
"In view of the decisions subsequently taken, we know that if the Member States comply with their undertakings on ten new Member States at the Council meeting in Copenhagen in December and if the agreements are signed in March, we will be able to have 147 observers from all these countries here at the European Parliament as early as April next year."
"The necessary decisions will be made in terms of property, premises, etc."
"The second priority was implementing necessary reforms."
"These will be required with or without enlargement, especially when it comes to Parliament."
"Here, the issues are primarily those key areas where every parliament, whether national or European, has to be strong."
"As far as the European Parliament is concerned, the issue is one of reinforcing the budget structure, not only of the Committee on Budgets but also of all the other committees in their important work on the budget."
"Furthermore, it is about strengthening Parliament's legislative function."
"In a very short time, this has become a parliament with considerable legislative power."
"As such, the conditions under which this power is exercised must also be improved."
"Once all this was done, there remained two important issues to resolve within the framework of the 2003 budget."
"It was a question of distribution across all the institutions, with approaching enlargement as the main priority in this context too."
"It was also a question of finding a solution for the Commission's unresolved problems regarding financing the preparations for enlargement."
"The latter is particularly important as, following conciliation, one party was clearly the loser, namely the Commission."
"As early as at the conciliation stage, both the Council and Parliament specifically promised to help attempt to solve the Commission's problems ahead of enlargement."
"This promise has subsequently been repeated on numerous occasions both by me and other representatives of both the Council and Parliament."
"It is in this context that the concept of frontloading enters the picture as the instrument we came to use."
"The initial step involved obtaining a figure from all the institutions for the amount of money remaining in the annual budget, that is, the budget for 2002."
"It is these funds which we can use in a second step to reduce pressure on the 2003 budget and which can be transferred to the Commission to ensure that we are able to meet the costs of preparations for enlargement."
"At a meeting attended by the secretaries-general of all the institutions, we thus produced a total sum of approximately EUR 77 million remaining unused by all the institutions in total."
"The maximum amount the Commission can spend on preparing for enlargement amounts to approximately EUR 72 million."
"I would like to say a few words on Parliament's own share of this frontloading."
"According to the proposal which both the Committee on Budgets and Parliament's own Presidium supported last night, this amounted to EUR 43 million for the current year."
"This is money which in fact, in line with the far-sighted way of handling money which Parliament has used hitherto, we should have spent on early repayments on Parliament's own properties."
"We will now postpone this by one year."
"This also means that we will receive some of this money back one year later."
"Of the EUR 43 million which will thus instead be transferred to the Commission, we shall, still in line with the proposal we have to reach an opinion on today, receive EUR 35 million back in 2003."
"In this context, let me mention that the original proposal was for EUR 40 million."
"We are thus now proposing that this be changed to EUR 35 million."
"This means that Parliament's share of this frontloading, seen over two budget years, will be EUR 8 million, a figure which I consider to be well balanced."
"It is generous but, at the same time, well balanced seen in comparison with all the other institutions."
"This shows that this frontloading, as I see it, is developing into a considerable success and could also be used in other contexts in the future."
"It creates the opportunity to use a budget over several years to make the best possible use of resources."
"Earlier, I mentioned that we promised the Commission that we would contribute to attempting to solve the problems of the costs of preparing for enlargement."
"A promise is a promise and, as we know, it must be kept."
"We now stand here having implemented frontloading which gives us the opportunity to comply with what we promised."
"This is an excellent feeling."
"For me, all this is also about a kind of investment in good relations."
"Enlargement will only succeed if we realise that it actually is something we must work on together. It is a joint undertaking."
"As the rapporteur, I am very grateful for the way in which all the institutions, large and small, have played their part in attempting to resolve this very difficult situation."
"Mr President, Mr Färm, Mr Stenmarck, ladies and gentlemen, we have taken a massive step towards the enlargement of the European Union with the positive result of the referendum in Ireland."
"It is now up to the Council to agree on a common negotiating position for financing issues at the summit this week in Brussels, that is to say how much in the way of resources can be included in the European Union Budget for the new Member States as from 2004."
"This once again clearly signals that the 2003 Budget will very probably be the last budget for a Union of 15 Member States."
"So we are pretty much on the eve of enlargement."
"That means that the 2003 financial year will not only present further challenges for the candidate countries, but also for the European institutions that need to make preparations."
"There have been some serious differences here between the Council and the Commission, because the Council only approved additional posts for itself for 2003 in the run-up to enlargement, but rejected additional posts for the Commission."
"So it is all the more incomprehensible that, in its own preparations for the Brussels Summit, the Council repeatedly highlights its expectations of the Commission for 2003 in terms of preparation for enlargement, for example in relation to the Structural Funds."
"But that requires staff too, of course."
"So the Commission has all the more reason to appreciate the fact that the European Parliament has taken the initiative to ensure that the Commission's requests are met."
"I would like to express my respect for all the rapporteurs, and in particular Mr Stenmarck and Mr Färm, for the way in which they have not only gained support for frontloading, but have also vehemently fought, every step of the way, for it to be implemented."
"I would like to thank you for your comments, Mr Stenmarck."
"You made a promise and you have kept it, which we really appreciate."
"Once again, I would like to express my very sincere thanks, on behalf of the Commission, to the rapporteurs and to the Committee on Budgets."
"This idea will now be implemented by means of an interinstitutional rectifying budget, and the very fact that there is an interinstitutional rectifying budget is an achievement in itself."
"So thank you for your support."
"Let me turn now to expenditure on the common agricultural policy."
"As you know, the Commission has pursued the same line as the European Parliament, that is a restructuring of market-related expenditure and market organisation so as to strengthen support for rural areas."
"The Commission made this subject a key element of its mid-term review proposals."
"We cannot, however, agree to these proposals being implemented now, as the rules still prevent this and an increase in resources for the rural development programme go beyond the current provision in the Financial Perspective."
"You have, however, also proposed another amendment, and you, Mr Färm, stressed this again just now, to the effect that the budget headings for export refunds for animals should be subdivided so that refunds for live animals can be identified separately."
"I think that this could be considered, as long as the relevant legal bases allow it."
"I share your concern about the need for enhanced animal protection and it is also very much shared by the Commission as a whole."
"A third of the Budget will once again be devoted to structural policy next year."
"There was a debate in plenary in September about the implementation of the Structural Fund programmes, and Mr Färm has one again spoken very clearly about this."
"You very emphatically call for the procedures to be simplified, to allow Member States to draw down funds more quickly and more simply."
"My colleague responsible for this, Mr Barnier, held a seminar on this in order to establish what scope there is here."
"This was a further indication of the fact that the Commission is very committed to this issue."
"However, we also need the Member States' cooperation, and it simply is not good enough if the Member States' estimates of the level of Structural Fund appropriations they implement in a year, that is how much they can actually use, are as wide of the mark as they have been in recent years."
"As far as this is concerned, I have to say that we have of course to jointly check whether the increased budget appropriations proposed here by Parliament are necessary for the Structural Funds next year."
"The Commission is largely able to support the amendments proposed by the Committee on Budgets as regards appropriations for internal policies, for example in the case of measures in favour of immigration and asylum policy, measures in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the proposal in the area of information policy."
"As regards the budget for external policies, however, I am not in complete agreement at present. One example here is the Global Health Fund to fight diseases such as AIDS."
"Of course there is no denying that the Commission rates the importance of this global fund very highly."
"But the issue now is what level of appropriations is needed for 2003, and also what the source of the funding is to be."
"The Commission has once again proposed that half of the appropriations should be financed from the European Development Fund."
"I would like to emphasise once again that by far the greatest proportion of appropriations for this global fund has up to now been financed by the European Union, that is to say partly from Community resources and partly from the Member States' bilateral resources."
"One priority area in the budget for external policies is aid for the Balkan states."
"A new feature of the 2003 budget is the addition of appropriations for joint police missions to Bosnia."
"The Commission has already for this reason added a further EUR 10 million to the Common Foreign and Security Policy budget."
"Parliament's proposal is that this additional sum should be removed again, or rather not inserted in the first place."
"I am, however, sure that by the time we get to the second reading of the Budget we will have been able to find a way to finance this important area of external policy."
"In relation to the new challenge for the EU Budget of providing appropriate aid for Afghanistan, the Commission welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgets has agreed to insert a special budget heading."
"We also welcome this because the task of providing financial assistance to Afghanistan will of course recur in the budget over the next few years."
"It is, however, precisely because of this that we believe this financing should have a regular place in the budget, and should not be provided by calling on the flexibility reserve."
"Nevertheless, the Commission believes that there is a continuing need to use the flexibility reserve, not least to find a financial solution in the coming year for the issue of fisheries reform and to provide Portugal and Spain with the remaining resources needed to restructure their fishing fleets."
"If Parliament's proposal is adopted, the 2003 Budget will represent 1.05% of the combined economic output of all the Member States, that is to say the same level as this year."
"I am mentioning this because there are still some very contentious debates going on about the Brussels Summit."
"However, if the proposal on the table for the financing of enlargement in 2004, 2005 and 2006 is adopted, this ratio between the EU budget and European economic output, even with another ten members, will not again reach the level it stood at in the mid-1990s."
"If we consider once again the size of the EU Budget and how small the increase currently envisaged is in view of enlargement, then I must say I do not really consider that the debate currently raging is actually justified. If anything, there is a danger that discussions on financing will focus too much on individual issues and perhaps get bogged down in them."
"We should, however, bear in mind that the enlargement of the EU is a very good investment in the future, an excellent investment."
"In view of this I wish at this point to appeal to the Heads of State and Government to agree on a common position in Brussels so that, following the yes vote in Ireland, we can stick to the timetable for the enlargement of Europe."
"Mr President, I wish to join with the others in thanking our redoubtable duo, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for their excellent work on behalf of Parliament during this budget procedure."
"They have both outlined that we are now thinking of a Union which will be extended to at least 25 countries."
"For both Parliament and the Commission, enlargement is the main emphasis of this budget."
"I would like to express a personal view."
"I hope that in future we will avoid too many referenda and too many votes being taken on particular subjects."
"It might become contagious in this House and we might adopt a resolution and then consider voting again because we have reached the wrong conclusions."
"That said, I should like to refer to Parliament's and the Commission's budget."
"Our group has strategies for both these budgets, and they have by and large been implemented as we reach the current stage of the budget procedure."
"On Parliament's budget, we would like to emphasise the need for extended provision for freelance translation - because this is going to be an important factor in the years ahead."
"We are pleased that early retirement has been extended to the political groups, and thank the Council for that - even if it is absent from this debate this afternoon."
"We would like full transparency in the Council in future and for all its legislative discussions to be open to the public."
"These are questions which all our group supports."
"On the Commission budget, there are four relevant points."
"Firstly, on payments and backlog, we would like to see a real effort being made to reduce the EUR 110 billion in commitments."
"We are asking, as stated in the resolution, for a report from the Commission as to how it is going to achieve this objective of eliminating outstanding commitments."
"Secondly, on internal policies, we are still looking for better value for money and for some of the monies for information policy to be retained in reserve, because we would like to see savings on administration and human resources."
"We expect a report from the Commission on this subject by 30 April 2003."
"Thirdly, on external policies, we would like improved accountability."
"Therefore, we are supporting the appeal by our rapporteur for more information concerning the interinstitutional agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission on the expenditure of money on foreign and security policy."
"We would also like to know what kinds of expenditure the Council is expecting over the next five years, because we also agree with the rapporteur that it is unhealthy to think that the Council is going to be involved in large expenditure of funds which would not be subject to normal accountability and use."
"Equally, we are asking the Commission to come forward with some form of thought process."
"There seems to be some lethargy on the part of the Commission when it comes to thinking through what kind of priorities we should have for foreign and security policy in the future."
"Lastly, my group would like me to say that we want to see this reform process completed and we need to look at how this whole process is being conducted."
"We are convinced that progress has been made but we are not yet convinced that this whole programme of reform is going to be implemented."
"We would like to know that you are out there selling it to the general public and that these reforms will be completed by the end of next year, as the most recent reform document from the Commission stated."
"But, before we approve the new posts, we would very much like to see the reform elements in place and to know you are convinced that this whole reform process will be completed."
"If this is not done so by the end of the current term of the Commission and Parliament, we will be in breach of the commitments we made to our electorate to ensure that real institutional reforms are carried out."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I too would of course like to thank our two rapporteurs."
"Parliament has had what you might call a Swedish experience, and I think that it has been a good experience. It has been very much geared towards consensus and has been imaginative and flexible in equal measure, and has for once closely examined structural aspects."
"I am sure that this Budget procedure also has structural side effects that need to be very carefully examined."
"From this perspective, I would also like to make the following comment: we have heard several times that this is the last Budget for just 15 Member States before enlargement."
"But I hope that it is also one of the last Budgets before the convention secures full budget rights for this House, in the medium term at least, in relation to all types of expenditure policy and income policy."
"That is a request that we have made."
"You know that I have repeated this request during every Budget procedure; it has become a familiar refrain."
"I think it is important that we should help to democratise the Budget procedure here."
"The hallmark of the Budget as we draw it up at present is that heated debates rage during the budget-setting process around every million, sometimes even every thousand euros, yet during the year we often have to shift funds around and restructure the Budget."
"This year alone we will probably draw up six supplementary and amending budgets."
"We will have between 70 and 80 carry-overs, which means that a great many appropriations will have to be moved around."
"Not only this year, but also in previous years, both during the budget procedure and right at the end of the year we have had to resort to frontloading in order to finance things that strictly speaking fall in the following year."
"We also demonstrate by means of this pragmatic approach that we are prepared to finance essential aspects of European policy, and that although we set a Budget at the beginning of the year, there is so much flexibility and room for manoeuvre that at the end of the year the Budget is no longer as reliable as might have been wished and assumed at the outset, when we were discussing certain issues so forcefully."
"That means that this form of budget setting at the very least needs reflecting upon."
"We should take this into account in the coming weeks, months and years when we are further developing our budget policy."
"As the Commissioner has said, the 2003 Budget is a thrifty one."
"We will be spending just 1.05% of GNP to tackle all the tasks facing the European Union."
"If you look at the position of those countries that are net contributors, which are so often the subject of debate, you will find that the biggest net contributors pay no more than 0.3 to 0.7% of their GNP."
"That ranges from 0.3% for my own country and 0.7% of GNP, to finance this European policy."
"0.3% for Germany!"
"So much for the heated debates that we are always having about how expensive this is all supposed to be!"
"In the context of the Budget, we try to husband our resources carefully."
"We try to ensure that balances are maintained."
"That will be a job for the future - starting with balances in this continent."
"We need a financially balanced Europe in the long term."
"We need to make sure that our institutions are capable of functioning, not forgetting the prospect of enlargement, and also bearing in mind the maturing process that our institutions and the European Union as a whole are going through."
"These are long-term tasks."
"We need to ensure that people in Europe who place their trust in us can rely on financial balance and are not taken unawares by short-term changes."
"I would like to make this point very specifically in the case of agriculture, but it also applies to regional policy."
"We are also interested in seeing reform of our regional policy and in unblocking the backlog of appropriations still to be executed."
"I would, however, like to say this, Commissioner: it is not enough for Commissioner Barnier to examine how Structural Fund bureaucracy can be dismantled."
"That is something that applies to all the EU support programmes."
"I would be pleased if the other Commissioners affected were to behave in the same way."
"We therefore need to strike a balance in our continent."
"But we as Europeans also need a balance between continents, because we are not just a fortunate island; we also have to think about relations between the continents."
"In the past we have repeatedly used our external policy to help other regions of the world."
"This has become ever more difficult, because new tasks have been added to the ones we originally embarked upon: financing, reconstruction, the Balkans, financing reconstruction in Afghanistan, and also the enormous task of improving world health, not least the battle against AIDS."
"That is not just an issue in Africa, it affects the whole world and that includes our own continent."
"Money needs to be earmarked for that."
"There is a lot we could say about financing, Mrs Schreyer, but there is no denying that we have a responsibility here that we need to shoulder."
"It is hard to do all this."
"Category 4 has caused us major headaches this year, just as in previous years."
"We have to be flexible if we want to solve all the world's problems."
"But there is one thing we need to be clear about: Europe's citizens can rest assured that we will protect their interests in this continent."
"However, we are also keen to ensure that our continent occupies an appropriate position in the world as a whole."
"We intend to set budgets in conjunction with you in a thrifty and sound way but at the same time with an eye to the future."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteurs for the budget, Göran Färm and Per Stenmarck, for their thorough and constructive work."
"I should likewise like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terence Wynn."
"I also want to thank Denmark, as the country holding the presidency, for its excellent levels of cooperation, as well as Commissioner Michaele Schreyer."
"The draft budget meets most of the demands of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"It is thrifty and rigorous, and the payment appropriations account for just 1.04% of GNP, while 1.08% has been provided in the financial perspective for expenditure."
"There is therefore a margin of more than EUR 3 billion in the budget."
"The draft budget now before us is also available in the form of an activity-based budget."
"This has to do with the Commission's administrative reform."
"The Financial Regulation has been undergoing reforms that will come into effect from the start of next year."
"This entails a revision of the staff regulations, which Parliament is now debating."
"This is a complete package of reforms intended to boost administrative efficiency, promote the downward delegation of authority, and clarify personal accountability."
"These are objectives our group wholeheartedly supports."
"The undoubted focus of the budget is enlargement."
"This budget will probably be the last to be drafted for a Union of 15 Member States."
"There is provision in it for some very important appropriations."
"The Committee on Budgets is proposing an extra EUR 699 million in pre-accession aid for the candidate countries to make it easier for them to face the challenges of membership."
"The problem regarding administrative appropriations is insufficient margin for manoeuvre under heading 5."
"For that reason, the different institutions have started gathering funds out of this year's budget to be able to pay the costs of accession in advance."
"For example, Parliament intends to lend the Commission EUR 43 million and the Council EUR 18 million."
"In other words, levels of cooperation have been exemplary, and my sincerest thanks for that go especially to the rapporteur for the budget, Per Stenmarck."
"The most serious problem in administering the EU budget is outstanding commitments and unused payment appropriations."
"Outstanding commitments now amount to around EUR 107 billion, or more than the EU's total budget for one year."
"The reason for this is the under-utilisation of payment appropriations."
"This particularly concerns the Structural Funds and external actions."
"Last year EUR 18 billion in payment appropriations remained unspent and the figure for the previous year was EUR 11 billion."
"Under-utilisation on this scale seriously undermines the entire administrative process with regard to the EU budget."
"In the spring outstanding commitments under the Structural Funds reached EUR 80 billion."
"Despite this, though, the Council reduced the amount in payment appropriations that was proposed by the Commission."
"That is why the Committee on Budgets increased payments by more than a billion euros."
"Our group is calling for a dramatic simplification in the administration of the Structural Funds."
"With these comments we are prepared to give the draft budget our support."
"Mr President, there are some agreements that are stupid because they are inflexible."
"That is the reason why someone in a very authoritative position said the Stability and Growth Pact was stupid."
"Some of the representatives from France, Germany and Portugal in our group might agree, as might some Italians also."
"Stupid too is the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline, which was concluded in May 1999."
"That was the last job of the previous Parliament carried out for the present one."
"It is on account of this stupid agreement that the European Parliament is virtually powerless when it comes to budgetary policy."
"All we can do is sit around counting paper clips and spend our time in petty administrative tasks."
"Mr Prodi said of the Growth and Stability Pact that the reality that lies behind it is multi-layered and that the institutions should take this into consideration and act flexibly."
"The same has to be said about the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline."
"Heading 4, the section that deals with external actions, is especially stupid in terms of its inflexibility."
"We all know, everyone in this House knows, that the budget is in that respect 'quasi-rigid'."
"A ceiling was fixed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, regarding which the Council is unwilling to be flexible."
"Parliament has had the onerous task of trying to fit new priorities that both Parliament and the Council think important under the 1999 ceiling."
"A few million has been discussed, and at the same time there might possibly be a billion in appropriations in heading 4 still not forwarded for payment."
"Thus, there is money in this heading which everybody knows is not being spent."
"One of the biggest problems with the budgetary procedure is how to include as an extension to the unpaid appropriations in this heading the new appropriations we want to pay, and which we need to pay, in order to fulfil the wishes of the budgetary authorities."
"As the Interinstitutional Agreement is terrorising the drafting of the budget, it must come as no surprise to anyone that if EUR 10 billion remains unused from this budget it will go back to the Member States."
"I call the Interinstitutional Agreement stupid because of its inflexibility, and the same goes for the Council that is perpetuating this inflexibility."
"I cannot, however, agree with the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, regarding the stupidity of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Well done, Sweden!"
"The Swedish rapporteurs have done an excellent job."
"Not being given the floor until after the GUE/NGL Group has spoken still requires a psychological adjustment on my part, but I am afraid I will have to get used to it."
"Mr President, it is customary for us MEPs to initially react a little critically to the Council's absence from our plenary."
"However, during our previous budgetary debate, the Council made a huge effort to sit here for four hours solidly, so I do not think we will take offence on this occasion."
"I should, however, like to make a suggestion to the Council."
"This morning, a video conference conciliation meeting took place with the Council for the first time, and we managed to reach agreement on the Solidarity Fund live on screen."
"Next time there is a debate in the plenary that coincides with its own meetings, the Council could perhaps follow it on screen, and it could submit its comments virtually."
"In fact, the Dutch Government could easily have done the honours."
"Since the Dutch Government has resigned and parliament still has not adopted a position on enlargement, it has been agreed that the Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister will be present in Luxembourg over the next few days but will certainly not be saying anything."
"Since this is not a first for us in Parliament, the Dutch minister could have easily kept his mouth shut here in Strasbourg."
"But anyway, we are here to discuss the 2003 Budget."
"I should first of all like to thank my fellow MEPs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, for the work they have done, which has culminated in the first reading of the Budget that is now before us."
"In my view, they have acquitted themselves of their tasks as rapporteurs expertly, and they were, and still are, very approachable for all the groups."
"They are really not to blame, therefore, but I should nevertheless like to share with you the fact that I cannot muster any real enthusiasm for this budgetary debate or for the 2003 Budget that is before us."
"When I explain to people why I have chosen to sit on the Committee on Budgets, then I always use the argument that the EU's Budget covers all areas."
"As such, it pertains to structural funds, agriculture, environmental policy, research, social exclusion measures and the reconstruction of war-torn areas, and we are not talking peanuts, but about an amount in the region of EUR 100 billion."
"Of course, what I am saying is true, but it is only half the story."
"After all, the political battle we are fighting here today in the plenary is really not about shifting billions or about the overall picture, but about millions and about shifting the accents."
"This is due to both the rigid financial perspectives and the various pieces of legislation that have already been laid down and as a result of which our hands are tied."
"Take agricultural policy, for example."
"When my group suggests bringing up the export subsidies for discussion because many farmers in developing countries are seriously hampered in their economic potential, then the argument of administrative assurance is used."
"The export subsidies form part of existing policy, and we in Parliament cannot simply change this in a budgetary debate."
"Which is right, of course."
"It is, however, also important for us to send out a political signal."
"We are a political forum, after all."
"As it happens, no substantive arguments have been put forward against our proposal to scrap export subsidies."
"Instead, that three billion has simply been approved, as have the enormous amounts for the production of European tobacco, which we happen to think is extremely harmful to public health."
"My group is also very critical about the amounts set aside for the Trans-European Networks."
"After eight years, most of the projects are still in their infancy."
"Yet still nobody dares say in public that the EU subsidies may, to some extent, be money down the drain."
"We simply carry on undeterred, not always taking the best projects forward."
"The Member States themselves grant priority to national projects, while the value-added of European funding is surely the fact that they must be cross-border projects."
"The Commission is now having to come up with all kinds of emergency measures to support the real cross-border projects, although this is, of course, a somewhat bizarre situation."
"Similarly, with regards to structural funding, Member States pursue double and often conflicting priorities, which partly explain the enormous delays in implementation."
"On the one hand, they are all out for getting as much out of the Brussels money coffers as possible, but at the same time they struggle to find national co-financing because those projects are not always a national priority."
"My conclusion is therefore that the Member States feel less responsible for European money or for the fact that it should be spent carefully and fairly, than they do for national funds."
"This is quite remarkable when you think that it is all money originating from the same tax payer."
"Another area of doubt concerning correct spending is of a wholly different nature."
"I hope that Parliament will support me in this."
"It concerns the funding for Kedo."
"We touched upon this briefly last night."
"The European taxpayer is financing a nuclear energy plant in North Korea."
"My group is opposed to this as a matter of principle in any case, because we prefer to support sustainable energy."
"But anyway, this is the way things are, and I know that a majority in Parliament is in favour of it."
"However, it now turns out that North Korea is probably also developing nuclear weapons."
"It is clear to me that we should examine this carefully, and it also seems to make sense to me to place this money in the reserve and not to release it until we have clarity about the programmes pertaining to this plant."
"I should also like to ask the European Commissioner for her opinion and whether she is already intending to place this money in the reserve at second reading."
"These are all examples of money that is being spent but against which I would place question marks as to their judiciousness."
"Then there is also a category of credits which I think should be spent, or even more should be spent."
"One such example is enlargement."
"There is a fine Dutch expression that says 'goedkoop is duurkoop' [you get what you pay for], and I am leaving it up to the interpreters to find a sound translation for this."
"I am not in favour of wasting money, but I do believe in delivering on our promises and seizing historical opportunities."
"The situation happens to be different from the one we anticipated in 1999 when the financial perspectives were laid down in Berlin."
"Not six, but probably ten countries, will be joining, and not in 2002, but in 2004."
"The financial plan should therefore be adjusted accordingly."
"However, because of their 'accountant' attitude, the net payers are not interested."
"My group will in any event be endorsing the amendments which will enable this to be adjusted, as I am convinced that we will ultimately be paying a hefty price."
"The situation in category four has also changed."
"Regarding the reconstruction of the Balkans and Afghanistan, it has often been said that it is impossible to deliver on all promises in category four, unless cutbacks are made in various other priorities."
"For example, a downward adjustment was made to the multiannual programme for the other western Balkan countries due to the situation in post-Milosevic Serbia."
"What will we do if peace is established in the Middle East?"
"What programmes will we be offering then?"
"I have already listed the areas where I am quite happy to cut back by a few billion, but I should like to see a few million added here."
"Another area where an extra few million would not go amiss is category five, administrative expenditure."
"It is no secret that I was unhappy with the deal concluded during July's conciliation."
"According to this deal, Parliament and the Council look after each other's needs, and it was agreed that the Commission would be served via a frontloading operation."
"This worked out well."
"The 500 additional positions for enlargement will probably be created."
"However, the political signal is rather unpleasant, in my view."
"The Commission is not a closing entry; it is necessary for a smooth enlargement process."
"Ironically, the people who are most critical of enlargement and of the capacity of the candidate countries to implement the acquis communautaire are often the very people who refuse to allow the Commission to have sufficient staffing levels to implement and monitor the implementation of the acquis communautaire."
"In my opinion, the frontloading method is not particularly attractive, nor terribly transparent, as Mr Walter has already stated."
"Despite this, I should like to extend warm congratulations to the rapporteurs on the result, because in the final analysis, it is the result that counts."
"Mrs Buitenweg, I understand how you feel when you say that you are not used to speaking after the GUE/NGL Group, but it may be of some comfort to know that you were allowed to speak for three times as long."
"That too is a fine thing!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in this debate on the first reading of the budget for the financial year 2003, I do not wish to focus on the technical aspects."
"Indeed, I have taken the floor on several occasions in recent months to condemn what I consider to be the shortcomings and historic inconsistencies of the Community budget such as the RALs or the financing of internal policies and external actions, and also to draw your attention to the specific problems which have only come to light in recent months such as, for example, the ceiling for the administrative expenditure heading, which is too low, and, more generally, the inadequacy of the Financial Perspective agreed in Berlin in 1999."
"Today, I want to try and address the situation from a political perspective - if it can be described as such - rather than a technical perspective."
"At a historic time such as that we are currently experiencing, when the international system is continually changing, on the one hand, and with enlargement and the debate on the future of Europe taking place, on the other, I feel that we too, who are experts in financial matters, should start to think about the role we want the European Parliament to play."
"The question is as follows: should we agree to be mere implementors of rules, rules for the most part written by others, or do we want to be able to change things?"
"For example, how do we feel about the fact that the Council was able to obtain a legal basis from the Commission regarding the issue of natural disasters, for instance, which is an extremely important matter? Would we not also like to be in a position where we can contribute to the Commission's work?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, very often, we hide - and I am talking about us as a whole political class, of course - behind respect for rules and procedures without even attempting to make genuine changes to them or to the way they are applied. Changes that would be for the better, of course."
"This is the message I want to be conveyed as an addendum to this debate."
"The 2003 budget is proving to be a good one, and I congratulate the rapporteurs on their commitment, all the effort they have put in and the results achieved, thanks, not least, to Commissioner Schreyer, the entire Commission structure, the secretariat and the draftsmen, but I can only emphasise that this is a technical budget in which our role has been primarily that of making the figures add up, lacking as we do the strength, the courage and the will to introduce genuine political measures."
"It may be that we younger Members want to change the world sometimes, but, this time, I would be content just to change a few tiny elements of our European budget."
"Mr President, we would like to add three comments concerning the Budget at this reading."
"First of all, at the Commission's proposal, Parliament decided to set up a Solidarity Fund within the budget lines B2-400 and B7-090 during the previous sitting."
"I expressed our doubts surrounding this fund at the time, and I shall now confine myself to the budgetary aspects."
"This fund is, to all intents and purposes, virtual, for it is still empty."
"When a major disaster does strike, we will need to find resources in the Budget for this Fund retrospectively."
"This strikes us as highly improbable."
"Furthermore, if more than one disaster strikes in any one calendar year, the Fund's upper limit (EUR 1 billion) may also create a problem."
"Imagine that a major disaster strikes in the spring, to which the Commission assigns EUR 700 million from this Fund."
"What would happen if another disaster on a similar scale were to strike in the autumn?"
"There is the risk that the resources allocated for the following year would be released prematurely."
"This could be the thin end of the wedge."
"Given the uncertain origin of the Fund's resources, we are faced with the undesirable situation whereby there is a Fund for which no provisions have been made in the 2003 Budget."
"This means that after a number of years, considerable pressure could be brought to bear on the Member States to make additional contributions."
"Given the current economic situation and the freedom in budgetary policy that some Member States allow themselves, I can foresee major problems."
"I should now like to make a critical comment on the Budget for the Sixth Framework Programme on research and development."
"The funding of research from the EU budget brings with it ethical dilemmas, as is the case, for example, in research on embryos."
"In the fanatical fight to fund research of this kind, the entire framework programme will soon be in the balance because at second reading Parliament refused to make any more guideline statements about the funding of controversial areas."
"Moreover, the Council would have been better to start the debate on ethics sooner and postpone the ethical guidelines until after the programme had been accepted."
"This controversy demonstrates that the framework programme should have been restricted to facilitating cross-border cooperation."
"Active financial support is undesirable and superfluous."
"Why should we co-finance research that is likely to take place anyway?"
"My third and final comment concerns fisheries."
"The Commission and Parliament devote much attention to the Spanish and Portuguese fishermen who, together with their regions, are let down by the lack of an agreement with Morocco."
"Millions of euros have been spent on compensation, reducing the numbers of fishermen and re-training them in those regions."
"Other fishing regions are also starting to feel the pinch now."
"Apparently, biologists are now advising the Commission to ban cod fishing and to reduce other quotas."
"This would have a major financial impact in the Netherlands, among others."
"Would it not make sense, therefore, to shift the budget's attention to fishing regions that have been self-sufficient to date?"
"Financial support for those regions in the form of socio-economic programmes is desirable."
"This aspect, however, is still missing from this budget which spends millions on fisheries agreements with third countries, from which only a minority of countries and shipowners benefit."
"Speaking of solidarity, it would not hurt for the EU to devote more attention financially to a fishing industry that has not been able to make use of subsidies for the renovation and building of ships for years."
"This has caused unfair competition for many years."
"A fisheries sector that keeps to the quotas should be able to expect more from Brussels."
"Mr President, much has already been said by previous speakers."
"We distribute some of our funds indiscriminately, we set too few priorities, and we also finance ineffective actions, if you consider that we still allow ourselves the luxury of two parliamentary places of work and are therefore also paying for very questionable tourism for Members as well as a Convention that is costing millions."
"Europe needs new impetus."
"We need an offensive on the economy, including measures to make cheap capital - I mean venture capital - available above all to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It is precisely here that effective initiatives are lacking in the 2003 Budget."
"There is an urgent need for action when it comes to introducing the Basle II provisions, above all when we consider that 45% of European small and medium-sized enterprises have little or no own resources."
"As well as changing the way in which aid is allocated in agriculture, in the future we will also have to change the distribution criteria in the Structural Funds."
"The standard of living in a region should not be used to assess the situation or be a factor in the amount of aid allocated."
"Companies or sectors that need support should all receive these funds, regardless of whether the company is located in the north, south or east."
"We must use the funds entrusted to us more efficiently and more carefully, if we also wish to co-finance enlargement."
"Mr President, after 15 minutes from Mr Färm and 10 minutes from Mr Stenmarck and all the other contributions, there is not much left to say."
"I was giving evidence recently to one of the subcommittees of the Convention, chaired by Mr Amato, on simplification."
"I made the point that the language of the budget is probably the twelfth language in this institution."
"Listening to this debate, where the words 'ramassage' and 'frontloading' are being used so often, it seems as though they have become part of the everyday lexicon of our budget language."
"I also said that we need only one reading of the budget, and that would simplify the whole process."
"Had that system applied today, I am sure we would not have voted for the budget that we now have. I say that because a lot of people are concerned about the way in which this budget will be voted on Thursday."
"I do not just mean the Commission and the Council, but colleagues from a variety of parliamentary committees."
"I want to make one point absolutely clear to anyone who shares these worries: this is, after all, a first reading to show we have political priorities and to put some pressure on the Council, it is not the end of the story."
"These concerns have arisen because of what the committee adopted."
"We exceeded the ceilings in three categories - in category 1b we will have to see how Parliament votes on Thursday."
"On category 2, we are duty-bound to find a solution with the Council."
"On category 4, we also need to find a solution together with the Council."
"That is why the decisions have been taken in category 4, to try to ensure that there will be real dialogue with the Council to solve some of the political problems in that area."
"As others have said, the ceiling on category 4 has been a problem ever since we concluded the interinstitutional agreement."
"Every year since then we have had to use the flexibility instrument."
"Some may agree with Mr Seppänen that the agreement is stupid."
"I am one of those who voted for it."
"That might make me stupid, but the reality is that this Parliament agreed it, and we have to live with it and within its restrictions."
"I hope that when it comes to the next interinstitutional agreement we will have learnt lessons from this one, especially in category 4."
"However, this time the needs in category 4 - especially in the areas of Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund - have to be sorted out."
"On the Global Health Fund, there are certainly big differences of opinion between the Commission, the Council and ourselves."
"To make it worse, at least one Member State is asking us to find the extra EUR 65 million, which complicates matters when we know what the Council's position is already."
"When I say it has to be sorted out, I mean we have to find a real solution with the Council, not going into a conciliation or trialogues and playing the usual games."
"We have serious problems in these areas and we need a real sense of cooperation."
"It must be said that we have had a good working relationship with the Danish presidency."
"We should not condemn the Danish presidency for not being here."
"They have apologised to me and explained that they have other commitments."
"The fact that the President-in-Office sat for 4 ½ hours at our last meeting showed his commitment."
"They have been quite good in the way they have worked with Parliament."
"They have respected Parliament and Parliament's will."
"The Danish presidency has been good to work with."
"As Mrs Buitenweg said, the presidency has also been good today, even in the videoconference on the European Solidarity Fund."
"But let us hope that those good relationships can continue as we go into the next conciliation, prior to the second reading by the Council."
"I also made the point at the Convention that, in contrast to the American War of Independence, where the cry was 'no taxation without representation', we in this Parliament have the luxury of having representation without taxation."
"That makes the Council often think that we are profligate with taxpayers' money."
"The message we need to give to the Council is that the budgets we vote here are serious and prudent, but they have political priorities."
"I hope that, in December, we will have achieved some of those political priorities."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and the Commissioner."
"As we have already stated, the Group of the Liberal Democrat and Reform Party is fairly satisfied with this budget, which would appear to be rigorous and transparent throughout."
"This is part of our tradition. I would, however, immediately add that, in my view, it is also an excessively technical budget with only a very limited political dimension."
"We can accept the basic lines, particularly those relating to reform and enlargement, of course, which I feel is the greatest challenge facing us."
"However, precisely because it is a challenge, we must take more decisive, political action, action which is, above all, more visible to all the European citizens."
"I too, like the Committee Chairman, who spoke just now, feel that it is imperative that the procedure is reformed."
"The technical elements of the procedure need to be revised, it needs to be simplified and, in particular, its cultural and political dimensions need to be developed, with the Council's powers defined in such a way that they are maximised, not reduced, to achieve a more effective, more focused and, above all, more topical debate."
"There needs to be a basic philosophy underlying the European budget, a basic philosophy of shared, not concentrated, administrative responsibility - and I stress, shared: this is extremely important - and Parliament needs to have a greater political role, for it must discharge its mandate as effectively as possible."
"Parliament, like the Union as a whole, must be a visibly political institution and make political responses."
"I will focus on just two technical aspects."
"The first concerns the issue of category 4, which my colleague has already touched on. I would add something further."
"It may be that we pay little or rather too little attention to the Mediterranean question, it may be that we pay too little attention to the issue of the Middle East."
"We go so far as to debate reconstruction, Afghanistan and issues concerning very distant countries, but there is a matter nearer to home which we will soon, all too soon, have to address more thoroughly and much more decisively."
"I will mention one more issue: culture."
"The funds committed for young people, training and information are utterly inadequate."
"Mr President, in March 2002 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on guidelines for the 2003 Budget."
"A series of issues were mentioned that are of the utmost significance for the future viability of our policies on agriculture and rural development."
"These include the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, consumer protection and enlargement."
"I hope that the Commission is sufficiently courageous and competent also to take account of these long-term objectives when it is implementing the budget and that it will not be distracted by more immediate political concerns."
"I hope that sources of conflict, such as shortcomings in accounting procedures, fiddling and cooking of the books, are eliminated and that instead transparency and strict discipline are the order of the day when the budget is implemented."
"Both nationally and internationally, interested members of the public are presented with a confused and contradictory picture of agricultural policy."
"As they currently stand, Commissioner Fischler's proposals have not met with the approval of a majority."
"More work therefore needs to be done on them."
"Despite the fact that the applicant countries have made huge economic and social adjustments, the Berlin decisions provide that the funds to be transferred to the accession countries, in the form of pre-accession aid, and expenditure on enlargement are to be maintained as laid down and made public."
"Several discussions in which I have participated have reinforced my view, in favour of the applicant countries, that the 25% rule for direct payments is politically unacceptable; in addition the applicant countries fear high losses and are demanding an accession rebate and a change in their quotas."
"This will have a major impact on the funding of the agricultural policy and the current financial perspective will have to be revised."
"How much will enlargement cost?"
"That is the question."
"How we are to respond to this in the 2003 Budget remains unknown."
"A vital question for the agricultural sector is 1.05% + X and for as long as it remains unanswered the implementation of the 2003 Budget will remain a dangerous business as far as agriculture is concerned."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck on their excellent work on the 2003 budget."
"It is important to remember that the budget is there to support policy decisions taken either by the Council or by the Council and Parliament jointly."
"It is inappropriate to seek to use budgetary procedure as a means of shaping that policy."
"I am referring in particular to certain recommendations relating to agricultural and structural funds."
"The proposal to reduce export subsidies is both misplaced and ill judged, especially since it is aimed at forcing a policy decision, mainly a reduction in the transport of live animals."
"The budget is not the appropriate instrument for such policy decisions, regardless of how one might feel about the issue."
"As far as the substance is concerned, we should remember that we live in a global economy, with strong competitors for agricultural trade."
"In the current climate of depressed prices and policy uncertainty, we are going to place our farmers at a further disadvantage."
"Let me assure you that, if the EU decided to ban live animal exports today, the Australians would step in and take over our markets straight away."
"This is an important commercial consideration that must be borne in mind."
"Staying with agriculture, I share the concern of many colleagues over the proposed across-the-board reduction of EUR 275 million in agricultural spending."
"Clearly this proposal is out of touch with current agricultural realities."
"My own group has tabled a number of amendments which seek to undo some of the potential damage."
"Likewise, the proposed quota of EUR 525 million in structural fund payment appropriations."
"As a representative of an Objective 1 region in the north and west of Ireland, I am very conscious of the benefit of every single euro invested in an effort to redress the economic and socio-economic imbalance in the Union."
"In conclusion, I would welcome any improvements that could be made to the implementation rates for structural-funded programmes and projects."
"We must tackle this by improved forecasting of payment requirements, but I firmly reject any notion that global amounts could in any way be reduced."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say firstly that I find it very regrettable that the other half of the budgetary authority is not present today."
"It would certainly be right and proper for the Council to attend these debates."
"Even though we had a debate on the general principles of the Budget at our last plenary part-session, it would certainly be fitting for them also to be present when we get down to brass tacks - and at Parliament's first reading we really do get down to brass tacks."
"In this respect I am very pleased that we have tabled an amendment which, at least initially, places the funds for the increase in Council staff in the reserve and asks a few more questions."
"I hope that this amendment will also be supported by a sufficient majority."
"It is linked to conditions which the Council can fulfil by the end of the year so as not to jeopardise enlargement."
"I actually wanted to start by thanking the Council for making this morning's Solidarity Fund event such a success and for enabling us to reach an agreement."
"In this context, however, I hope that the Member States concerned, and in particular the German Government, will now also announce their figures quickly."
"We have all made every effort to meet the budgetary conditions."
"We have now met both."
"We have Budget lines, we have a legal base, and now all we need is money."
"If the Commission is still waiting for information in this respect I find it more than shameful."
"It is the end of October and it actually ought to be available."
"I should like to highlight just a few points, because my fellow group members have already addressed a number of issues."
"First, a fundamental comment: it is increasingly clear that the decisions made by the Heads of State and Government in March 1999 on Agenda 2000 and the financial perspective up to 2006 were a wish list of items, which may have been sensible in 1999 but which are no longer relevant to the challenges currently facing the Union."
"I should like to illustrate this using just two figures: if we are able, according to the financial perspective, to spend EUR 42 billion on the agricultural policy but can, after considerable effort, only scrape together a final total of EUR 47 million for common activities under the Common Foreign and Security Policy then this shows an imbalance in our political priorities."
"Europe's activities in Category 4, in particular its support for the peace process in neighbouring countries - an important task whereby we must help to transfer our European legacy of peace to other regions - are on very, very shaky ground."
"The decisions that were made in March 1999 do not help us to meet these obligations in the long term."
"I hope that something can be done here - we have of course tabled various amendments in an effort to shore up this work - and that we will at last be given a better chance to do justice to this important task which is incumbent on the European Union in the twenty-first century."
"Allow me to address a second issue, one on which I also ask for the support of Members from the other groups."
"We have tabled an amendment stating that, in the work on the trans-European networks, special attention should be paid to eliminating bottlenecks to the enlargement countries."
"I would be delighted if a majority of this House could support this."
"We cannot have a situation where enlargement cannot at the end of the day take place in practice."
"It will admittedly happen on paper, but without the necessary infrastructure it will not be able to take place in economic terms."
"The Community is called on to act here."
"We are doing a great deal for those countries wishing to join us, but we must redouble our efforts."
"In order to minimise human suffering and enhance our own credibility, we need to introduce one more correction to the external relations budget."
"It remains extremely regrettable that we are still more than EUR 3 million short on the landmine issue."
"Funds for this cause have already been cut back worldwide."
"The European Union should not take part in this trend."
"Some 50 people, mainly women and children, are still affected every day."
"An enormous amount of money is still required, particularly for the aftercare of the victims and the relatives."
"Moreover, we as Parliament must also meet the commitments entered into in 2001."
"We are now incurring payment arrears while the EU has proven that it can make an effective contribution specifically in this field."
"This is why the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has re-tabled my amendment."
"Our Parliament should recognise that the banning of landmines must also involve non-state players."
"Parliament is adopting a consistent stance by endorsing the amendment."
"A slight increase in the funds will result in a considerable reduction in the number of people suffering."
"Madam President, the exercises in financial engineering required by the current budgetary process demonstrate, once again, the precariousness of the Community financial framework."
"We are not, of course, opposed to the priorities that the rapporteur has outlined. As a matter of fact, I wish to congratulate the rapporteurs on their work."
"We believe, however, that other approaches could be pursued in order to achieve these priorities, without prejudice to and with total respect for the legitimacy and the competences conferred on us, and particularly which would give us an advantage in achieving these very priorities."
"The most important aspect of this situation is the revision of the financial perspective. Or, in the absence of such a revision, the full use of the prerogatives that the Treaties confer on us."
"It is, in fact, unacceptable to maintain and sustain a budget that is clearly inadequate for the set of priorities that we are coming up with."
"Objectively, the means to achieve the ambitions that are being proclaimed are lacking."
"Parliament is constantly losing power and the result is clear to see, especially in heading 4, in which we are seeing a clear and ongoing pressure on cooperation with the least-developed countries, given the inclusion in this category of pre-accession aid for the candidate countries and sums for the reconstruction, first of the Balkans and now of Afghanistan."
"This situation must change."
"Having said this, I should like to say something about a particular case: that of East Timor."
"I shall start by saying that I agree with the sums decided on by the Committee on Budgets."
"I do not agree, however, with eliminating the specific line for that young and much-benighted country."
"This would send a damaging and destabilising political message to a population that gained independence only a few weeks ago and which is still facing all manner of shortcomings."
"This would be a political message that does not, furthermore, tally with the resolutions that we have adopted, or even with the Sakharov Prize that we awarded."
"In addition to which, making funds available under the Asia budget line at a time when the path of future cooperation between East Timor and the European Union has not yet been defined would clearly be an act of rashness."
"I therefore believe it is right and crucial that the situation that has been created should be rectified in plenary."
"Madam President, this budget has just been described as nostalgic, catastrophic and historic."
"I believe it is a sound, well-balanced budget and I would like to thank Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck for their perceptive work."
"I would like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to points which might seem minor but which concern Parliament's use of its power of initiative."
"With due regard for the interinstitutional agreement and the Financial Regulation, the European Parliament is about to vote on new pilot project and preparatory action initiatives, which I believe will be useful for European integration."
"The first point concerns preparing small and medium-sized businesses for enlargement."
"I feel this will be an important signal to industry which will make that network of small businesses which is so vital for our economies feel more involved."
"I am convinced that practical measures would have much more effect than a series of information campaigns."
"The second initiative which I would like to mention concerns a programme known as ENEA, dedicated to the elderly, which seeks to repeat the success of the Erasmus and Socrates programmes in the context of the movement of the elderly."
"The innovative nature of this programme lies in the fact that it could develop as an interface between culture, social policies and health and that, if Parliament endorses the pilot project, it will be providing the Commission with the opportunity to create a programme which will encourage dialogue between elderly people from 25 different countries."
"The last point I would like to mention is the environmental initiative, which, by means of the funding of reforestation measures and the creation of a seed bank, will allow us to promote the mechanism for clean development laid down by the Kyoto Protocol."
"This project seeks to promote positive measures at European level to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, while creating an operative structure for the collection and preservation of seeds and plants, many of which would otherwise be lost as autochthonous species, and the use thereof for the purposes of ecological restoration."
"This will also create employment, for the diversification of farming will certainly pose problems and require new goals to be set."
"The Commission must, of course, now inform Parliament without delay of the measures it intends to take to comply with the recommendations of the budgetary authority if all this is to be put to the vote on Thursday and again in December."
"I would like to thank Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck once again for their work, and I hope that the Commission will continue to seek that close cooperation which we have enjoyed in recent months."
"Madam President, I should like to touch upon quite a small part of the budget, namely that relating to the decentralised agencies, as they are called."
"Two agencies have the problem of being physically situated in countries where the rate of inflation is higher than the EU average, and this erodes their budgets and, therefore, their ability to carry out their tasks."
"One of the agencies is that in Dublin, which is engaged in developing the social dialogue, partly in the candidate countries. The other agency is that in Turin which develops vocational training in the Balkans and within the framework of the MEDA and TACIS programmes."
"The Commission's budgeting does not take account of this problem of inflation, and I believe that more new agencies are at present being established in order to ensure there is the necessary administrative expertise."
"The agencies differ greatly from one another in the ways in which they are set up and in the tasks they have, and I therefore hope that, in the future, we can obtain a budget reading that better takes account of the agencies' different structures and different needs."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we already mentioned some of the priorities of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the 2003 Budget in our debate two weeks ago."
"Today, I should like to concentrate on making a number of comments on the text that we have agreed with the Council on future cooperation in the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"In future negotiations with the Council, the Committee on Budgets is proposing to introduce an institutional mechanism providing for greater parliamentary involvement before the Council makes decisions on foreign policy spending commitments."
"As you know, in recent years we have been repeatedly confronted with the problem - particularly because of the crises in the nineties - of the Council making spending pledges and then Parliament having to find emergency funds from somewhere by cutting the amounts allocated to other foreign policy priorities."
"That is why we want to have a mechanism whereby the Council involves Parliament at an earlier stage, and here we are proposing firstly that Parliament be consulted when possible joint actions are being examined, if necessary on a confidential basis."
"Secondly, we are asking for Parliament to be informed by the chair or representative of the chair of the Political and Security Committee about any mandate and above all about the financial impact of a joint action."
"Thirdly, a joint work plan should be drawn up by the Commission and Parliament setting out priorities for the coming period."
"This is an offer to the Council and only if the outcome is satisfactory will we authorise the funds for the policing mission in Bosnia at second reading."
"Initial indications are very positive and I believe that this is a very important step towards also subjecting the Common Foreign and Security Policy to parliamentary scrutiny in the future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our rapporteurs, Göran Färm und Per Stenmarck, have already produced the broad outlines of our future Budget for 2003."
"Previous speakers have highlighted particular points and added new ones."
"I wish to do the same and highlight one small point, one that Mrs Buitenweg has already mentioned."
"My particular concern, as incidentally has been the case for some time now, is small and medium-sized enterprises and above all micro-enterprises."
"We cannot invent a new priority every financial year, so I am sticking to this one."
"That is why I will also repeat what many of you know, but it will not do any harm to remind you of it again: 99% of all companies in Europe have fewer than 50 employees."
"They employ more than half of all workers and are also responsible for around half of the European Union's entire turnover."
"On average each company employs five people."
"It is small and medium-sized enterprises that are very innovative and growth-driven."
"They therefore play a decisive role in the fight to increase jobs and reduce unemployment."
"That, for a social democrat, is what counts!"
"We are already doing a certain amount at European level to increase the competitiveness of SMEs; let me remind you of the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship."
"However, we want to do even more."
"The project 'SMEs in border regions' should be replaced by a project on 'SMEs and enlargement' and - a number of social democrats have in any case spoken strongly in favour of this - we want a project that helps SMEs to implement the concept of 'Corporate Social Responsibility - a business contribution to sustainable development'."
"So far these proposals have tended to be directed more at the large companies."
"This comes as no surprise: after all they were involved in drafting them."
"We do not consider this to be wrong, far from it, but now we want them to be extended to include guidelines for our small and medium-sized companies."
"We want a pilot project on SMEs and social responsibility."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate the two rapporteurs."
"Every year I am shocked at the huge amount of work they have to do."
"What are my general comments on the budget?"
"It is widely known, also from previous years, that I am a great fan of carrying out what we have agreed as far as possible."
"We should thus remain committed to the financial perspectives."
"This year too, there are a number of budgetary items which go beyond these financial perspectives."
"This is particularly the case in category 4."
"We should, in my opinion, adopt a flexible stance for once."
"As far as the necessary expenditure for Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund is concerned, I believe we should use the flexibility instrument and confer with the Council."
"Whenever I discuss the budget, I cannot help but mention agricultural spending."
"I have once again tabled a host of amendments, and I hope that if they are approved by the plenary, the Council will be prepared to adopt them."
"We currently have an FMD investigation committee, which has made a number of recommendations on which you will be able to vote later on this year."
"However, a number of things are already clear."
"It is unacceptable for us to slaughter animals on a large scale again in the future, as we have done in the past."
"This is why I have tabled amendments for developing better vaccines and better testing methods, distinguishing between infected animals and inoculated animals, and so on. Also, in my opinion - which is incidentally universally endorsed - agricultural production should focus on quality."
"The public, however, should know what quality is."
"Europe needs to develop its own quality system which is readily recognisable to its customers, and funding has been made available for this purpose, provided the system is effective."
"Finally, with regard to the cost of controlling animal diseases, I believe that it is unacceptable for us to earmark a relatively small amount in the budget for this purpose every year, while every year it becomes apparent that if a real epidemic were to break out somewhere, it would cost billions."
"In my view, we need to develop European insurance systems."
"Finally, I have noticed that cooperation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament has been good to date."
"I hope that this will continue to be the case in future."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Budgetary Control Committee, I would also like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, who, I know, have done an immense amount of work on their reports."
"Also the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Terry Wynn, for the way he expedited the votes in some highly-charged discussions recently."
"It is good to get all the work through so rapidly, and I thank him for the way he did that."
"My committee was mainly concerned with four areas."
"The first was OLAF, Europe's anti-fraud office."
"I believe that we have sorted out the problem all the parties in this House had in finding a suitable wording for an amendment about OLAF's funding for the coming year."
"But we still have concerns about the dialogue between the Commission and OLAF in the budget process."
"Realistically, I am particularly worried that it poses questions about OLAF's independence; it is part of the Commission in this process and we can amend its budget in that way."
"The second area was export refunds, something on which Mr Mulder, the previous speaker, is an expert, as is Mr Casaca from the Socialist benches, and a subject I know very little about."
"I understand that they are relatively happy with the outcome of the amendments they tabled in this field."
"Thirdly, we were interested in the protection of the euro against counterfeiting, concerned about the valuation of the euro because so much could have been counterfeited."
"Perhaps we should have been more worried about the bizarre comments by the President of the Commission and tabled an amendment about that."
"Fourthly and more importantly, we were very concerned about the reform agenda within the Commission and that is why I draw the attention of Members across all the parties to the amendments to the Färm Report, especially in relation to Commission reform."
"The Commission's former chief accountant has drawn our attention to a number of concerns about the computer systems and how to ensure that our taxpayers' money, our national governments' money, is being spent correctly if the computer systems used do not support each other or provide proper figures."
"No doubt we shall come back to this in future debates, but those were the main concerns raised by the Budgetary Control Committee."
"Madam President, Commissioner, our wonderful rapporteurs, one of the issues which comes up time and time again in debates on the budget is the proper administration of expenditure."
"That was the case and continues to be so where other areas as well as the Structural Funds are concerned."
"We have received many comments on this issue, almost all of them expressive of indignation but hardly any of them proactive."
"However, a number of solutions have been put forward this, as in past years, including the placing of funds on reserve, and we heard this proposal reiterated just a few minutes ago."
"I believe that this particular medicine would do more harm than the illness, and so I feel that the right direction to take would be that of simplification."
"It has already been said that Commissioner Barnier has set a major project in motion in this field and involved Parliament."
"Proposals have been developed which, if implemented without delay, will make it possible to limit the loss of Structural Funds appropriations by Objective 1 regions."
"However, that is not enough: we need to streamline the all too numerous bureaucratic elements and the endless succession of requests for documentation and controls, and we need a consolidation of funds which responds to the current situation through the integration of development measures."
"This is crucial for enlargement too."
"A stronger Union does not necessarily mean a more ineffective Union - quite the opposite: the simplicity of the rules and the application of the principle of subsidiarity will make the European budget a flexible political and accounting tool which is free from the burden of the RALs, and, most importantly, it will result in a closer, more intimate relationship between the European Union and the citizens."
"Madam President, as I mentioned in the previous plenary session, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs largely welcomed the Council's first reading of the Commission's draft budget."
"It is also true that the committee feels that the EU budget for 2003 is considerably more modest than it has been in recent years."
"As we all know, this is due to the fact that the considerable information initiatives financed by the EU budget ahead of the introduction of the single currency are now behind us."
"However, I will return to this issue in a moment."
"Our committee proposed a very modest number of amendments to the budget and I was greatly disappointed that these were almost entirely rejected by the Committee on Budgets."
"As I said, the requirements were very small and should have been acceptable, particularly in the case of the committee's position and proposal regarding the PRINCE programme and in particular its sub-section B5-3061: information initiatives relating to the single currency."
"There was broad agreement within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the information initiatives should be concentrated on those countries which have not yet introduced the single currency and, to a certain extent, also on candidate countries, which will introduce the single currency one day."
"The fact that this amendment was rejected becomes even more regrettable when we consider that at least one, and perhaps more, of the current Member States is highly likely to hold a referendum on the single currency next year."
"With this in mind, it seems logical that the funds should be earmarked for these countries, rather than being spent on information initiatives of questionable benefit in the countries which have already been highly successful in introducing the single currency."
"It is difficult for me to see what use information measures may have in these countries where the euro is already a reality and part of everyday life."
"As Wim Duisenberg, chairman of the European Central Bank, says, the Central Bank has never had any problem selling its product."
"I share this view and believe that these measures can be taken by each country which has introduced the euro without any contribution from the EU budget."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to express warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Stenmarck."
"He has managed to enshrine our desire for a WTO parliamentary assembly in the budget."
"This is, I believe, a historic act."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is deeply proud that this has been achieved, at least in this reading."
"Secondly, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I should also like to thank Mr Färm very much for his understanding of the problems facing small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in border regions, where I believe that this initiative will be very well received and to which it will offer huge benefits for the future, particularly with a view to enlargement."
"I see a further problem."
"The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy adopted the sixth framework programme of research unanimously."
"Since this was agreed with the Commission and the Council, however, a new problem has arisen."
"On the one hand, we have a development on Basle II that poses a serious threat to the creditworthiness of small and medium-sized enterprises, and at the same time enlargement is imminent and the economy is currently in a very poor state."
"Mr Walter has already said, quite rightly, that we need to strike a balance and that at present things are out of balance."
"We are losing revenue."
