"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mrs Gill's report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the participation by the Community in a research and development programme."
"This programme seeks to enhance the quality of life of older people through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)."
"European Union participation in this programme will ensure that it is better able to address the demographic challenges."
"The use of ICT may help older people to become more independent and to remain healthy, and may enhance their quality of life."
"in writing. - (PT) We voted in favour of this report, which deals with the European Commission proposal on the EU's involvement in the research and development programme that various EU Member States have decided to set up in the field of the new Information Technologies (ICT) to help people as they get older and to enable them to act effectively."
"The programme is entitled 'Ambient Assisted Living', and seeks to obtain synergies in terms of management and financial resources."
"Portugal is also taking part."
"The report, which the European Parliament has now approved, draws attention to and makes concrete proposals for promoting the role of women in science and research, and places stress on the involvement of SMEs and on fair access for all Members States to cost-effective solutions so as to avoid widening the digital divide and thus creating a two tier Europe."
"It is also proposed that the Commission should conduct an interim evaluation by 2010 to assess the quality and efficiency of the implementation of the programme."
"in writing. - (FR) I should like to make two comments on the Gill report, which is essentially about organising research programmes with a view to making older people more independent through the use of information and communication technologies."
"The first point is on the substance of the proposals: it is hard to see what added value the European Union would bring to a project initiated, quite legitimately, by a number of Member States - aside from making the process more bureaucratic and setting up a new Community body."
"The Union's financial largesse, to the tune of EUR 150 million over a number of years minus the operating costs of the aforesaid new body, does not seem like a clinching argument."
"My second point concerns the form of the proposals."
"It is increasingly common for legislative reports to be presented in this House in the form of a compromise between Parliament and the Council - the idea being to speed the process by facilitating their adoption at first reading."
"In effect, however, what we see is the legislative body held hostage by a handful of expert negotiators."
"I regard the spread of this practice as a threat to democracy."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report proposing European Union participation in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) research and development programme that has been undertaken jointly by a number of Member States and third countries."
"Population ageing is a challenge to European society and to Europe's economy."
"Average life expectancy today is 80 years and the number of people in the 65-80 age bracket will increase by approximately 40% between 2010 and 2030."
"New solutions are emerging to help people cope with the memory loss, impaired vision, hearing or mobility and loss of independence which are more likely to afflict us as we age."
"European Union participation in the programme is envisaged in the context of the European Commission's seventh Framework Research and Development Programme."
"The European Union will provide EUR 150 million to cofinance projects that will have a leverage effect worth at least EUR 600 million between 2008 and 2013."
"The countries taking part in the AAL programme are also to help finance it by making an equivalent or greater contribution, which means that each country will invest at least 20% of its national research budget in this field."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of Mrs Gill's report 'Enhancing the quality of life of older people', which aims to promote the use of modern information and communication technology as a means of support for the elderly."
"As we know, our societies are marked by ever-increasing life expectancy."
"That is a very positive trend. The EU average is now 80 years, and the proportion of people in the 65+ age bracket will shortly reach 40%."
"The technologies in question can significantly help such people in various situations, including the prolongation of professional and social activity and improvement of the quality of life."
"Naturally, the specific needs of handicapped people must also be taken into account, and access to these services and technologies must be ensured mainly through the provision of broadband internet connections in both urban and rural areas so as to avoid geographical discrimination."
"in writing. - (DE) I am in favour of cofinancing by the European Union of the 'Ambient Assisted Living' programme, since it would benefit not just older people but also other population groups, such as those with disabilities."
"It is precisely because of the major demographic change in the European population and the rising life expectancy over recent decades that we must support new information and communication technologies that would make it considerably easier for older people to cope with the everyday hurdles facing them."
"In regard to the general cost reduction in the health sector as a result of the use of these new technologies, I would also draw your attention to the research into 'mobile health monitoring' systems, the use of which would reduce annual health costs by EUR 1500 million in Germany alone."
"Let me underline that one of the benefits of cofinancing is that it would also have a positive impact on the private sector, as it would indirectly assist small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I strongly support the AAL Joint Programme because the use of new technologies means continued respect for the private life of older people and allows them to grow old with dignity."
"in writing. - I back Nina Gill's report 'Enhancing the quality of life of older people'."
"In pooling resources and coordinating research and development on a European level we are more adequately able to assess how to improve the lives of our older citizens."
"By setting a minimum contribution we ensure the participation of all Member States in this cause."
"I would like to commend the rapporteur on her report and support the recommendations contained within."
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to support the report in its entirety since, in our view, the EU must prioritise action on unhealthy tax competition in the fuel sector, in particular with a view to enabling the EU to achieve its climate objectives."
"The tax harmonisation proposal would also not prevent individual Member States from raising their CO2 taxes on petrol and diesel."
"This is a further important reason for supporting the report."
"in writing. - (PT) This proposal for a directive seeks to narrow the price differences on fuel among the various Member States that lead to distortions in terms of competition and the environment in road transport activity."
"The difference in prices of gas oil used as motor fuel and unleaded petrol are indeed significant."
"Hence its importance for Portugal, one of the countries in which this situation is making itself felt, bearing in mind the price differences between our country and Spain: Portuguese enterprises suffer competition from Spanish enterprises because the latter benefit from lower fuel prices - fuel representing around 30% of costs - due to lower fuel tax (and VAT)."
"Portuguese enterprises have justified the stagnation of workers' fixed wages by this pressure on costs, with serious consequences for the labour force."
"The European Parliament's proposal is more positive because it eliminates the transitional periods under Article 18, a very important aspect in the current situation, in the hope that it will make it possible to reduce the difference between Portugal and Spain in 2010, since the latter will have to increase its fuel tax from EUR 302 to EUR 330 in the case of gas oil."
"The approximation will continue in 2012 and 2015."
"In the case of unleaded petrol, unfortunately, there will be no change by this means."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against the Schmidt report because what the European Parliament has engaged in here, instead of supporting the Commission initiative, is a sort of conjuring trick playing off the old against the new Member States."
"In any event the decision will ultimately rest with the Ministers alone and it will have to be unanimous."
"in writing. - (FR) Higher taxation and more controls: that is the Brussels recipe for Europe!"
"Harmonising excise duties, just like harmonising VAT by imposing binding minimum rates such as we have had now for 15 years, is demonstrably ineffective, utterly unnecessary and in some cases even damaging."
"Do I need to remind you that measures like this prevent Member States from reducing, for example, VAT in the catering industry, even though that is a sector where the case for distorting cross-border competition is particularly flimsy and where lowering VAT could help to create thousands of jobs?"
"Do I need to remind you that the new Member States are being forced to apply tax increases that their people find quite outrageous, in order to comply with European rules - while at the same time being required, under other European rules, to cut their rates of inflation?"
"The current proposal is to increase tax on diesel in line with tax on unleaded petrol, the pretexts being a desire to protect the environment and an alleged need to combat 'taxation tourism' - by which we mean ordinary people taking advantage of competition!"
"It is all the more scandalous because drivers in a country like France have been encouraged to buy diesel-powered vehicles - presumably so that we can now clobber them harder than ever!"
"in writing. - (PT) This explanation of vote seeks to stress that we are once again wasting an opportunity at EU level - since the mechanism exists - to take action to protect small-scale coastal fishing by failing to apply to petrol at least the same conditions of taxation enjoyed by users of gas oil for farming and fishing."
"It should be remembered that petrol is the fuel used by vessels in this important and largest segment of the various Member States' fleets, notably Portugal's."
"In its 28 September 2006 resolution on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry, the European Parliament, considering that increased fuel prices have a particularly negative effect on the fishing industry - significantly aggravating the existing socioeconomic crisis and drastically reducing fishermen's incomes - and stressing that there is a serious risk of the disappearance of thousands of fisheries enterprises and the loss of thousands of jobs, adopted a range of proposals to support the sector so that it can cope with increased fuel prices."
"A year and a half later, apart from the increase in the 'de minimis' aid, virtually nothing has been done at EU level."
"in writing. - The goal of Olle Schmidt's report 'Taxation of unleaded petrol, gas and oil' is to attend to the disparities in excise duty on fuel across the Union."
"The current imbalance has encouraged fuel tourism, which has economic and environmental ramifications."
"Measures need to be taken to ensure that this practice is discouraged."
"Nevertheless I recognise the needs of new Member States still engaged in the process of economic development, who will require time to adjust to the measures proposed."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (FR) The purpose of the Commission proposal was to introduce measures for reducing CO2 emissions in accordance with the stated aims of the energy and climate change package."
"However, neither the Commission proposal nor the report adopted today addresses the urgent need to develop a fuel capable of making a real difference in the fight against CO2 emissions."
"The disparity of the planned adjustments and the way they are to be spread, both over time and geographically across the Union, will make the proposed measures ineffective."
"If we really intend to move into a 'clean-air era', we ought to be more environmentally imaginative and support measures that will allow us to tackle climate disruption effectively."
"The taxation-change approach proposed by the Commission and by Olle Schmidt's report fails to promote either research or the concept of a new alternative fuel to curb CO2 emissions."
"I want to take a clear stand today in opposition to the thinking behind this report and that is why I voted against what is simply a compromise that subverts the declared aim."
"in writing. - (IT) The Gomes report takes stock of the dramatic and difficult situation in which Iraq finds itself."
"The non-governmental organisations and the various bodies responsible for rebuilding the region are not in practice managing to resolve the problems arising from decades of war, dictatorship and sanctions."
"In this context, it is the duty of the European institutions to support a multi-faceted strategy for Iraq which increases direct EU support for technical assistance to promote the rule of law, justice and sound financial management in order to safeguard fundamental human rights by creating regional stability and security."
"Parliament therefore urges the Council to encourage investment by European enterprises in Iraqi territory, and to conduct the negotiations on the trading agreement between the EU and Iraq so that the Iraqi market can be brought more into line with European regulations."
"In substance, the European Parliament's proposal, with which I fully agree, suggests a new strategy for Iraq including appropriate use of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) and support for a pluralist and independent information system."
"As the Committee on Development's rapporteur for the Erasmus Mundus 2009-2013 report, I shall now work to increase the financial appropriation allocated to Iraq: the dissemination of culture is a fundamental step in creating a genuine rule of law."
"in writing. - (PT) The resolution adopted achieves the 'astonishing' feat of not making a single reference to the brutal and illegal aggression and occupation of Iraq by the USA and its allies."
"The resolution glosses over the whole death toll of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, the destruction of an entire country and the premeditated and massive disrespect for human rights resulting from the aggression and occupation."
"The resolution is completely silent on the first and foremost reason for the extremely serious problems the Iraqi people and their country are now facing, and thus on how to resolve it: the immediate withdrawal of all occupying troops."
"In essence, the resolution endorses the status quo, presenting it as a fait accompli and seeking to promote greater EU participation in the intervention in Iraq, seeing this country as another 'state supervised' by the USA/NATO/EU, like Afghanistan and Kosovo."
"This is astounding, in that at the same time it considers that neighbouring countries must refrain from any interference in Iraq and must respect its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the desire of the Iraqi people to build the country's constitutional and political system by their own efforts."
"Hence our vote against."
"in writing. - I voted for this report, despite the view expressed in one of the recitals that sees all problems in Iraq as being down to the previous regime."
"There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was a vicious dictator and caused the deaths of many of his people, not least in the systematic attempt to wipe out the Kurds."
"However, the total lack of any strategy by the occupying forces to deal with rebuilding the country has also resulted in untold misery."
"I am very pleased, however, that Parliament took the view that no country should be forcibly returning people to Iraq."
"The country is not safe, not even Iraqi Kurdistan, which has recently seen Turkish tanks cross its borders, causing further fear and instability."
"We were told by members of many parties in the Iraqi Parliament that return is dangerous and potentially destabilising for the country itself."
"We have also heard in the Subcommittee on Human Rights of the plight of the millions of Iraqis living as refuges in neighbouring countries with little support from the international community."
"We should support the public services in those states and at least educate the children."
"in writing. - (FR) The representatives of the Movement for France in the European Parliament have taken a consistent stand since the beginning of the US intervention in Iraq."
"Our country's own experience and its ties with the Iraqi people alerted us to the human, military and moral disaster that the intervention would bring."
"Now the damage is done and it is up to the Member States to act, either alone or collectively, to rescue and re-establish whatever can be salvaged."
"Before the US intervention, Iraq was the only Muslim country that was home to a large and prosperous Christian community - a community that had lived there even before the arrival of Islam."
"One of the most tragic consequences of the US intervention has been the exodus of sections of that community, driven out by terror and intimidation."
"It is a calamity for Iraq, today and in the future."
"In the bigger picture, the rapid erosion of a religious population mix in the Middle East spells human and economic impoverishment and threatens the entire region's stability and prosperity."
"The historian Fernand Braudel considered that history began in Sumaria, but it would seem today that the long history of Christian minorities in Iraq is at an end."
"We, the nations of Europe, simply cannot condone this enormous injustice by failing to act."
"Iraqi Christian communities were once open and welcoming to Islam, and together with their Muslim neighbours they built a country that was prosperous before it was ravaged by fanaticism and wars."
"(Explanation of vote cut short under Rule 163)"
"in writing. - I am pleased to see that Ana Gomes' report on the EU's role in Iraq looks forward and formulates a strategy to build a robust democratic Iraqi state that respects human rights and the country's rich ethnic and confessional make-up."
"Iraq needs Europe to help build upon the recent security improvements that will go a long way in encouraging investment and increased NGO involvement in reconstructing the country."
"All of Europe has an interest in a stable and secure Iraq and I feel the report's recommendations recognise this."
"The report is intended to ensure that the EU has a better share in the imperialist booty from the war against Iraq and interventions in the wider region of the Middle East."
"In this context:"
"it seeks ways and means of establishing an EU presence in the country on a long-term basis in order to 'help European firms to bid for contracts to rebuild Iraq', i.e. to increase the share of the spoils received by EU monopolies."
"it calls for unconditional aid to the collaborationist 'government' of Iraq."
"it puts forward strategies for active participation in the imperialist occupation."
"In order for military and police forces to form part of the occupying armies, all that is needed is for different hats to be worn and for the name to be changed to 'UN forces'."
"Therefore, while cynically recognising the catastrophic consequences of the war and the slaughter of the Iraqi people, the report hastily states that events have been wrapped up."
"The report legitimises not only the occupying armies, which it terms a 'Multi-National Force', but even the private firms of murderers active in Iraq, provided that rules are set for their criminal activities!"
"The Communist Party of Greece condemns the report. It expresses its solidarity with the resistance of Iraqis and the struggle of the peoples of the region for liberation from the imperialist yoke of occupation and for their inalienable right to decide their own destinies."
"in writing. - (PT) The fact that Parliament has decided to discuss the future of the European Union's role in Iraq, rather than insisting on a pointless debate on past issues, is positive."
"The five years of importance to us now are the next five years rather than the last."
"The starting point for any debate on this issue must now be to recognise that the situation on the ground has improved significantly, though it is still very serious."
"What that improvement reveals in particular is that there is a viable way forward in the objective of building a democratic and secure state."
"Our objective can be achieved."
"Experience in recent years, however, also shows that it will only be achieved with greater commitment, by increasing security, by investing in training the Iraqi authorities and, very importantly, contributing actively to the creation of infrastructure that will make the country's economy viable, besides oil."
"In the European Union's specific case, this involves investing heavily in the economic reconstruction of Iraq and in building democracy in the country."
"A democratic and safe Iraq that respects human rights is vital for the region and for the world."
"in writing. - (DE) Of course I know that we voted in plenary on the draft report by my colleague Ana Gomes on the role of the European Union and not on her explanatory statement to the report."
"Yet I think it is important that in her explanatory statement the rapporteur once again underlines the fact that the invasion of Iraq was a strategic and humanitarian disaster and that Iraqi society was traumatised afresh by the war and the ensuing chaos and violence."
"I welcome the fact that in addition to all the other important points she makes the rapporteur refers explicitly to the need to ensure that women have a stronger role and to promote respect for the rights of women, minorities and children if good work is to be done in Iraq."
"in writing. - (NL) I find it regrettable that the European Parliament has so far produced no analysis at all of the war in Iraq."
"In recent years Parliament has in fact maintained a deafening silence and not even challenged the lies put out by the Bush Administration."
"For a democratic body like Parliament that matters very much!"
"It will be hard for us to retain credibility if we do not even act against UN Members which flout the UN Charter."
"Mrs Gomes gives us an assessment of the situation in Iraq."
"Her report on the European Union's role in Iraq includes a number of good recommendations for rebuilding the country."
"It addresses a range of subjects and all the measures proposed seem to me to be achievable."
"I particularly welcome the proposals for multilateral efforts, under UN supervision, to get intensive diplomatic talks under way between the US and Iraq's neighbours."
"The aim has to be to establish democracy in Iraq, based on the principles of the rule of law, good governance and human rights."
"So I support the report."
"in writing. - (FR) The Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War stipulates that humanitarian, medical and religious personnel are to be respected and protected."
"It is vital that we support the case of Monsignor Paulos Faraj Rahho, the Chaldean Catholic Archbishop born and resident in Mosul, who was kidnapped on Friday 29 February 2008."
"The three people with him at the time of his abduction were killed by the kidnappers."
"It was not possible, in an oral amendment to the Gomes report, to mention Monsignor Rahho by name."
"For that reason I would ask the President explicitly to send two letters of support and encouragement on Parliament's behalf:"
"one to Iraq's Shiite Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, who has condemned the attacks on Christian clergy and has offered, on behalf of the Iraqi Government, 'protection and justice' for Christians, with an assurance that those responsible for the violence will be hunted down and punished;"
"the other to the Vice-President of Iraq, Tareq al-Hashemi, a member of the Sunni community, who has also denounced terrorist attacks on Christian communities in no uncertain terms and who, following the kidnapping, expressed solidarity with what he called 'our Christian brothers'."
"It is vital that we encourage the national authorities to do all in their power to secure the immediate and unconditional release of Monsignor Paulos Faraj Rahho."
"in writing. - I will be supporting this resolution."
"It is essential as I said in my report from more than a decade ago that we have a binding legal basis for our code of conduct on arms exports."
"Yet the imperative to export is driven by a divided European industry that is desperate for long production so as to enable it to compete with mass-produced armaments from the US with only batch production domestic demand."
"Thus we need to see a single market in defence equipment which will enable Europe to first compete, second to stop feeding regional wars around the world and third move some of its most highly qualified scientists and engineers into the new advanced technology industries of tomorrow."
"in writing. - (SV) Some Member States have a vested interest in the promotion of arms exports."
"Hence, if a common code of conduct for arms exports is drawn up, it is likely that certain Member States with a more restrictive policy may be forced to compromise."
"We take the view that the surveillance of arms exports is best achieved by each Member State working through its national legislation."
"Sweden must continue to have the right to pursue a restrictive policy on arms exports if it so wishes."
"Cooperation is desirable in order to secure further progress in global disarmament work, but this is best achieved on an international basis within the context of the United Nations, having regard to the UN's experience, expertise and global coverage."
"in writing. - (PT) An effective EU code of conduct on arms exports undoubtedly becomes increasingly important in the context of its rapid militarisation, which is mirrored in the draft Treaty currently being ratified in each Member State."
"Not without a certain irony, the resolution itself specifically refers to 'the evolving European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), in which more and more EU military and civilian missions are being deployed (...) where EU personnel might be threatened with arms previously supplied by EU Member States'."
"The 'military equipment market' is expanding in the EU, 'several initiatives to harmonise national arms procurement policies and intra-Community arms transfers and sales' are being encouraged, and there is a 'willingness to increase arms exports as a tool to promote economic interests'."
"The watchword has been given: an arms race and the militarisation of international relations."
"Initiatives and measures seeking at the very least to mitigate such an escalation are therefore positive and necessary."
"As we stated previously, however, arms trade regulation will be much more significant if it is accompanied by a process of multilateral and reciprocal disarmament, beginning in particular by dismantling the huge nuclear arsenals."
"in writing. - The British Conservative Delegation voted against the resolution on the basis that it does not accept the references to the Lisbon Treaty or to the evolving ESDP, both of which it opposes."
"Furthermore, while it is strongly in favour of a responsible arms transfer policy, it is not convinced of the merits of a legally binding Code of Conduct, imposed by the EU, in advance of an internationally binding Arms Trade Treaty."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted for the report since it is important that prison conditions be improved in certain institutions in Europe and that prisoners' human and fundamental rights be respected."
"Furthermore, an equality perspective must be integrated into the treatment of offenders and prison operation."
"However, we have certain objections to some of the content of the report."
"We do not want harmonisation of prison conditions in Europe and we have strong misgivings over references in the report to special criminal sanctions or alternative penalties for women, pregnant women and women with young children."
"As regards a child's contact with its parents during periods of custody and thereafter, account should be taken, with the focus on the child's best interests, of both parents and not just the mother or the one parent."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues believe that ways should always be looked at to improve the situation of women in prison."
"The report suggests a number of possibilities that could be explored further, including the provision of health services."
"However, the report is overly prescriptive in what it asks of Member States in this area."
"It is for Member States to decide on the details of prison policy."
"In particular, we are unable to agree with the premise of Recital C and Recital Q, which we believe distort other aspects of the report that may have value."
"For these reasons, we have decided to abstain."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's report on the particular situation of women in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life, since there is evidence that European prisons are geared largely towards male prisoners and overlook women's specific needs."
"I therefore believe that measures should be adopted to promote the improvement of the situation of women prisoners, particularly in terms of their social and professional reintegration, health care and hygiene, psychological support and the preservation of family ties."
"in writing. - (PT) Although women represent around 4.5 to 5% of the prison population in the European Union, prisons continue to be geared basically towards male prisoners and tend to overlook the specific problem of the small but growing percentage of women prisoners."
"The principal areas of concern are health care, the situation of imprisoned women with children and professional and social reintegration."
"Specific attention should be paid to women's health care and hygiene needs. Pregnant women prisoners in particular require specialised resources and attention in respect of diet, exercise, clothing, medication and medical care by specialised personnel."
"Children who remain with their imprisoned mothers require adequate protection and care and should not suffer from any form of discrimination."
"Imprisonment of women can have particularly grave implications when they have been the sole carers of their children prior to imprisonment."
"Social inclusion of prisoners must be prepared during and after imprisonment with the cooperation of social services and other relevant organisations in order to ensure a smooth transition from prison to liberty."
"in writing. - (SV) We support the work being done in the Member States to modernise and adapt penal policy in order to make better provision for the needs of prisoners and, as part of this, to take account of the specific needs of women."
"As the treatment of offenders does not fall under the powers of the EU, we have chosen to vote against the report."
"Measures concerned with visiting regulations, the operation of institutions, training of staff in the penal system, prisoners' leisure activities or social assistance are and should remain a matter for the Member States, so that they can be adapted and developed in accordance with national and local needs."
"in writing. - (SV) Junilistan sympathises with many of the report's views concerning respect for human rights, better conditions in prisons, respect for equality between women and men and the importance of the resettlement of offenders in society."
"Clearly it is also immensely important that the greatest possible consideration be given to the needs of the child in these situations."
"However, we think that the Member States themselves should determine how they are to proceed in dealing with these matters."
"In particular, we stress the right of every Member State to formulate its own criminal law and hence also to pronounce appropriate sentences."
"Also, the European Union should not involve itself in the detailed regulation of whether a prison should have a gym or not, visiting regulations or work during custody."
"These things should be subject to the direction of the Member States and their voters and be determined by the public debate in society."
"We would remind everyone that all the EU Member States are democratic states complying with the Copenhagen criteria."
"in writing. - (SV) We support the work being done in the Member States to modernise and adapt penal policy in order to make better provision for the needs of prisoners and, as part of this, to take account of the specific needs of women."
"As the treatment of offenders does not fall under the powers of the EU, we have chosen to vote against the report."
"Measures concerned with visiting regulations, the operation of institutions, training of staff in the penal system, prisoners' leisure activities or social assistance are and should remain a matter for the Member States, so that they can be adapted and developed in accordance with national and local needs."
"in writing. - I agree with the findings outlined in Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's report on the situation of women in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life."
"Prison remains orientated towards the needs of male prisoners and I welcome the report's aim to highlight the differences experienced by women."
"I endorse the report."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report because there is an urgent need to adapt conditions of imprisonment to address women's specific needs."
"Even today, prison conditions in many Member States remain very poor and are certainly not geared to providing the particular types of support that women require."
"There are specific issues for women prisoners that demand specific attention, notably in the matter of access to healthcare."
"That is why I supported the amendment tabled by the Socialist Group calling for women prisoners to have the same access as other women to screening programmes for breast cancer and cervical cancer."
"The fact is that early diagnosis of these conditions improves the chances of curing them, so the denial of access to such screening programmes can effectively impose an additional penalty on female prisoners."
"Furthermore, women are still central to the family unit."
"In the case of mothers, provided that they pose no threat to public order, we should therefore try to facilitate forms of punishment other than imprisonment, wherever possible."
"in writing. - (SV) This is an area for which there are no powers at EU level."
"Despite some positive proposals, the report is too concerned with detailed regulation."
"I therefore abstain in the vote."
"in writing. - When voting for any policy which includes the term 'sexual and reproductive health' we understand this to mean the protection and enhancement of the life and health of the mother and the unborn."
"We do not accept any other definition that infers abortion to be within this term; and furthermore we understand that any care, information, policies or any other services pertaining to sexual and reproductive health similarly exclude abortion."
"We will work to have this definition accepted at every forum and body we can influence."
"We note the reply given by the Council Presidency in Parliament on 4 December 2003 that the term reproductive health does not include the promotion of abortion and, inter alia, that abortion should never be presented as a method of family planning, contrary to what the WHO states on fertility regulation."
"It is clear, therefore, that the WHO definition is not binding on or even accepted by governmental and parliamentary institutions."
"We will continue to support policies to promote responsible sexual practices, and to protect and enhance the life and health of the mother and the unborn, including supporting the provision of resources to achieve these objectives."
"in writing. - (SV) This own-initiative report seeks to integrate the equality perspective into the EU's development cooperation."
"Junilistan is opposed to aid at EU level and is therefore voting against the report."
"However, several of the amendments which have been tabled by certain Members are of a less congenial nature."
"The right of women to sexual and reproductive health is an important element in promoting development."
"In this case, we have chosen to support the original proposals as a counterbalance to the disagreeable tendencies in this Parliament."
"Work on these questions and development cooperation, however, should in principle be pursued at global level through the UN, not the EU."
"in writing. - (PT) We consider this report to have several merits, one of which is to draw attention to a major problem, both in the EU and in developing countries: the need to ensure access to information on sexual and reproductive health, to ensure freedom of decision, and to create and promote public services to protect and apply the rights of everyone, particularly women."
"We believe that it should be emphasised, however, that the greatest contribution to 'gender equality and women's empowerment in development cooperation' will come not from policies that promote relationships of dependency and domination, market liberalisation (see the EU Economic Partnership Agreements - EPA), the exploitation of workers, inequalities and social injustice and disrespect for human rights, which afflict millions and millions of children and women in particular, but from a policy of effective cooperation based on equal rights between states, respect for national sovereignty and the right of each country to define and implement a development model that meets its people's needs and concerns, i.e. a policy that interprets the word 'solidarity' accurately."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this amendment, because I strongly believe that fighting against violence, in this case sexual violence against women in crises and conflict areas, has to be the highest priority."
"The EU cannot tolerate any kind of violence and therefore I find that the emphasis should be on fighting against sexual violence targeted against women."
"Furthermore I think that traditions are not to be seen as something evil."
"Sexual and reproductive health and rights are sensitive issues, including traditional societal and also religious dimensions, and therefore should not be generalised and thereby forced upon societies, especially fragile societies, where drastic changes in traditional ways of living can harm the fragile society more than they bring benefits."
"in writing. - (DE) I vote for gender equality and the empowerment of women in development cooperation."
"The way women in developing countries are disadvantaged by religious rules, cultural practices and poverty is usually further worsened by the lack of education."
"In that regard I want in particular to draw attention to the potentially enormous social pressure that could come from raising public awareness of women's basic rights, which could in the final analysis improve the situation of women in the regions concerned."
"I further support the idea of regarding 'violence against women' not purely in terms of female victims but of also developing practical programmes addressing the 'male abusers' aspect, as proposed in Mrs Uca's report."
"I too am highly critical of the Commission's failure to include a strategy against culture- or religion-based violence against women in its list of measures."
"Poor access to education leads to disadvantages in other areas of life for the simple reason of lack of information."
"To be poorly informed in this respect can have lethal consequences in developing countries in which health provision and standards of hygiene are often appalling."
"I need only refer to the alarmingly high percentage of HIV-infected women - south of the Sahara the figure is 57%."
"One extremely positive point is the call for 'gender-sensitive performance indicators' to be developed, which would also make the controversial subject of quotas less acrimonious."
"in writing. - When voting for any policy which includes the term 'sexual and reproductive health' I understand this to mean the protection and enhancement of the life and health of the mother and the unborn."
"I do not accept any other definition that infers abortion to be within this term; and furthermore I understand that any care, information, policies or any other services pertaining to sexual and reproductive health similarly exclude abortion."
"We should work to have this definition accepted at every forum and body we can influence."
"I note the reply given by the Council Presidency in Parliament on 4 December 2003 that the term reproductive health does not include the promotion of abortion and, inter alia, that abortion should never be presented as a method of family planning, contrary to what the WHO states on fertility regulation."
"It is clear, therefore, that the WHO definition is not binding on or even accepted by governmental and parliamentary institutions."
"I will continue to support policies to promote responsible sexual practices, and to protect and enhance the life and health of the mother and the unborn, including supporting the provision of resources to achieve these objectives."
"in writing. - Feleknas Uca's report 'Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Development Cooperation' welcomes the Commission's strategy on the issue."
"I reiterate this approval of a strategy that seeks to mainstream gender equality in development cooperation."
"I have voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (FR) While gender equality has been an integral part of the European Union's development cooperation programmes for many years now, actual progress is still too slow."
"The European Commission therefore needs to set itself targets, in terms of figures and deadlines, so that development can become the main driver of improved living conditions for women."
"To that end, the Union needs to focus on three priorities in the partnerships that it enters into: fundamental freedoms, women's status in public life and their access to healthcare."
"On the one hand, the Commission needs to be more vigilant than ever with regard to violations of women's physical integrity and human dignity (in the form of torture, traditional practices of mutilation and forced marriage)."
"At the same time, cooperation must entail recognition of women's place in society, which affects everything from access to knowledge through to financial independence."
"In addition, commitments are needed so that by 2010 the prevention and treatment of AIDS in developing countries will be a reality."
"European development policy will fall flat on its face if it cannot bring about genuine change in women's circumstances."
"The report, despite its accurate findings on the tragic state of women in developing countries, conceals what is to blame: capitalist production methods and the brutal imperialist interventions by the EU, the United States and other imperialist states and organisations."
"The solutions proposed operate within the bounds of capitalist development and the EU's developmental aid."
"Another typical aspect of this approach is the proposal to reinforce female entrepreneurship in order to increase employment."
"In this context, the proposals for fairer and more democratic societies, access for girls and women to education and health services, the eradication of poverty, disease, etc., are hot air."
"They are mere wishes diverting attention away from the truth, because meeting the people's needs is incompatible with the supreme principle of capitalist development and the pursuit of profit."
"For every euro that the EU gives, it steals thousands from these countries."
"The improvement of the position of women and the living conditions of the peoples of these countries will be achieved not through the legalised robbery of 'EU developmental aid', but through resistance to imperialist intervention, the quest for equal international relations and the struggle for a different developmental approach based on the needs of the people."
"in writing. - (DE) This report on equality and participation, on the role of women in development cooperation, covers a great number of different aspects and also includes important practical demands."
"As a whole, therefore, it should definitely be supported."
"One theme that runs through the entire report is sexual and reproductive health and violence against women, together with promoting women's right to self-determination."
"It is important to expand the micro-financing networks, because micro-credits can help improve women's economic situation."
"I cannot understand why people are trying to table various draft amendments that weaken the report and are simply dismissing UN documents that are on hand."
"in writing. - Mr President, I am all in favour of gender equality and empowering women and I would have liked to support this positive report."
"Sadly, this report, like many others on women and children, has been used to promote abortion under sexual and reproductive rights."
"As the majority of my colleagues have voted to include a number of amendments on sexual and reproductive rights, I found myself unable to vote in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (PL) The Uca report on gender equality in development policy is an expression of European moral imperialism vis-à-vis the developing countries."
"It exports the sick social model of the rich European countries to the countries of Africa and Asia."
"The repeated references to reproductive rights denote support for generalised abortion."
"I was therefore unable to vote in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (FR) Equality between men and women is a priority in developing countries."
"I greatly appreciate the thorough and painstaking work that Mrs Uca has done on this important subject."
"Nonetheless, I voted against the report because the substance of certain paragraphs in the final version, which refer to sexual and reproductive health in imprecise terms, remains ambiguous."
"Conflicting interpretations persist and some of them imply a threat to the lives of unborn children."
"In the next report on the subject, women's health should not be seen solely in relation to reproduction, for all women have the right to an environment that allows them to enjoy continuing good health."
"That means paying particular attention to supplies of safe drinking water, proteins and basic medication, alongside traditional medicines."
"Since Gertrude Mongella's visit on 6 March 2008, marking International Women's Day, I would also say that we have a lot to learn from African wisdom with regard to gender equality: it is something that is lived there and is passed on in oral traditions among women and men who are blessed with good spiritual and mental health."
"All of us could take inspiration from that."

"1."
"Armenia"
"The next item is the debate on five motions for a resolution on Armenia."
"author. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, will the tragic events that have occurred in Armenia since the presidential election on 19 February 2008 send out the message that Europe is incapable of supporting the fragile little democracies of the South Caucasus in their struggle to become established?"
"Following the crisis in Georgia, it is now Armenia's turn to suffer major political upheaval."
"Despite the high level of attention directed at the country during the election campaign, the international community failed to promote the dialogue that might have prevented the clashes on 1 March."
"After 11 days of protest against the election results by the opposition movement under former head of state Levon Ter-Petrosian, police tried to disperse the demonstrators."
"The situation degenerated, resulting in the deaths of eight people, injuries to many others and the imposition of a state of emergency with curbs on freedom of information and freedom of assembly, as well as restrictions on political parties."
"Since then, 400 people have been arrested."
"There is an evident mood of anxiety among the population, who fear that a policy of repression will be imposed."
"We have a duty today, in our contacts with all the parties involved in the Armenian conflict, to reflect that fear."
"The question, however, is what we should propose as a method of bringing all sides to their senses and getting them to the negotiating table against the current backdrop of heightened tension?"
"That is the challenge."
"We need to restore the confidence of ordinary Armenian men and women in their fledgling democracy."
"Essential preconditions for restoring confidence are the setting up of an inquiry into the recent events and the release of those imprisoned."
"The next step - in conjunction with the international community, our Special Representative to the South Caucasus and our partners in the Council of Europe and the OSCE - must be to fix a timescale for our Armenian friends to return to the negotiating table, and we must bring all the conflicting parties to the table, on both the official and the opposition sides."
"The rules of democracy depend upon dialogue and non-violence and it is up to us to facilitate such an approach."
"With your permission, Mr President, I should like to propose an oral amendment."
"I am not sure how to proceed for the fact is that we made a mistake in the resolution."
"In recital H we referred to the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh where we should have said the status of Nagorno-Karabakh."
"It would seem that my colleagues agree with the oral amendment."
"author. - Mr President, I was one of the four Members of the European Parliament election observation mission in Armenia and I fully agree with and endorse its findings concerning the presidential elections, namely that the election was mostly in line with the OSCE and the Council of Europe commitments and standards."
"The state authorities made genuine efforts to address shortcomings noted in the previous elections."
"Allow me to use this opportunity to thank the Commission's delegation in Yerevan for all the assistance provided to us."
"The election was mostly in line with our standards, as I said, but further improvement and political will are required to address remaining challenges."
"I express my deep regret and concern at recent developments that have taken place in Armenia, with violent clashes between police and opposition demonstrators that led to the death of eight citizens and over 100 injured."
"It goes without saying that we expect a transparent and independent investigation of the events that took place and the partial lifting of the state of emergency which was imposed after the event."
"Even though it is a step in the right direction, it is not enough."
"I call on the Armenian authorities to carry out a full lifting of the state of emergency."
"On behalf of my group, I call upon all parties involved to show openness and calmness, to tone down statements and to engage immediately in a constructive dialogue."
"Last but not least, we regret and we are concerned at the recent unprecedented violation of the ceasefire on the line of contact with Nagorno-Karabakh and we strongly urge the parties to refrain from any actions that could undermine the negotiation process."
"We urge them to stay away from the loud and catastrophic power of arms, and we call upon them to exercise the silent and peaceful power of dialogue."
"author. - Mr President, recent events in Armenia show how difficult it is for fledgling democracies in the former Soviet Union to trust the electoral process."
"Those who hold power are tempted to stack the cards in their favour, especially in the run-up to elections, whilst those who lose find the results difficult to accept."
"The problems we have seen in post-election Armenia have been compounded by violent clashes, resulting in eight fatalities, and by the imposition of an extraordinary measure in the form of a state of emergency."
"Bans on all political activities and strict censorship of the media were imposed on 1 March 2008 for a 20-day period."
"The ban on political activities has subsequently been lifted."
"Media freedom, including unrestricted internet access, is to follow."
"Indeed, all normal constitutional freedoms should be restored next week."
"Unfortunately, it cannot be ruled out that the state of emergency will be extended."
"For now, a lid has been put on the pressure-cooker."
"I am concerned about what is being done to release the source of the pressure."
"Building democracy is a complex process. It must be safeguarded by institutions in which all parties place their trust."
"It is, therefore, regrettable that the outgoing President has attacked his country's human rights ombudsman, who criticised government actions."
"It is only by strengthening the role of the ombudsman and also by ensuring impartiality of the constitutional court, which investigates allegations of electoral fraud, that democracy can be protected."
"Until there is faith in Armenia's own guardians of democracy, I strongly urge all parties in the dispute to make use of the mediation offered by the EU and the OSCE envoys and to do so immediately."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, in presidential elections we increasingly see continuing uncertainty as to whether the preferred candidate of the ruling government has actually won a true majority of the votes as well as just a large number of votes."
"Even where that candidate does have a true majority, doubts remain about the size of that majority, certainly where manifest attempts have been made to inflate it artificially."
"When, in addition, some candidates are prevented from standing, when only the government-endorsed candidate has access to press, radio and television, when the opposition or foreign observers are not able to monitor the count properly, when peaceful protests against the officially declared results are broken up by army and police and opposition leaders are arrested, there is every reason for very serious doubt that the will of the electorate has been upheld."
"We have seen controversial presidential elections of this kind outside Europe in Mexico and Kenya, and within Europe in Belarus, Russia, Georgia and Armenia."
"Even without these elections Armenia was in an extremely difficult position."
"Traditionally it has strong ties with Russia but is separated from it by neighbouring Georgia, which has a serious conflict with Russia, and neighbouring Azerbaijan, which has for many years had a border dispute with Armenia."
"When the Russian province of Transcaucasia was divided up along ethnic lines in the 1920s the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, populated by Armenians, was given to Azerbaijan by way of a compromise, with a guarantee of regional Armenian autonomy."
"That solution is no longer workable in the post-Soviet era, since the two states of Azerbaijan and Armenia are now enemies."
"In fact the territory is currently occupied by Armenia, and this has led to a protracted conflict with its eastern neighbour, though a ceasefire is in force."
"This kind of situation, with a permanent threat of war and blockades, provides fertile ground for authoritarian government to flourish and it is unremittingly difficult for democracy to function in the country."
"The events since the 19 February elections come as no surprise."
"Even so we must make every effort to get democratic conditions restored and the rights of the opposition reinstated."
"The wishes of the European Union or its Member States for good relations with the de facto rulers of countries like Russia, Belarus, Georgia or Armenia must take second place behind this prime imperative."
"author. - Mr President, Armenia is essentially a relatively recently re-born country, struggling to strengthen its democratic institutions and safeguard the well-being of its citizens whilst squashed between two not-so-democratic but rather hostile neighbours, namely Russia and Turkey, and whilst being disturbingly and unfairly involved in a territorial conflict with the totalitarian regime of Azerbaijan."
"In this setting, the recently-held presidential elections were not perfect, but in the words of the international observation mission, were 'administered mostly in line with OSCE and Council of Europe [...] standards'."
"Sadly, in post-election protests it would appear that the police used more than necessary force, which resulted in the death of eight people, including one policeman."
"A thorough and fair investigation is called for into the events that led to these deaths."
"An investigation is also warranted into allegations that external forces are instigating violence in Armenia in order to destabilise the country."
"I call for full support for this resolution."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, it goes without saying that we would like Armenia to be at peace, to have secure borders and to manage its external affairs successfully."
"May I remind you that the elections in Armenia gave rise to no serious protests. What is happening there today must be seen in the specific context of the Caucasus, a highly inflammable region."
"While I have the floor, Mr President, I would, with your permission, take this opportunity to voice my outrage at the news I have just received of the murder of Faraj Rahho, the Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul."
"He was abducted on 29 February and three of his bodyguards were shot."
"This is a further attack, a further crime, by men who lack the courage to show their faces to the world, who kidnap innocent victims, ordinary people pursuing religious activities - mostly Christians, mostly Catholic Christians."
"Today we are again witnesses of such a crime, and it seems to me this matter should be placed on the agenda of our next meeting in Brussels as a special item."
"May the Lord grant eternal rest to the heroic martyr who died today in Mosul."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (RO) What happened in Armenia must be vehemently condemned but unfortunately it was not a surprise."
"There are other quite similar events in another country in that area and they represent a continuation of the situation in place after 1990."
"We are facing the consequence of several factors persisting from then to the present day: insufficient economic development, latent conflicts, and the influence of the Russian Federation."
"On top of all that we have the situation in Kosovo which, despite all considerable but useless efforts of the authors, will form a precedent for all those interested."
"For the population in the region, it can only result in insecurity, lack of confidence in the authorities, and vulnerability to manipulation."
"There is only one solution to restore a state of normality: economic development that will generate a higher standard of living."
"There are energy resources."
"The development of such resources and of their transit will solve the problem of economic development, as well as that of independence from the Russian Federation and it will also solve Europe's problem in general."
"The European Union did not really take a stand and if we want to find solutions to the problems in the Southern Caucasus, the Union must take active steps in the development of energy routes in the Black Sea region."
"When a country that participates in the European Neighbourhood Policy and is favourably disposed towards the EU holds a successful democratic election, it is a victory for us as well."
"If it goes wrong, it is a case of mutual defeat."
"The Presidential election in Armenia was conducted in line with international standards, according to the international observation mission."
"Alas, subsequent developments cancel this unsteady step forward."
"Bloodshed and the imposition of a state of emergency have swept Armenia off the road to democracy, impeding its relations with the European Union."
"Human rights are suppressed in Armenia and there is no freedom of speech."
"Yerevan should lift the state of emergency entirely and the OSCE representative should assist in finding a solution to the crisis."
"Hopefully, both negotiating parties will show moderation and will base their work on European values."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the present political crisis in Armenia is not the first."
"During the presidency of Levon Ter-Petrosian the country began to depart sharply from liberal and democratic standards."
"The main opposition parties were banned, freedom of the press was restricted, and parliamentary elections were generally recognised as not meeting all democratic criteria."
"Mr Ter-Petrosian resigned as president under the pressure of demonstrations. That brought some stability to the country, but it was ended by the dramatic murder in parliament of nine leading Armenian politicians, including the prime minister, by unknown assassins."
"We are now seeing a repeat of what happened some 10 years ago."
"The present crisis, however, may perhaps be due to the weariness of Armenian society with the governments of the so-called Karabakh Clan, to which both the former and the present president belong."
"The government is widely accused of restoring authoritarian rule under the guise of democracy, with mafia-type control of business activities and a deteriorating economy."
"There is also a growing fear of Armenia's increasing isolation and the gradual weakening of its position in the unresolved conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh."
"When Mr Ter-Petrosian decided to return to politics and stand for election, his promise of greater flexibility in foreign policy won him considerable support."
"The present crisis is very deep, however."
"Let us hope it will be resolved by political means, although that is not at all certain."
"If not, the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh may be stepped up in an attempt to unite society around the government."
"A recent incident in Karabakh in which 11 people died confirms this fear."
"Another result may be a further strengthening of Armenia's increasing dependence on Russia. The recent inauguration of the Armenia-Iran pipeline will not weaken that dependence, since the gas, and the pipeline itself, will of course be controlled by Gazprom."
"Our attitude to the serious situation in Armenia should be friendly, but we should not refrain from criticism or from expressing concern where necessary."
"I believe the position proposed in this resolution meets those criteria."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the outcome of the presidential election of 19 February 2008 was a factor in the political destabilisation of Armenia, although it should be emphasised that the conduct of the election was recognised by the OCSE as complying with democratic standards."
"The demonstrations following the placing of Levon Ter-Petrosian under house arrest and their brutal repression on 1 March ended with eight people dead, many others injured, and the declaration of a state of emergency."
"Restrictions on the media and the arrest of more and more members of the opposition are causing serious concern."
"We call on the Armenian authorities to restore civil rights without delay, end the state of emergency, respect human rights and determine who was responsible for the tragic events of 1 March 2008."
"Investigation of this matter must not be a pretext for further persecution of the opposition."
"The situation in Armenia is very difficult indeed, and our representatives must pay great attention to it."
"Mr President, I should like to add that the democratic standards in Armenia are not as we would like to see them."
"What aggravates the situation is the socioeconomic situation, and this, naturally, brings additional people to the street."
"I would like to appeal both to the Armenian authorities and, of course, to Azerbaijan to endeavour to settle this long-lasting conflict."
"There are areas occupied by Armenia which should be freed because there are no Armenians there."
"What is really worrying is that both countries are in the process of rearmament, which, of course, reflects the situation as to the real social problems facing the countries, particularly Armenia."
"Therefore, I support this joint motion for a resolution, but I think we should continue to follow the situation very closely, because it is worrying."
"(PL) Mr President, Armenia is one of a group of countries that receive support from the European Union for introducing political and economic reforms, establishing the institutions of a state governed by the rule of law, and combating corruption and organised crime."
"We are therefore right to keep the political process and respect for democratic principles in that country under scrutiny."
"That is especially important in view of the changes taking place in Armenia since the collapse of the Soviet Union."
"Governments very often seek to influence the media, but when they resort to violence and the use of force they must be opposed with exceptional determination. And when there are fatal victims, the situation is exceptionally difficult."
"We categorically demand the restoration of freedom, respect for other views, and the maintenance of democracy and civil rights."
"We condemn the use of force and the violent dispersal of democratic meetings, protests and demonstrations."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission keeps a particularly close watch on the situation with regard to democracy and human rights in Armenia, which, as you know, is one of our partners under the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"We follow developments there attentively through the intermediaries of our delegation in Yerevan, with the Member States, and in close cooperation with the European Union Special Representative, Peter Semneby."
"As part of the process, we are also in regular contact with local and international NGOs working in the fields of democracy and human rights."
"In relation to the tragic events that occurred in Yerevan on 1 March in the aftermath of the election, the Commission shares the general concern over the violent clashes between police and opposition demonstrators, which resulted in a number of deaths."
"The Commission has therefore called for the immediate establishment of a thorough investigation and for the prosecution of persons who broke the law."
"We have also called on the Armenian Government to lift the state of emergency immediately."
"The Commission believes it is important that all sides should refrain from using force."
"We expect all parties in Armenia to commit to political dialogue as the means of overcoming their differences."
"At the same time, the Commission also deplores the shadow cast by the recent events on Armenia's increasingly positive progress towards implementation of its ENP action plan, particularly in the areas of human rights and democracy."
"The call to pursue political reform and to respect human rights is an integral element of the partnership between the European Union and Armenia, and the Commission will therefore use every means at its disposal to encourage the Armenian authorities to forge ahead in those areas."
"By adopting the joint EU-Armenia ENP Action Plan in 2006, we acquired a policy tool for promoting the observance of principles based on our shared values."
"We are firmly convinced that an ongoing dialogue with Armenia, conducted in accordance with the policy provisions of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the ENP Action Plan, is indeed the most effective means of conveying the European Union's messages about respect for human rights and international law."
"The annual meetings of the Cooperation Committee and Cooperation Council, and of the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee are thus particularly important."
"The Commission also remains determined to contribute to the reform process by providing Armenia with financial and technical assistance."
"Supporting political reform in the areas of human rights and democracy continues to be a priority in the national indicative programme for 2007-2010."
"Approximately a third of our bilateral aid - which will amount over that period to EUR 98.4 million - will be used to assist relevant projects."
"More specifically, the 2007 bilateral aid programme with Armenia is targeting financial support in the field of judicial reform, to the tune of EUR 18 million."
"I am sure that the European Parliament will back us in that effort and, indeed, will be our staunchest ally."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"2."
"Russia"
"The next item is the debate on five motions for a resolution on the arrest of demonstrators following the presidential election in Russia."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, in the run-up to drafting this resolution, some of us were accused of being enemies or opponents of Russia."
"We are just the opposite!"
"We are friends of Russia, we are concerned about democracy and the rule of law in this important European country."
"We protest vehemently against the imprisonment of opposition activists who did no more than draw attention to a fact that has been noted by all international institutions, namely that the presidential elections in Russia were extremely unfair."
"We call for the immediate release of the opposition activists and of others who have been held in prisons and work camps for a long time, like the so-called Yukos prisoners Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, and I support Chancellor Merkel's call for the two men finally to be released."
"We must, however, be quite clear about one thing."
"The newly elected President of Russia has the unique opportunity to make a new beginning, to move towards democracy and the rule of law and towards a less nationalistic and aggressive foreign policy."
"That means, however, that he will have to extricate himself from the coils of Gazprom and free himself from the Putin system; sadly, there is not the least indication of that."
"That is why it is our duty to voice honest criticisms."
"It is not those who, like former German Chancellor Schröder, sing the praises of the Putin system and allow themselves to become involved in the propaganda and in the economic and nationalistic interests of that system, who are Russia's friends; no, Russia's friends support the human and civil rights of the Russian people, who have a chance of democratic development."
"If we remain silent, the small seeds of democracy and the rule of law that President Yeltsin sowed and that President Putin has endangered will finally be suffocated, and that cannot be in the interest of Europe or in the interest of the Russian people."
"(Applause)"
"author. - Mr President, I am talking in a personal capacity on this matter."
"In recent years significant changes have been occurring in Russia, from Stalinist Communism to the beginnings of liberal capitalism; from the nuclear threat of the Cold War to the initiation of friendly disarmament and military cooperation talks with the West."
"At the same time, more democratic reforms in the country have been instituted and the standard of living of the Russian people has been increasing steadily."
"We welcome these changes and must support them."
"We do not always have to be critical of the bad things; we sometimes have to condone and support the good things."
"In this way, we will not only be objective but we will encourage changes for the better to a faster and greater extent."
"With these thoughts in mind, and looking at the recent presidential elections in Russia, we have to say that these were held in a more democratic fashion than previously, although there was still the problem of unequal access of candidates to the media."
"But, let us be honest, is this a problem we do not have ourselves in the EU Member States?"
"Unfortunately, we do."
"Following the elections, there were protests in the streets."
"It was reported that some of these protests were met with disproportionate force by the Russian police."
"Can we honestly say that our own police forces in EU Member States or candidate member states are angels and do not sometimes - more often than we would like - use disproportionate force?"
"Yes, we condemn the unfair treatment of candidates by the Russian state-run media; yes, we condemn the undue use of force by the Russian police against protesters, but we do so in exactly the same way and with the same spirit as we would when dealing with similar happenings in any other country or union of countries, including our own."
"Mr President, I have to disappoint you."
"I am not the author of this resolution and my group did not co-sign the resolution."
"The reason why my group did not do so is not to avoid having a discussion today."
"It is not because we think that we do not need to discuss these matters and not because we think there are no problems in Russia, nor is it because we think we do not need to address the implications of the Russian presidential elections, but rather it is because we strongly believe that, when we are dealing with Russia - a world player, a member of the UN Security Council and one of the major partners of the EU - we need an extensive and well-prepared plenary debate to take place."
"Russia is not only a close neighbour for us, it is also a strategic partner."
"We want to have a broad debate on our relationship where all significant issues will be addressed, from trade to investment - which is booming - and energy, democracy, and also human rights."
"There are many different opinions on Russia, but I think everybody agrees that Russia is a key partner for us in tackling regional conflicts and global challenges, and that much remains to be done to develop the full potential of our relationship."
"We need to be able to have an extensive exchange of views in this House, but also with the Commission and Council, on how to formulate a pragmatic approach cooperating in issues where we can, and disagreeing on issues where we cannot cooperate."
"It is more than obvious that it is not possible or appropriate to deal with this significant and important issue in a time slot of 20 minutes on a Thursday afternoon, and this is the reason why my group cannot support the draft resolution and the reason why my group will abstain in the vote later on."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, there has been another election in Russia, and once again many candidates were eliminated before the vote."
"Once again opposition activists protesting against the result of the election were forcibly dispersed."
"And once again the West is surprised, on three accounts. First, that in Russia civil rights are not respected."
"Second, why persecute the opposition since it is so weak anyway?"
"Third, why do so if the public supports every government decision on principle?"
"We must realise that nobody who treats Russia and the Russians like a normal society and a normal civilised western state can understand that country."
"The Russian mentality is completely different, as those who have always been Russia's neighbours, like many Central and Eastern European nations, can testify. We know full well that Russian society always supports the government and the authorities - elections or no elections."
"That is how it always was in Russia, and that is how it is and will be."
"Of course, I entirely agree with Mr Posselt that true friends of Russia must do everything possible to change that state of affairs."
"But in my opinion there is nothing to be surprised about."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, the Russian Federation is a country with which we desperately want to conclude strategic partnerships. If not democracy, then rule of law is the key point here."
"27 February: an activist of The Other Russia coalition was released from a mental hospital in the Russian city of Tver."

"This is the rule of law?"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the EU's agreements with Russia concern not only increased cooperation in the economic, security and energy spheres but also respect for the rule of law, democracy and fundamental human rights."
"Despite this, in the run-up to the election, opposition groups and non-governmental organisations were subjected to much tighter rules on the right of assembly and peaceful demonstration."
"What is more, the main daily newspapers and radio and television stations were placed under close government control."
"The march organised by opposition parties on 3 May at first did not receive the approval of the Moscow authorities and then ended with the arrest of the participants, including the leaders of the opposition."
"Regrettably, the recent election showed that democracy and respect for the rule of law are not strong in Russia."
"I refer not only to the use of disproportional force by the police during the demonstration but also to the hostile attitude to the OSCE observation mission."
"The international community is entitled to expect from Russia's new president more than an assurance that democracy will continue to be built in the world's largest country, namely concrete measures such as a review of the situation of political activists who have been in prison for years."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, neither the Russian presidential election campaign nor the election itself complied with the rules of democracy."
"During the announcement of candidacies there was not even an attempt to keep up appearances."
"The media were under constant pressure not to publish information critical of the candidate backed by the president-in-office."
"The opposition's access to the media was blocked, and observation of the conduct of the election was impeded."
"That is difficult to accept, especially in view of Russia's membership of the Council of Europe and the Russian authorities' earlier declarations on respect for human rights."
"I must admit that such declarations are credible only to people who do not know Russia."
"The infringement of democratic principles during the election was followed by protests, brutal repression of a demonstration and the arrest of demonstrators."
"Russia has decidedly departed from democratic standards."
"We call for the rapid release of all prisoners of conscience."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to see that the issue of developments in Russia has found its way into the debates in plenary."
"There is no doubt that good mutual relations with the Russian Federation are a precondition for a strong European Union in the future."
"I very much regret that the elections in Russia did not take place without any interference from the authorities."
"On the other hand what we are lacking, like so many times before, is a simple demonstration of basic respect, on our part, for the work that has been carried out and for the culture of the nation and the country we are discussing today."
"Without a shadow of a doubt Russia is still a long way from reaching the level of social justice and quality of life that we would like to see all over the world."
"It has difficulty coping with its demographic crisis."
"On the other hand, for the first time in Russian history the highest country's representative is leaving the Kremlin voluntarily and his successor has been chosen by the people."
"There is no doubt that political technologies, tools and management methods, including voting procedures, have been tuned to perfection in Russia."
"These technologies, however, have been imported from the West."
"I want to ask those who today cry over the plight of democracy in Russia whether they are also upset about the European Parliament's somewhat cowardly refusal to ask how Mr Solana handles international law?"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the subject of today's debate is the infringement of human rights in Russia with regard to people protesting against the lack of democracy, especially during the recent presidential election."
"Not only was force used against demonstrators, as well as arrests, but the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe had to call off its observation mission because of the excessive restrictions imposed by the Russian Government."
"The Russian authorities exerted pressure on opposition groups, tolerated electoral fraud and subjugated the media."
"Non-governmental organisations were prevented from acting and restrictions were placed on the organisation of meetings."
"We obviously cannot accept the lack of respect for human rights and democracy, the lack of free speech, the discrimination against national minorities and the restrictions on independent organisations. We must however bear in mind that Russia does not have democratic traditions."
"The short period of democratisation that begin in 1864 ended in 1917 with the establishment of Soviet Russia, a typical totalitarian state, led first by Lenin and Stalin and then by their disciples, that was the very negation of democracy."
"The situation in Russia should serve as a warning to other empires and totalitarian states that are afraid of the democratic process even when the opposition is a minority and threatens only to reveal the truth, which they want to conceal at all costs."
"(NL) Just two points."
"I have no problem at all in supporting this resolution."
"But of course we all know that Russia is too important a supplier of energy and so the European heads of state and government will put this piece of paper quietly to one side."
"We know from experience that once economic interests are at stake, whether in China, Russia or Saudi Arabia, the passion for human rights of all these authors of fundamental rights charters must yield to Realpolitik."
"So let us be under no illusions."
"Secondly, ladies and gentlemen, replace 'Russia' in this resolution with 'Belgium' and the text remains every bit as relevant. Because it is not so long ago that in Belgium too, police were incited to beat up peaceful demonstrators on orders from the mayor of Brussels."
"In Belgium too, the opposition is to a large extent denied access to the media."
"In Belgium too, politically appointed judges banned an opposition party at the request of the government, at the request too of the party of which the Commissioner, here with us today, is a member."
"And the judges in question were promoted as a result."
"Let's see Europe clean up its own act first and deal with these sham democrats."
"Mr President, Russia is a great country, a global player, a member of the UN Security Council and a strategic partner of the European Union."
"Firstly, I would like to appeal for a serious, calm and objective debate in the European Parliament on the plight of Russian democracy and on human rights in that country."
"The reality is that Russia made it difficult for international actors to monitor the last parliamentary election."
"The European Court of Human Rights has ruled against Russia in 15 cases related to Chechnya to date."
"Torture and illegal detention by government forces under the leadership of the Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov remain widespread and systematic."
"In the period leading up to the elections the Russian authorities tightened their grip on freedom of assembly and used excessive force to break up peaceful demonstrations."
"The Russian laws relating to non-governmental organisations are particularly restrictive."
"It is not possible to hold a proper debate on all these issues this afternoon."
"Once again, I would like to appeal for a serious plenary debate on the plight of democracy and human rights in Russia."
"(PL) Mr President, as it turns out, the democratic changes in Russia are not being accompanied by an improvement in fundamental civil rights, especially the rights of the opposition."
"People in Russia have learned to think proudly but live in miserable servitude."
"The authorities will not pay too much attention to us, whatever we say, but the Russian people should be made aware of Europe's position."
"This is perhaps a long and slow process of contributing to the gradual realisation that, in Russia too, things can be different, more normal, and people happier, since the country has that potential."
"We must support that consciousness-raising process."
"(SK) I agree with the previous speakers that good neighbourly relations between the European Union and Russia are crucial for the stability, safety and prosperity of Europe as a whole."
"On the one hand, the European Union must endeavour to step up cooperation with Russia, notably on political, security, economic and, above all, energy issues."
"On the other hand, we must not remain silent about the breaches of democracy and political freedom in Russia."
"We have to express our dissatisfaction in cases where we are given advanced notice of a breach of democracy, as happened in the case of disqualification of presidential candidate Mr Mikhail Kasyanov."
"I trust that the newly elected Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, will respect the rule of law and democracy and create the conditions for an early start to the negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Russia."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to add one more thing to the list of abuses in this election, which made it not really an election at all since there was nobody to choose between."
"I refer to the fact that a number of candidates could not afford to enter the lists because of financial difficulties affecting their parties."
"Why financial difficulties?"
"Because, in the preceding election to the Duma, political broadcasts made under an entitlement to free air time have to be paid for if the party fails to cross a certain poll threshold."
"As a result, some parties are in debt and cannot afford any political activity. Worse still, they risk being declared illegal on the grounds of bankruptcy."
"This bizarre situation must also be borne in mind."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to begin with a brief personal comment."
"I heard the contribution from Mr Dillen, representing a Belgian party of the far right, who indulged in a quite disgraceful comparison between circumstances in Belgium and those in Russia."
"Obviously I am bound to refute his assertions."
"I recognise in them the familiar methods to which his party habitually resorts and which merely amount to a form of insult."
"Let me state very clearly that such methods reflect no credit on those who employ them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is closely following developments in the wake of the demonstrations in Moscow and St Petersburg on 3 March: we are doing so not only via our delegation in Moscow but also through direct contacts with Member States."
"In addition, we liaise regularly with Russian and international NGOs working in the field of human rights."
"The Commission shares your concern about the apparent deterioration of the human rights situation in Russia and the incidence of reported human rights violations, particularly with regard to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression."
"We were extremely disappointed when the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights was forced to conclude that it was not feasible to send an election observation mission."
"In its bilateral contacts with Russia, including at the highest level, the European Union regularly underscores the importance of respecting human rights."
"In a month's time, we shall have one of our two annual consultations with Russia on the subject of human rights."
"These consultations give us an opportunity to explore general trends in human rights in greater depth and to hear the Russian point of view on individual cases."
"In the forthcoming consultation we will convey our concerns, particularly about the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, the problems posed by the rise of racism and xenophobia, and cooperation with Russia in international organisations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"The consultations also enable us to raise the cases of individuals."
"Before and after this consultation, we will meet a group representing Russian and international NGOs which work for human rights."
"Such meetings put the European Union in touch with the concerns of human rights activists and enable us to exchange views directly."
"Looking somewhat further ahead, we should soon be in a position to embark on negotiations on a new agreement between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"It will be a comprehensive agreement, embracing the growing number of policy areas in which we cooperate."
"As the European Union statement following the Russian presidential election pointed out, we have a common interest in furthering our ties and we hope that our partnership will be consolidated and developed constructively under the presidency of Dmitri Medvedev."
"We will take care, when negotiating the new agreement, to ensure that it reflects the values to which both sides have committed themselves: a thriving civil society and independent media are the natural and necessary allies of growth and stability in Russia."
"We have learned this from our own experience in the European Union and it is a message that we shall doggedly continue - as neighbours and partners - to convey to our Russian friends both on a day-to-day basis and in discussions about the shape of our future relations."
"I know already that the European Parliament will lend us its unstinting support in these efforts."
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, I am always amazed at people who make high demands on American democracy but often have very low expectations of Russia."
"That is humiliating for Russia and the Russians."
"From the great and powerful one should expect more, not less."
"Those who condemn the methods applied in Guantanamo and the fight against terrorism, who look for the footprints of the CIA and CIA conspiracies in Europe, ought perhaps to scrutinise Russia more thoroughly."
"But such people, and the politicians who share their philosophy, do not want to hear about human and civil rights in Russia."
"On the contrary, they find all sorts of reasons and excuses for not discussing the problems of Russian democracy."
"We cannot be content with Russia's imagined achievements, such as the fact that President Putin did not breach the Russian constitution and left office of his own accord."
"That is no achievement, it is a minimum rule of conduct."
"I am reminded of a joke about Stalin's benevolence. A child comes out of Stalin's office, bleeding but smiling."
"'What are you smiling about?' someone asks. 'I'm smiling because Stalin was so good to me.'"
"'What do you mean, good?' the questioner replies."
"'He beat you didn't he?'"
"'Yes,' says the child, 'but he could have killed me.'"
"in writing. - (ET) Mr President, I would just like to say that I do not, unfortunately, support my Group's position of abstaining in the vote on the resolution on Russia."
"We will indeed need a resolution when the President-elect, Mr Medvedev, is in office; it remains to be seen what his first steps will be and the role that Vladimir Putin will give himself under the new President."
"I am also of the view that given the present situation, in which democratically-minded candidates were not allowed to participate in the elections or express their views on the situation in the street with people after the elections, it is important to express my own view."
"Otherwise, we will end up in the same situation as the Council of Europe, which has further postponed its own report on Russia until a more appropriate moment."
"Although I shall be voting, and will be doing so in favour of the resolution, the text is not perhaps exactly as I would like it to be."
"I believe that as a democratic institution it is our duty to take a principled and courageous stand in expressing our opinions on an important issue such as this concerning free elections."
"3."
"Afghan journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh - The case of the Iranian citizen Seyed Mehdi Kazemi"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on the case of the journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh and the debate on four motions for a resolution on the case of the Iranian citizen Seyed Mehdi Kazemi."
"author. - Mr President, I will link this discussion to the previous debate on Russia because I strongly believe that, if we believe in a core set of values, we cannot uphold them only in countries that are weak, and give countries that are strong an exemption."
"I am proud that this Parliament debated the resolution on Russia, and we should all be proud of that."
"We should fear the day when the European Parliament stops debating these resolutions and stops standing firmly for the values that we believe in."
"Because, today, democracy is not the right of everyone to be equal, it is the equal right of everyone to be different."
"This is a core message that we need to pass on to our partners in Russia, and we need to pass it to our partners in Afghanistan."
"President Karzai and the Afghan Government have committed themselves to building a democratic, modern state."
"In a democratic and modern state, the death sentence is unacceptable."
"There is not debate about that."
"No form of death punishment is acceptable in a democratic and modern state."
"This is the core of our European value."
"The case of the Afghan journalist Mr Kambakhsh is even more perplexing, because he has been sentenced to death because of exercising his right to free access to information."
"We should encourage very strongly the authorities in Afghanistan, the Government and the President to intervene on his behalf and use their powers to spare his life and to make sure that he is pardoned at the end of the process which he needs to go through now, meaning the appeal process."
"We should, however, also continue to help the authorities build the institutions that they need to function as a democratic and modern state, support civil society and, most important of all, continue our commitment to the security of Afghanistan."
"Finally, we should never forget that education is the core value that we need to impress on a country like Afghanistan."
"Girls have been able to go to school only in the last few years."
"There is so much work for us to do there."
"We should not shy away from that work, and we should impress very strongly, both on the Commission and the Council and all the Member States, the fact that we should invest in education in Afghanistan."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, the Afghan journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh has been sentenced to death."
"As usual, authoritarian governments are attacking those who speak out on human rights, and hence journalists and religious activists."
"I agree with previous speakers that we should not be more indulgent towards powerful countries like Russia and China."
"As Mr Mladenov quite rightly said, the standards should be the same for all."
"I would also point out that those who say we should be more indulgent towards China or Russia because they are powerful states are wrong on two accounts."
"First, because the standards must be the same. Secondly, because the fact that governments have to make certain compromises is a different matter."
"In the history of Europe, parliaments have always been the conscience of the nation."
"And parliaments cannot make such compromises as we unfortunately must sometimes accept on the part of governments."
"I therefore call on this Parliament not to apply different standards to the powerful and the weak."
"author. - (NL) Capital punishment is barbaric and freedom of expression is set in stone in Afghanistan's constitution."
"And yet the journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh has been sentenced to death for blasphemy, far from the capital Kabul, because of an article on women's rights under Islam which he did not even write himself."
"His brother writes critically about local leaders, so clearly that was not helpful to Perwiz's case."
"This death sentence came as an enormous shock, even in countries with a large Muslim population."
"Journalists in Pakistan, in Iran, in Qatar, everyone is painfully aware of the importance of safeguarding freedom of expression everywhere, worldwide. In the teeth of considerable opposition, in spite of ultraconservative clubs that hold no brief for freedoms, women's rights or open debate."
"What should Europe do?"
"1."
"Offer more help than was promised in 2007 for reform of the judiciary in Afghanistan;"
"2."
"Appeal forcefully to President Karzai to take action and support him on this;"
"3."
"The European Union must make respect for human rights and the Afghan constitution a central pillar of the European Commission's policy."
"There is absolutely no point in forcing this issue more than the ultraconservatives are willing to tolerate."
"That would be playing into their hands."
"But Perwiz Kambakhsh must be freed forthwith."
"author. - Mr President, some believe that Afghanistan is a country which in recent years has been in a state of continuous turmoil and chaotic tension."
"Poverty, illiteracy, tribal violent rivalry, drug barons, warlords, Russian occupation, Taliban terrorism, followed by formidable US-UK military intervention, and on top of all this, strict Islamic sharia law."
"If ever there was to be hell on earth, Afghanistan would be a very strong candidate indeed."
"Yet, in the face of this extreme adversity, there are weak acts of defiance, and hope for freedom of speech and democracy."
"Such is the case concerning a young journalist, Perwez Kambakhsh, who dared to circulate an article about women's rights in Islam, which he had downloaded from the internet."
"This brave act was considered blasphemy in accordance with Palaeolithic-era sharia law and he was sentenced to death by hemi-encephalic fanatically blinded so-called judges in a so-called regional court in northern Afghanistan."
"As we all know, women in fanatic Islam terms are regarded as little more than pieces of furniture and any attempt to dispute this is met with extreme action, such as the one under consideration in this resolution."
"But things have to change for the better and we in the West have a duty to see that such a change happens sooner rather than later."
"Since the West, including the EU, has a formidable military presence in Afghanistan and since the West, including the EU, pours billions of euros in financial aid into that country, I think we are perfectly correct in demanding that not only the young man in question be immediately and unconditionally released, but that similar occurrences in relation to backward Islamic sharia law do not occur again - ever!"
"Otherwise we should seriously consider pulling both our troops and our money out of Afghanistan and letting that country follow the hellish course that it will be sentenced to by its fanatic religious destiny."
"author. - Mr President, my group strongly supports the motion for a resolution concerning Mr Kambakhsh, although I am not sure I would agree with everything the previous speaker has said."
"However, I want to shift attention to another young man whose life is also in danger at the moment, Mehdi Kazemi, who is from Iran, and where the British Government, in this case, could make a difference."
"Many of us hope that the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, will now intervene on the basis of new evidence."
"This Parliament has passed many motions for resolutions which have condemned the human rights record in Iran."
"We believe that it is a dangerous country for homosexuals."
"Indeed, we have seen the bodies hanging from cranes, so we know that it is, and many of us believe that it is dangerous for this young man in particular."
"There are those who have said that it is safe for him to be returned if his behaviour is discreet."
"I would suggest that what constitutes 'discreet' behaviour in Iran is rather different from what that might mean in our own Member States."
"But the issue is that for many, in certain countries, whether they are in Iran, Jamaica or elsewhere, being gay is a crime and they are at risk."
"My group has been very critical of the Dublin Regulation which is involved in this case, because we know there are still very large variations in the way in which asylum requests are treated between Member States, and that even access to the procedure can be extremely difficult."
"We have seen a climate where numbers have been regarded as more important than life."
"This is the substance of a protection procedure: it is about saving somebody's life when it is at risk."
"It is not about the niceties of correct procedures: it is about the effect."
"We want a functioning asylum policy which is able to correct errors and take account of new information, and which gives the same high standard across Member States."
"We hope that in this case the British Government will be demonstrating that this is possible."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, let me first make two brief observations."
"To begin with, we can never, ever stay silent when the death penalty is applied, irrespective of where in the world it happens."
"Secondly, it is deeply regrettable that, every time we meet here in Strasbourg, we have a number of crimes against human rights on the table."
"Sometimes it feels as though it will never end."
"In relation to this resolution, we note that Article 34 of the Afghan Constitution very clearly enunciates the right to freedom of expression, stipulating that freedom of expression must not be restricted and that every Afghan must have the right to express his ideas in speech, image and the written word and through any other medium."
"Despite this, the 23-year-old journalist, Perwiz Kambakhsh, has been sentenced to death in an unlawful trial, and his legal rights are being denied him."
"The trial is closed to journalists and organisations working for human rights."
"The so-called crime was that he had disseminated an article on the situation of women under Islam."
"So the background is well known."
"We now emphatically demand that Perwiz Kambakhsh be released immediately."
"He has not done anything criminal whatsoever; he has acted entirely in accordance with the law and the Constitution."
"The EU and the entire world must now rally behind this demand: free Perwiz Kambakhsh."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the case of Mehdi Kazemi we are having to discuss something that really should not require a single second of debate."
"If anyone was asked whether they thought it possible for a European country to consign someone into the hands of an executioner and a dictatorship such as Iran, the answer would undoubtedly be that it was unimaginable."
"However, the unimaginable may well happen, and is about to happen, despite the reassurances that are being given."
"That means that something very serious is happening, that Europe is being gripped by a kind of madness."
"Some say that there are various legal quibbles that may bring about Mehdi Kazemi's deportation and death."
"That simply must not be possible."
"The founding principles of the European Union, of respect for human rights and life, have not yet been abolished."
"If Mr Kazemi is put to death, no one will really be able to shift the blame onto bureaucratic procedures, unless they resign themselves to the view that that is solely what Europe is about: bureaucratic procedures, nation states which are so powerful that they cannot even manage to save a life."
"I would thank the 140 MEPs who have rallied round this cause and I hope that this House will vote unanimously for the resolution that has been tabled."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, on 22 January 2008 the primary court in Afghanistan's northern province of Balkh sentenced to death Perwiz Kambakhsh, a 23-year-old journalism student writing in the local newspaper, for downloading an article on women's rights from the internet and distributing it electronically."
"The trial took place without any right of defence."
"The accused was beaten and a confession extracted by brutal treatment."
"We demand that the Afghan authorities release Perwiz Kambakhsh and that the Afghan Government restore respect for human rights, especially the right to life."
"May I be so bold as to hope that Afghanistan will rapidly introduce a moratorium on execution of the death penalty."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, a few months ago the Iranian President, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, solemnly declared to the United Nations that there was no problem of homosexuality in Iran because, quite simply, there were no homosexuals there."
"What he failed to say was that they execute any homosexuals there are there."
"The case of Mehdi Kazemi highlights once again the huge loopholes in the European Union asylum system: the fact that someone must seek asylum these days on the ground that he or she is being persecuted and threatened with death because of being a homosexual is a matter of utmost concern and shows that the promotion of LGBT rights must be moved up the international agenda."
"More serious still is the fact that the European Union, the champion of rights and freedoms, does not consider persecution on grounds of sexual orientation a sufficiently important factor for automatically granting asylum in cases such as that of Mehdi Kazemi."
"Unfortunately, this is not the first case of this type, and it will undoubtedly not be the last."
"The fact is that there are still many countries where the LGBT population continues to suffer persecution of all kinds and are even condemned to death, as in Iran."
"I therefore hope that this House and all the political groups are aware of the circumstances and will join in the just petitions made in the resolution we are submitting today, especially in relation to full implementation of the Qualification Directive, which recognises persecution on grounds of sexual orientation as a determining factor in the granting of asylum."
"Similarly, it provides for Member States to consider cases on an individual basis, taking into account the circumstances in the country of origin, including its laws and regulations and the manner in which they are applied."
"It is also necessary for the Member States to find a common solution which ensures that Mehdi Kazemi is granted refugee status and the protection he needs within the European Union and that he will not be returned to Iran where he will very probably be executed as his partner was."
"To that end all that needs to be done is to comply with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights under which expulsion and extradition of persons to countries where there is a high risk of their being subjected to persecution, torture or even the death penalty, is prohibited."
"- (EL) Mr President, I certainly support the resolution because the present situation in Afghanistan happens to be unacceptable and disappointing."
"Taliban rule has set the country back many years."
"Let us be honest, however."
"Who strengthened the Taliban?"
"Was it not the Americans, with their arms and economic resources, who strengthened the Taliban to fight against the Soviets?"
"Is it not also a fact that today opium production in that country has increased five times?"
"Why is this?"
"Let each of us draw his own conclusion."
"(NL) I am pretty appalled by the Mehdi Kazemi case and the fact that we are not all just saying without further ado that he should be given asylum: I urge the representatives of the Dutch and UK Governments, along with members of this House who plan to vote against this resolution, to stop and think: what exactly is the purpose of the rule of law?"
"Is it to enforce rules and procedures correctly and to the letter, or is it to see justice done?"
"So give serious thought to that before you vote."
"(DE) Mr President, my Group is quite definitely in favour of protecting Mr Kazemi and, naturally, against his being deported to Iran."
"Yet we are against this resolution because it does not concern, as intended, an urgent case, but asylum law in the European Union in general and the relationship between two EU Member States, the Netherlands and the UK, in regard to that difficult question."
"This is not what these urgent resolutions are about."
"Here they are being used as a means of raising domestic policy issues."
"We want Mr Kazemi to be given protection and we will support every initiative to that end, but not this resolution, whose title bears Mr Kazemi's name but whose content is about something entirely different."
"Mr President, I support both these resolutions."
"But it is my country that is proposing to send a young teenage man home to his death in Iran."
"A death already suffered by his friend."
"Not for any crime, but because of his sexuality."
"It is my country which in the past has had the proud boast that it has an absolute standard that we never send people back to face a penalty worse than they would suffer if they were facing a penalty in Britain."
"Here we have no crime and we have a penalty which we in Britain abolished many years ago."
"It is my country which, if it does not relent in this case, should hang its head in shame."
"I hope that this Parliament will not have to hang its head in shame."
"I hope they will support this resolution."
"For God's sake, this is a 19-year-old we are talking about!"
"(Loud applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, one of the values of the European Union is to coordinate action and adopt positions in defence of human rights."
"That applies to the case of an Afghan journalist sentenced to death by a court in a northern Afghanistan province for distributing an article on women's rights in Islam."
"During his trial he was refused the right to defending counsel and was subjected to various forms of physical violence."
"Yet the Afghan constitution contains a clause on the right to freedom of speech."
"As we see, law and reality do not coincide."
"Many governments guarantee respect for the Declaration of Human Rights but shut their eyes to the way it is applied in their own countries."
"That should make us even more determined to defend human rights, freedom and democracy."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to stress that, despite my Group's concerns, to some extent founded, that some of the content of the resolution may be put to wider use, there is no getting away from the fact that the information we are receiving from Iranian sources and authorities is unambiguous."
"Mehdi Kazemi's fate, if he returns to Iran, is death and it is for that reason that I shall depart from the norm and vote in a different way to my Group."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving us this opportunity to talk with you about the cases of Perwiz Kambakhsh in Afghanistan and the Iranian citizen Mehdi Kazemi."
"In relation to Mr Kambakhsh, we obviously share all your concerns and we are following the case closely on the ground through our delegation to Afghanistan in cooperation with the head of mission and the EU Special Representative."
"We have raised the case repeatedly with the Afghan authorities, most recently with the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Spanta, at the troïka meeting in Ljubljana on 21 February."
"I know that the European Parliament's Afghanistan delegation also raised the issue directly with the Afghan Parliament and that the Afghan MPs gave you an assurance that a satisfactory solution would be found."
"I believe we should continue to take the approach followed thus far, relying at least for now on discreet diplomatic activity."
"Judging by the current political climate in Afghanistan, it will be harder to secure Mr Kambakhsh's safe release if it appears that the Afghan authorities are bowing to international pressure."
"I want to assure you, however, that we shall continue to follow this case very closely and that we shall be ready to take further steps in the event of the death sentence being confirmed on appeal."
"Almost 30 years of armed conflict have wrecked Afghanistan's judicial system."
"We have therefore made reform of the country's judicial institutions a priority in our programme of aid to Afghanistan."
"We already have experts working there with the Supreme Court, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry of Justice, with a view to professionalising those institutions at both central and provincial level."
"The European Commission programme will also help the authorities to put in place a new legal-aid system - something that is sorely needed in Afghanistan, as this case has shown."
"There is currently no firmly established, independent Bar and no access to public legal aid."
"I am very hopeful that the Commission's judicial reform programme - being implemented in close cooperation with the EUPOL Afghanistan police mission deployed under the ESDP - will help to improve the human rights situation in the medium and long term."
"Obviously, the Commission also shares your deep concern about Mehdi Kazemi and other similar cases."
"The Dutch and British authorities are currently considering Mr Kazemi's case very carefully."
"With regard to the protection of refugees, we would point out that international law stipulates, notably in the Geneva Convention in relation to the status of refugees, that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion."
"Under the Iranian criminal code the act known as lavat is punishable by death."
"However, the term lavat makes no distinction between sexual relations freely entered into and forced sexual relations."
"In the latter case it would seem that, where the penalty is pronounced for lavat in conjunction with other offences, the term normally denotes rape."
"It goes without saying that the Commission is categorically opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances, and all the more so where no crime has been committed."
"The situation of homosexuals in Iran is a cause for concern."
"Violations of the right to private life and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation are entirely at odds with Iran's obligations under International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it has ratified."
"The European Union conveys these messages about human rights to Iran in a general way and also through action on a number of fronts."
"Unfortunately, Iran has not yet accepted our offer to resume bilateral dialogue about human rights."
"Nonetheless, in our discussions with Iranian representatives, we emphasise that we wish to see progress on all the issues of concern to the European Union in the fields of politics, nuclear policy, trade and human rights."
"Without general improvement in the human rights situation there, our relations with Iran cannot develop satisfactorily."
"On a personal note, I should like to extend my own warmest thanks and congratulations to Mr Bowis on his contribution: I fully share the sentiments he expressed."

"Armenia (vote)"
"- Before voting commenced:"
"on behalf of the ALDE group. - Mr President, this is just a simple amendment that has been agreed with the main political groups."
"It is to replace in the PPE-DE Group amendment the word 'by' Turkey to the word 'with' Turkey."
"I understand that this is acceptable to all the main groups."
"Since I have the floor, there is a second amendment concerning recital H, which a colleague mentioned earlier on, which is to replace the word 'territory' with the word 'status'."
"I understand that this is also acceptable to the main groups."
"I am very grateful to the Secretariat because this was a very late oral amendment."
"(The oral amendment was adopted)"
"2."
"Russia (vote)"
"- Before voting commenced:"
"author, on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) I wish to propose a stylistic amendment."
"The words ""European Court” should be replaced by ""European Court of Human Rights”, otherwise the text will be unintelligible."
"(The oral amendment was adopted)"
"3."
"Afghan journalist Perwiz Kambakhsh - The case of the Iranian citizen Seyed Mehdi Kazemi (vote)"
"- Before voting commenced:"
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to ask, under Rule 115 of the Rules of Procedure, that the vote we are about to take should not be invalidated by what might be termed procedural questions."
"The item on Mehdi Kazemi has been included among the items on breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"While it is not a resolution on asylum policy, the Bureau nevertheless decided to include this item under urgent resolutions."
"In my view, we would be giving a really negative and incomprehensible signal if a procedural reason were to undermine what I consider to be the underlying unanimity of this Chamber."
"(DE) Mr President, the information is so contradictory in this case."
"What the Commissioner said was also different from what it says in the motion for a resolution."
"He said the UK would not hand him over."
"That is why I propose to my Group that we should not vote against, as we originally intended, but should abstain and that in future we should look at cases of this kind in more detail in this House."
"They really are not a matter for urgent debate."
"The vote is closed."

"Results of the European Council (Brussels, 13-14 March 2008) (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the European Council report and Commission statement - Results of the European Council (Brussels, 13-14 March 2008)."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Mr President, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen."
"The March part-session of the European Council started with an address by the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, whose speech gave us a good foundation for debate and decision-making on the major topics."
"There were three of these: continuation of economic growth and the creation of new jobs, response to climate change, and stabilisation of financial markets."
"Three decisions of the part-session summarise its achievements. We launched an ambitious and more modern three-year cycle of the Lisbon Strategy, which offers a better balance between care for people and the environment on the one hand and the competitive, knowledge-based market economy on the other."
"Secondly, we confirmed the basic principles and schedule for adoption of the energy and climate change package."
"Thirdly, we defined further measures to stabilise the financial markets."
"The new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy primarily emphasises implementation of the reforms."
"Lately we have often witnessed some erroneous perceptions that the reason for the rise in retail prices and unstable financial markets is that the European Union has a weak economic foundation."
"The truth is precisely the opposite: it is the relatively firm foundation of the European economy that explains why the uncertainties in the global financial market and the price of crude oil and other commodities have had fewer consequences for the European Union than would have been the case had the economic foundation of the European Union been weak."
"Let us glance at some of the economic indicators."
"The European Union's public finance deficit has fallen by more than half since 2005."
"Public debt has gone down to less than 60%."
"Economic growth reached almost 3% in 2007."
"The labour market is offering 6.5 million more jobs than two years ago."
"These results are largely due to the renewed Lisbon Strategy."
"These are grounds for sober pride and greater self-confidence, but not self-satisfaction."
"At a time of ever-increasing unpredictability in the global economy, it would be very wrong to rest on one's laurels and discontinue the reforms."
"At the launch of the second cycle of the Lisbon Strategy, or the second Lisbon cycle, the European Council stressed that in the period between 2008 and 2010 we must direct all our efforts primarily towards consistent implementation of the reforms."
"We are supported by the stability of the integrated guidelines, which are still valid, and by the adopted specific recommendations, on the basis of which the Member States will be able to renew and realise their national reform programmes even faster."
"The priority areas will remain the same: knowledge and innovation, stimulation of entrepreneurial potential, modernisation of the labour markets, and climate change and energy."
"For each of these areas we have defined concrete measures based on the recognition, famously summarised by Francis Bacon four hundred years ago, that knowledge is power."
"In the European Community today, the importance of knowledge is as great as or greater than that attached to coal in the past."
"It is the catalyst for economic growth, structural adjustments and social inclusion."
"For that reason the European Council introduced the 'fifth freedom' in the field of knowledge and innovation."
"The 'fifth freedom' will eliminate barriers to the free flow of knowledge."
"It will provide mobility for talented people and open access to knowledge and innovation, which should attract even more Europeans to take part in creative processes."
"The establishment of the new European Institute of Innovation and Technology, confirmed two weeks ago by the European Parliament, also offers new opportunities for the utilisation of Europe's research and development potential."
"To strengthen the competitiveness of companies, particularly small and medium enterprises, the European Union is planning measures to facilitate operations and speed up development in the unified market."
"In view of the fact that small and medium enterprise employs the greatest number of people and is an important force in research and development, it has to be provided with suitable legislation, easier access to sources of finance and, most of all, more intensive cooperation in innovation."
"The social dimension of the Lisbon Strategy was strongly stressed at this session of the European Council."
"I think it was given the strongest support to date."
"We have reconfirmed the importance of investment in human resources."
"Through learning and training we can eliminate inequality and poverty, reduce youth unemployment, create new and better jobs, and ease the transition to a knowledge-based economy."
"That is why we have invited the Commission to prepare a review of the knowledge requirements of the European Union up to 2020."
"At the same time, the Member States have committed themselves to implementing the common principles of flexicurity, increasing social inclusion and consistently linking economic, employment and social policies."
"The adopted conclusions reflect the positions of the European Parliament and European social partners."
"Knowledge is also of crucial importance when dealing with climate change."
"Only with the help of new technologies will we achieve the ambitious targets we adopted at last year's spring session of the European Council."
"The strategic energy technology plan forms the basis of the coordinated European policy in this field, which will provide support for ecologically sound, green industry."
"As confirmed by our social partners at the tripartite summit held at the fringes of the European Council session, climate change brings opportunities for all, that is to say both companies and employees."
"The ecoindustry alone is growing by 5% a year and today employs 3 400 000 people."
"Within the energy and climate package we have reached an agreement on the basic principles and the schedule."
"This is probably the most resounding achievement of this session of the European Council."
"Our ambitions in the fields of climate change and energy were reconfirmed."
"It is important that less than two months after the package was published on 23 January, we have reached an accord on two key elements for furthering the debate on basic principles and schedule."
"The leaders of the Member States have committed themselves to reaching an agreement by the end of 2008 and thus enabling adoption of the package within the deadline, or at any event before the end of the current European Parliament mandate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, success is down to you too."
"Only if we adopt the package within the deadline will we justify the expectations of all European citizens and give a positive sign to our partners in the world, especially in the light of the negotiations on the overall post-Kyoto agreement next year in Copenhagen."
"I would like to underline this last point in particular."
"The European Council has confirmed three fundamental principles which will guide us in the sharing of tasks and targets among the Member States. Firstly, economic success and cost effectiveness; secondly, solidarity and justice; and thirdly, transparency."
"I was pleased to note that the Member States no longer regard this process as a sharing of burdens, but as a new opportunity for development."
"I am also aware of the European Council's achievement in agreeing to shape a unified European system for limiting emissions and trading in them, and thereby rewarding the current system of national limits."
"The European Council also faced the possibility that, in the event of failure of the international negotiations, it should assist the energy-intensive sectors in the European Union, because their relocation to countries with lower environmental standards would risk losing jobs in the European Union, at the same time increasing greenhouse gases in general."
"An important item in the agenda was the question of liberalisation of the internal energy market."
"It was clear, even at the time when the Commission published its first proposal for the directives in the early nineties, that it would not be easy to establish a unified market, but that it would be a protracted process."
"Seventeen years later, with the European Council calling for adoption of the political agreement by June of this year, we are getting closer to the target."
"Here, too, the key to success will be strengthened cooperation with the European Parliament."
"Melting glaciers, longer droughts and changes in precipitation patterns have a direct effect on geostrategic and security interests."
"The report by the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Commission on the security aspects of climate change realistically presents the situation and the risks facing the European Union."
"This was first document of its kind to have been debated."
"The European Council supported this report as a basis for further action."
"Energy and climate issues will be the main topics in all future summits between the European Union and third countries or regions until the end of June 2008, more especially with Japan, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Russian Federation and the United States of America."
"To enable us to speak and act in unison, we will need to bring our positions closer in next few months."
"Now something about the financial markets."
"In response to the crisis in the financial markets, the European Council has unanimously confirmed the need for four measures: firstly, increasing transparency; secondly, improving evaluation standards; thirdly, strengthening credit status; and fourthly, improving market efficiency and giving structural incentives."
"The state asset funds play a positive role in securing capital and liquidity, even in these uncertain times."
"However, the appearance of new players whose investment strategies are not totally transparent gives rise to some doubts about uneconomic practices."
"The leaders of the Member States have agreed on an initiative to design a voluntary code of practice for such funds."
"The European Council devoted a lot of time to an agreement on strengthening the Barcelona process."
"In my opinion, it was a significant achievement that we managed to place in an institutional framework a debate which had hitherto been informal and closed, or limited to closed circles and informal channels."
"According to the agreement reached at the last session of the European Council, all the Member States of the European Union and other Mediterranean countries will participate in the Barcelona process, that is to say the Mediterranean Union."
"In view of standard practice within the Barcelona process, it is entirely understandable that the European Parliament, as an exceedingly important player in the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, will be appropriately involved in the debate on future steps."
"Because the Slovenian Presidency is striving for a balanced approach to all the European Union's neighbours, we would like to point out the eastern dimension of European policies towards our neighbours, which must be strengthened in parallel with the Mediterranean dimension."
"We expect the June session of the European Council to debate these issues in detail on the basis of the proposal put forward by our Polish colleagues."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the tripartite social summit and the European Council realise that no single measure can be effective on its own without being meaningfully integrated with other measures."
"At the same time the integrated measures, be it the Lisbon Strategy or the energy and climate measures, are not enough unless we are all fully aware of their importance and contribute to their implementation."
"In the long run these topics demand much more than impersonal measures; they require fundamental shifts and a change in habits, that is to say a change in our way of life."
"Confucius said: 'If you are thinking one year ahead, sow a seed; if you are thinking ten years ahead, plant trees; if you are thinking a hundred years ahead, educate the people.'"
"All of us together should learn to live a more creative life."
"We must learn to exchange information quickly and to adopt environmentally friendly habits."
"The most effective teaching method is by good example."
"For that reason the governments of the Member States agreed at the European Council to lower the energy consumption of their own buildings and car fleets and to secure a fast internet connection for all schools by 2010."
"After the March session of the European Council we can say that the debates and conclusions were devoted to the most pressing European issues of the moment."
"However, the media did not find it very attractive because - and I regard this as a success - we managed to avoid certain debates which would have diverted our attention from the key developmental issues without reaching any solutions."
"This was one of the reasons why we managed to take a few more steps forward, but there is still more to be done."
"President of the European Commission. - Mr President, over the past few years, we have had many opportunities to discuss together the importance of partnership."
"That the European Union's ambitions are such that Europeans at every level have to be engaged."
"That we need a common vision about where we are heading."
"That the European Union institutions need to work together to deliver on our citizens' expectations."
"After the Spring European Council, we can see clearly the tasks before us, for the rest of the year and beyond."
"I would like to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency and Prime Minister Janša for the very competent way in which he chaired this European Council."
"I believe now we can better see how partnership will make us progress, namely in terms of concrete delivery."
"This must be a truly decisive year for our ambition concerning a 'Europe of results' - concrete results for our citizens."
"We must prove that Europe has the strength and the focus to withstand global pressures and to face up to global challenges."
"And we must demonstrate that the European Union is the right way to bring in the changes that are needed."
"The Spring European Council was a moment of truth."
"Would the ambitions, namely regarding the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs, but also the ambitions in terms of our policy against climate change and for energy policy, would those ambitions that had been set when the economic climate was more favourable, still hold when we got into rougher waters?"
"Before the European Council, many had doubts about it."
"I myself spoke about the need for Europe to keep its commitments so that we could be credible."
"After the European Council, I am happy to say that we had a very good, substantive debate in which the European Council not only confirmed that it remained fully committed to the targets it had set for energy and climate change, but also backed them up with agreement on precise deadlines."
"Also, the European Council confirmed the goals regarding the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs."
"Let me highlight some of the issues discussed in more detail, focusing in particular on how the Commission intends to take work forward."
"As has become the tradition at the Spring meeting, the European Council reviewed the economic situation in Europe."
"The emerging picture is a mixed one: while the economic fundamentals in Europe remain sound, the global economic outlook is deteriorating as a result of the slowdown of economic activity in the US."
"Confidence in our capacity to tackle the future therefore needs to be coupled with vigilance."
"Confidence and vigilance."
"This is also true against the backdrop of the continuing turmoil on the international financial markets."
"The message from the European Council has been clear: all authorities in the European Union stand ready to take regulatory and supervisory action if necessary."
"Now it will be up to the ECOFIN Council to implement swiftly and vigorously the road map agreed last autumn, strengthening the transparency and functioning of financial markets."
"The European Union must be vigilant - and be seen to be vigilant - as the situation evolves."
"I am also pleased that the European Council endorsed the Commission paper on sovereign wealth funds, subscribing to the need for a common European approach and the objective of agreeing at international level on a voluntary code of conduct for sovereign wealth funds and defining principles for recipient countries at international level."
"The European Council also reaffirmed its commitment to sustained reform efforts through the full implementation of the revised Lisbon strategy."
"The consensus at the European Council around this priority was indeed impressive."
"And we gave Lisbon a fresh impetus with the launch of an ambitious new cycle."
"I was pleased that the European Council followed our suggestion to give particular emphasis to investing in people and, notably, to reducing the number of young people who cannot read properly and the number of early school leavers."
"Flexicurity is also key."
"We must build on the recent, very positive agreement between social partners and see those principles translated into results across the European Union Member States."
"Another example is the goal of a 'fifth freedom': the freedom of circulation of knowledge."
"The European Council set out key measures required to make it a reality."
"For example, high-speed internet is to be made available to all schools by 2010, and ambitious targets will also be set for household access."
"We should now press ahead to ensure that the fruits of reforms are felt at every level."
"The objectives - like investing in people, unlocking business potential, making the internal market work, investing in research and innovation - must be backed up with improvements felt by people and businesses on the ground."
"This was also a point many of you emphasised in the debate we had in Parliament before the European Council."
"I count on the continued support of this House to ensure that action at European and national level delivers on the objectives we have set ourselves."
"The European Council also set out a clear road map and gave new impetus to ongoing legislative work."
"I particularly want to mention, as Prime Minister Janša just did, the two key deadlines set by the European Council, on the internal market in energy and on the climate change and renewable energy package."
"These deadlines are not just about 'tidying up the desk' before the institutional changes of next year."
"They are about bringing in essential changes as quickly as possible, so that the European Union can lead the world in this very important dossier."
"On the energy internal market package, we need to reach an agreement to show that institutions are able to deliver in the interests of citizens, consumers and businesses, and here we committed to trying to reach political agreement by June 2008."
"The Commission remains of the view that full ownership unbundling is the best way forward, but we have continued to make clear that we are ready to consider alternatives that are the functional equivalent of that."
"And we will continue close cooperation with this House and with the Council in order to help bridge the remaining gaps."
"On the climate and renewables package, political agreement by the end of this year will be the clearest possible sign to our international partners - a sign that Europe is serious about its commitments."
"This would enable adoption of the proposals within Parliament's legislative term early in 2009."
"This is vital as we enter the final straight towards an international agreement on climate change in Copenhagen next year."
"This international agreement is our top priority, and is the single best way of both cutting global emissions and ensuring that our energy-intensive industries will have the level playing field they need."
"In the mean time, we should spell out, in the revised emission trading scheme, the steps we will take in the event that there are problems for certain sectors or subsectors that face the risk of carbon leakage because they are unable to pass through costs."
"The Commission, together with all stakeholders and, in particular, with the social partners, will step up work to gather data and identify the necessary solution to apply in the future in such cases."
"I know that the European Parliament is devoting particular attention to these two dossiers."
"I hope that you will be able to join the Council in the deadlines so that we can give credibility to our negotiating position at global level."
"In a number of areas, the European Council looked forward to specific proposals from the Commission in the coming months."
"I would like to give you a flavour of three areas on which we will be working to come forward with proposals before the summer."
"First, the renewal of our social agenda."
"Our objective is to pave the way towards a European wide consensus on a social vision for the 21st century:"
"a social vision which responds to new challenges, such as globalisation and demographic change;"
"a vision which is based on the principle of providing 'life chances' to everyone through opportunities, access and solidarity;"
"a vision looking at social challenges for society as a whole, addressing issues such as youth, education, migration, ageing as well as intercultural dialogue;"
"a vision that, of course, takes more specifically into consideration the problems of poverty that we are still facing in our Europe."
"We will build on the ongoing consultation following our social stock-taking, and make concrete proposals - exactly as we did with the Internal Market Review last November."
"The Social Agenda Forum that we are organising in May is a good opportunity for us to test this approach."
"Secondly, the forthcoming proposal on the Small Business Act."
"The key to our thinking is the need to look at the whole life cycle of an SME."
"There is little value in helping start-ups if SMEs are then blocked from growth."
"The business world has made it very clear that what small businesses need is not another political declaration but some real action."
"That means removing obstacles to growth, simplifying regulation, promoting e-government, helping access to public procurement and cutting unnecessary delays: generally speaking, cutting red tape."
"I look forward to discussing with Parliament how to take these ideas forward."
"The third area where we will swiftly bring forward proposals is the Mediterranean Union."
"The Commission strongly supports the commitment to give fresh impetus to our Mediterranean policy."
"I am glad that there is now a consensus that the project will move ahead with all 27 Member States, taking the Barcelona Process one step further."
"And I am very proud of the confidence that the European Council expressed in the Commission by asking us to come forward with the necessary proposals to define the modalities for this Union for the Mediterranean."
"The European Council recognised that the Commission is best placed to devise an institutional architecture compatible with the Treaty and with the range of activities and forums which already exist."
"We will be working quickly to find the right institutional architecture to deliver a new level of ambition, one which helps us to move ahead swiftly on tangible projects with our partners across the Mediterranean Sea."
"But, let us make no mistake: institutions and instruments will not deliver on their own."
"What we need most to turn ambition into action is political will - on both sides of the Mediterranean."
"We can come with proposals for new institutional arrangements, but if there is no political will on both sides, we will not produce concrete results."
"I know that this is a concern that many honourable Members share, and we will of course keep you fully involved in further work."
"Indeed, I will have the opportunity to address the Euro-Med Parliamentary Assembly in Athens later this week."
"I believe the European Council was indeed an important step forward."
"Now the EU partnership needs to deliver, and make 2008 a landmark year for Europe."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Mr President of the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the recent European Council was largely devoted to defining the new cycle of the Lisbon Strategy and took place in a very difficult international economic and financial context."
"The indicators within the Union are, however, somewhat encouraging: more jobs, a growth rate of 2.9% in 2007 and falling budget deficits."
"This progress is above all the fruit of the business restructuring efforts of course, but it is also the result of a policy of reform and sound administration on the part of most of the Member States."
"These efforts have been encouraged by the Commission and I congratulate it on its determination and steady work in that direction."
"The wind blowing from the other side of the Atlantic does not augur well and the growth forecasts for 2008 are lower than we might have hoped."
"In such a context, it is very tempting to withdraw into oneself, to suspend the reforms and to protect one's borders while waiting for brighter days."
"There is a great temptation - and our political opponents give in to it much too often - to spend money that we do not have, to make the people of Europe believe that everything can continue as before."
"Our parliamentary group is genuinely in favour of a responsible policy, a policy of movement, reform and solidarity."
"We would ask the Commission to present to us its economic policy guidelines and its employment guidelines so that they can be adopted as soon as possible."
"The national authorities must explain more clearly to their populations the benefits of the reforms envisaged under the Lisbon Strategy."
"These reforms are often misrepresented but not sufficiently implemented."
"It is still difficult for them to make their presence felt."
"Our group will nevertheless continue to defend them and to oppose those who, in order to flatter their electorate, strive to tone them down or postpone them indefinitely."
"We want to go even further and send the European knowledge policy into overdrive."
"We propose promoting the free movement of researchers, students and scientists and adopting a unified regime on the protection of intellectual property rights."
"We call for the removal of obstacles to the mutual recognition of qualifications and the modernisation of our European universities with financial backing from the EU."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Council's second task was to clarify the conditions in which the ambitious climate change targets adopted in March 2007 will be implemented."
"These details were essential in order to enable the firms concerned eventually to plan for the future."
"Indeed, making significant efforts to 'decarbonise' the economy must not affect the competitiveness of energy-intensive industries."
"Finally, I welcome the agreement on the Union for the Mediterranean proposed by France to the Council on the basis that the Barcelona process has not produced the desired results."
"This initiative seeks to give a boost to Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"We are all aware of the extent to which the challenges of development, migration and political stability in these countries affect us directly."
"We therefore hope that this project will mark a turning point in our relations with the Mediterranean countries, which must become more concrete, more effective and, above all, more political, with a view to achieving real peace in the Middle East."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic situation in the European Union is stable but it is under threat."
"That is the conclusion drawn by this European Council."
"Growth is still stable and employment is increasing, but it is nonetheless under threat."
"The question is this: what is the source of this threat?"
"The threat comes from the slowdown of economic activity in the US, which is one outcome of the financial crisis in the major corporate banks, in other words, in the investment banks, in that country."
"President Barroso, you have said that as one of its conclusions, the Council states that we in the European Union must be ready to take regulatory and supervisory action if necessary in response to this development in the international financial markets."
"Let me ask you this: when, if not now, should this action be initiated?"
"Now is the time to look at the precise mechanisms by which the 'Wild West' capitalism pursued by investors in the international financial markets is putting Europe's growth at risk."
"In my view, as one of its conclusions this European Council should have set out in a far more detailed fashion which instruments we should use in order to exercise this scrutiny."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, we have taken note of the fact that this Council has made an effort to talk in slightly more detail about the social dimension of Europe."
"However, rather than offering a coherent concept, it does so on a 'piecemeal' basis."
"The fifth freedom, for example, Prime Minister Janša, is part of social policy."
"You are right, knowledge is power, that is absolutely right."
"However, knowledge also creates opportunities for access to economic development in the world, and knowledge creates opportunities to have a stake in an increasingly diverse labour market."
"In all occupational sectors, the best-placed worker is the one who is well-qualified, who has access to knowledge and who is in a position to update this knowledge on an ongoing basis."
"For that reason, access to knowledge also means access to social justice."
"When we talk about the social dimension of Europe, to us this means that we must adopt an integral approach."
"It does not mean merely passing a few comments here and there about social policy."
"That is why, from our perspective - from the Socialist Group's perspective - the Council has once again fallen short of our expectations in relation to the social dimension of Europe."
"That is why we listened with great interest when you said that the Commission is going to undertake coherent stock-taking of the social dimension of the internal market, the European Union's social dimension, this summer and will present the results of this process to us."
"We will use this as a yardstick to gauge your performance."
"You are aiming to make progress here, and we will be watching to see how you match up."
"However, we will be gauging your performance in another sense as well."
"It is not acceptable that the Council - and I am turning to you, Prime Minister Janša, and to you, Commission President - should be ignoring the opinions of the European Parliament."
"I have here a list of the official documents submitted to the Council."
"It includes eight documents submitted by various formations of the Council, an Opinion of the EESC on the employment of priority categories (Lisbon Strategy) and a resolution of the Committee of the Regions."
"There is not a single document from the European Parliament on this list, not even the document we produced about the Lisbon Strategy."
"This is a lamentable state of affairs, in my Group's view, because it shows that you are not taking the social dimension, the European Parliament itself and the opinion of this House sufficiently seriously."
"(Applause)"
"Some progress has been made: that was what my colleagues said when we asked them during our Group debate what they thought of climate policy."
"Yes, it is true that climate change is the key challenge that we face, and substantial progress has been made at this Council, with a balance having been struck between climate policy requirements, on the one hand, and industry requirements, on the other."
"Achieving this balance is a task for all the institutions."
"Just so that there are no misunderstandings: there are certain industry lobbyists who will interpret this to mean that there are not enough checks and not enough pressure on industry when the Council makes pronouncements of this kind."
"In fact, the opposite is the case."
"We will only achieve our climate targets if industry plays its part."
"By the same token, however, we will only achieve our targets if we allow industry to play its part."
"Both aspects are essential."
"If we want to tackle climate change, we have to do so in Europe, and that is why the international agreements rightly give European industry the chance to compete on an equal footing with industry elsewhere in the world."
"That conclusion was the right one and we greatly welcome it."
"Let me make a final comment about the Mediterranean Union, which you will now find mentioned on page 19 of the Conclusions, and that itself is another message from the Council."
"We are pleased that there is now clarity on this issue, and you are right in what you have been saying about neighbourhood policy in the Mediterranean."
"Prime Minister Janša has rightly pointed out that partnership policy here must entail partnership policy elsewhere."
"My colleague Mr Swoboda will comment in a moment on the Eastern dimension in particular on behalf of our Group, as we will be putting forward our own set of proposals on this issue."
"Let me conclude with an appraisal."
"This was a Council of normality."
"It fell short of the mark in terms of social policy: that has unfortunately become the norm in the European Union, but it is something that can be addressed."
"It was 'business as usual' as far as the Mediterranean Union was concerned."
"We saw the 'helicopter method' being deployed here: 'whip up a storm of dust and before the dust settles, the helicopter takes off again'."
"We need something more tangible here, you are quite right."
"If these tangible results are to be delivered - and this final sentence is directed at you, Mr President - they must be delivered through cooperation with the European Parliament."
"The fact is that anything that is decided within the framework of the Mediterranean Union requires funding from the European Parliament, which is why it is extremely important that the Conclusions should state that the European Parliament will be fully involved in the future structures of the Mediterranean Union."
"Thank you very much for your attention. I would also like to thank our unfailingly cheerful colleagues from the CSU who have had to show me such forbearance."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, one thing is certain: without the pressure of collective action and accountability, Member States would lack the will to act on climate change, yet the inconvenient truth for the EU is that the summit conclusions are often long on rhetoric and short on delivery."
"We can already see signs of Member States looking for ways to cut corners and costs on last year's political commitments, even though the Stern report of 2006 warned that the costs of action now will be far less than the costs of inaction later."
"Some of the language in the final conclusion suggests that the urgency and imperative of responding to climate change is already waning."
"This would spell disaster, both for our climate and for our credibility."
"Somewhat overlooked in this debate is energy efficiency, the simplest and most cost-effective way of reducing our overall emissions."
"An early draft of the Council conclusions committed Member States to a 10% reduction in energy use in government buildings and car fleets, yet now reads simply as 'substantial progress'."
"It would be a small but significant gesture showing that governments are leading by example."
"Fiscal instruments to stimulate better environmental behaviour should indeed be exploited."
"ETS has proved its worth and been taken up as a global standard for providing economic incentives for emission reductions."
"Green taxes such as reduced VAT rates can also have a similar effect, by stimulating demand for low consumption vehicles and domestic appliances."
"Turning to the economic aspects of the summit, the conclusions boast that the fundamentals of the EU economy remain sound, yet this is not how the outlook is perceived by many of our citizens facing higher bills and growing indebtedness, which should caution us against excessive optimism."
"The underlying principles of the Lisbon Strategy are worth recalling: structural reforms, fiscal discipline and targeted investments in productive areas that will deliver future growth."
"EU Member States remain - with one or two honourable exceptions - well short of their commitment to spend 3% of their GDP on R&D. Now we talk of a fifth freedom for knowledge and innovation, but we should not forget that we have not yet managed to complete the original four freedoms, especially in the area of free movement of labour and services across the whole of the EU."
"Finally, support for SMEs is rightly identified as key to economic growth and innovation."
"We must enable them to reap the full benefit of the internal market, yet the Council could achieve much for European competitiveness by bringing the long-running disputes over a European patent and private company statute to a successful conclusion."
"The Council conclusions cautiously declare that the challenge is to deliver."
"Parliament, for its part, certainly will."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commission President for their contributions today."
"It is quite interesting that, when we speak about the threats to growth and the economy, a lot of people fall back into their default position: you are either in favour of capitalism or against capitalism."
"They never see that there is a middle ground as well and an area where you can operate."
"There is an old saying in the investment platform: 'When there is blood in the streets, there is money to be made.'"
"The reality is that the real threat to employment creation and economic growth within the European Union is not so much the subprime market crisis in America but our inability or unwillingness to take risks and be innovative in finding opportunities in these crisis areas."
"It is interesting that, if you look back over the last 100 years, at every stage of industrial development and at every stage of economic development either the US or the European Union has been at the core of creating a new industry, creating a new economic upturn, because of a difficulty that was perceived in some areas and was grabbed in another area."
"One of the successes to come out of the European Council is that the Council has seen that there are risks and dangers - whether it is climate change or the fact that innovation and technology requirements are increased or the regulatory burden upon SMEs - but there are also opportunities."
"By taking action now we can take the long-term view, as the Prime Minister said by using the Confucius analogy: by planting a tree, we are looking 10 years down the line."
"That is the real way that we can achieve true growth and development within the European Union in the short term, as well as setting solid foundations for the long term, even though some of the headlines that you read will tell you negative things."
"Today's headline in one of the newspapers is about Jaguar and Land Rover being taken over by an Indian company as an example of how the economic power has shifted from the West to the East."
"The reality is that corporate and sovereign wealth funds are investing in industry and investing in business."
"We must find a way to ensure that we not only capture that wealth and those funds but we guarantee that they return dividends into our own economies by creating greater economic growth and by creating more jobs."
"When we speak about innovation and technology, it is important to remember that 73% of the workforce in the European Union who will be working in 2017 are already in place."
"But only 10% of the technology that we will be using in 2017 is in existence today."
"So the requirement to invest further in educating our people, upskilling them, giving them new training and new knowledge to deal with the new economies is vitally important."
"The last point that I would make - and Mr Schulz touched on this in a very important way - is that the success of the European Union over the last 20 years has been predicated on the twin-track approach of economic growth and social development and protection."
"You cannot have one without the other."
"We must ensure at all stages of our economic development not just that the rich get richer - that is going to happen anyway - but that there is a greater opportunity for us to show generosity and solidarity amongst our people - not just in energy markets, not just in financial markets - to guarantee that we can all benefit from the growth and the creation that have occurred."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, during the course of the debate, I had the impression that we were talking about two quite different events."
"I observed the Council on behalf of my Group, but I did not gain any impression at all from that event that it aimed to forge any new, more advanced, ambitious joint climate policy initiatives, for example."
"You may recall that shortly before the Council, Javier Solana unveiled his climate scenario from a security perspective."
"If the Greens had published something of the sort, which describes how climate change will escalate conflicts all over the world, intensifying pressure on the developed world in particular, everyone would probably have said, 'the Greens have lost the plot, putting forward such apocalyptic scenarios'."
"In fact, the Solana paper contains a lot of truth, and I am surprised that none of the valid points that it puts forward were taken up by the Council."
"Indeed, in areas where it should have been more consistent compared with what was presented last year, we see greater inconsistency."
"Our Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel, in particular, of whom I was so proud last year, was the very person who battled for a delay, a slowdown and exemptions."
"Let us be under no illusion: if we make exemption rules for European industry in emissions trading the focal point of the Council at this time, then we must assume from the outset that the Council has failed."
"I think it is an extremely negative message to send out to the rest of the world if we talk about exemptions for emissions trading for the next decade."
"How, under those circumstances, can we achieve the ambitious goal of bringing the rest of the world on board in Poznan or Copenhagen?"
"In my view, what has happened is a self-fulfilling prophecy."
"Let me say this very clearly on behalf of my Group."
"We want proper emissions trading, not exemptions."
"We would rather be protecting at our external borders a European industry that is sustainable, rather than bowing to pressure, at this crucial juncture in the climate process, from the steel and automobile industries and other lobbyists who, as we see from a recent report, are already exerting direct and, indeed, excessive influence on decisions in Brussels."
"In my view, this was not an ambitious summit; it was fainthearted."
"That was not only due to the new role of Angela Merkel, who has ceased to be the Climate Chancellor."
"It was also due to the fact that so many countries in Europe are going it alone."
"Some countries are negotiating separately about visa agreements."
"Others are discussing their own approach to missile defence with the Americans."
"There is no unity on Kosovo or on the issue of energy security: the Germans are conducting their own business with Russia's Gasprom, and the Italians and Hungarians are also doing business on their own."
"The Mediterranean Union was actually just Mr Sarkozy's idea as a way of safeguarding uranium imports into France in exchange for arms and nuclear technology exports."
"In my view, the overall framework for this summit was extremely poor and its outcome is negatively influenced by far too much 'go-it-alone' and far too little commonality."
"To me, an ambitious approach is one thing; faintheartedness another, and my overall impression of this summit is its faintheartedness."
"That is certainly not good, but what is worse is that there is so little honesty about it in the House today."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, it is understandable, up to a point, that you should come here and try to whitewash the results of the summit."
"However, I expected greater frankness and greater modesty from you."
"Instead of simply congratulating each other and praising yourselves, I would also expect you talk about the shortcomings of your policy, and about your failures."
"I would expect you to talk about the social agenda, and the social failing that was conspicuous by its absence from the summit discussion: the 70 million poor, 20 million of whom are children."
"Instead of saying 'we have created jobs', you should say that those jobs are badly paid, with flexible employment terms, and that 20 million workers in the European Union are poor."
"You should talk about your interim review of your own Lisbon targets, Mr Barroso: from the three pillars of the Lisbon Strategy (competitiveness, the environment, cohesion), you have eliminated social, regional and territorial cohesion and you have downgraded environmental issues."
"On the subject of climate change, the President-in-Office himself admitted that a number of Member States meeting in the Council had been trying, from the start, to whittle away at your package of proposals, Mr Barroso, in the name of competitiveness."
"Instead of seeing how they can make their targets more ambitious and more binding when they go to Copenhagen, the Commission and the Council are trying to exempt large sectors of industry and the economy."
"To conclude, I would like to emphasise that at a time when even the most fanatical neo-liberals in the world are discovering the meaning of public intervention, at a time of falling stock markets and the credit crunch, the Council and the Commission are even now allowing a dogmatically unilateral, uncontrolled Central Bank to concern itself only with inflation, forgetting the risk posed to the European economy by a depression or zero growth."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) At last year's spring summit the European Council expressed its desire for an ambitious climate policy."
"On 23 January this came about in concrete form through legislative proposals, which were warmly welcomed by this Parliament."
"I am convinced that in order for it to be effective, we must ensure that a constructive agreement is reached between the Council and Parliament before Potsdam, and we must therefore avoid procedures that would render an agreement at first reading impossible."
"Such an agreement requires flexibility on the part of Parliament and certainly on the part of the Council."
"The European Union's efforts are valuable, but they would be more valuable still if the entire international community applied itself to the issue of the environment and climate."
"An important step was taken in Bali."
"I am delighted that the Council will continue to make intensive efforts to come to an agreement with all the participants at Potsdam."
"The Lisbon Strategy is being energetically implemented as a result of the last spring summit."
"That is good news."
"It suggests that the Heads of State or Government see the need for a social dimension."
"Can the Council President, Mr Janša, tell us what any more about this?"
"Can we expect any additional proposals?"
"Finally, freedom of expression is a good thing."
"It testifies to an adult attitude which is very wise."
"In the Netherlands a Member of Parliament is making a controversial film about Islam."
"I hope that Europe will speak as one if it should cause unexpected disruption."
"Mr President, the Presidency conclusions from the European Council contain all the usual clichés about social dimensions and SMEs and totally fail to address the main problems of European economies, which are that Europe is over-taxed and over-regulated and therefore unable to face the challenges of global competitiveness."
"May I say that the report was also remarkable for what it omitted."
"We hear a lot about the Lisbon Process, but very little indeed about the Lisbon Treaty, which, as we all know, is in effect the failed Constitution."
"Despite all the promises that were made to European citizens, we have decided to ratify this Treaty in most Member States without referendums."
"We have made that decision because we know that the people would withhold their consent."
"In my region a recent postal ballot showed that nearly 90% of the people opposed the Treaty."
"This is a defiance of democracy."
"Later this afternoon we shall be debating the issue of Tibet but, before we criticise too seriously, perhaps we should look very carefully at our own record of democratic accountability."
"In the mean time, we should indeed be looking at the Tibet issue and condemning China for its outrageous behaviour and suppression of rights."
"I think the time has come when we should seriously consider whether free nations can attend the celebrations in Beijing for the Olympics later this year."
"Mr President, in welcoming the conclusions of the Council, I wish to focus my remarks on the section entitled 'Climate change and energy'."
"Many have identified these issues as the most important that we face in the world today, and it is good that the EU is taking the lead over climate change."
"However, we have something of a track record in adopting very ambitious targets which have so far proved difficult to achieve."
"So I welcome the note of caution that I detect in some parts of the text."
"I support calls for the transition to a low-carbon economy to be made in a way that is consistent with the EU's sustainable development, competitiveness, security of supply, and sound and sustainable public finance, especially when coupled with a recognition of the risks of carbon leakage or the offshoring of European jobs and linked with the call for flexibility in achieving national renewable targets."
"I am of the view that we have placed too much emphasis on renewable energy sources as an objective rather than as a means to an end, because I am absolutely certain that renewables are not the sole solution."
"It seems to me that we should rather think of our real objective, which I take to be at least a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050, and then look to a range of options for achieving it."
"We have already recognised - through the principle of burden-sharing - that different Member States have very different energy situations, so why not restrict ourselves to setting that goal and allowing Member States to decide for themselves how to reach it?"
"In that context, may I give credit to the UK Government - not something I do easily - for its announcements on the prospects for nuclear energy."
"Mr President, there are much better and far more reasons to support the British Government, but let me come to my subject."
"(DE) I would like to take up two points where I also believe that the summit's results have rather fallen short of our expectations, namely external energy policy and energy security."
"Mr President of the Commission, when your Commission was formed, we asked the two Commissioners with responsibility for external relations and energy to take a very pro-active role in this area."
"There has been little input from the Council too, and all I see is generalisations here."
"As I recall, when Thomas Ilves visited Parliament in Strasbourg, he pointed out that Russia has a neighbourhood policy and an external energy policy."
"Unfortunately, we do not, and that is a disadvantage in terms of our competitiveness."
"It is time to leave the generalisations behind and adopt practical measures."
"I hope that by the time the next summit takes place in June, there will be genuine proposals on the table for more concerted action."
"The second point, which has already been touched upon by Martin Schulz, relates to the issue of the Mediterranean Union and the Black Sea Union."
"I am concerned that there is no balance between our cooperation in the Mediterranean region and in the Black Sea region."
"Are countries like Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Georgia and others such as those in the South Caucasus really less important?"
"Do they have a lesser right, are they less entitled than the Mediterranean countries to more intensive cooperation?"
"I do not believe so."
"In common with Martin Schulz and the rest of my Group, I am a strong supporter of the Mediterranean Union as a 'forced' Barcelona union or Barcelona process."
"However, I would have liked to see the Commission present some finished proposals and make it clear from the outset that a union between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries must and will act, and that the heart of this union, in both administrative and political terms, is the European Union."
"We are envisaging something similar for the Black Sea region too, for issues such as energy security, migration and the environment all affect not only the Mediterranean but also, and equally, the Black Sea region."
"For that reason, Mr President-in-Office, our Group will be submitting our proposals to you, and also to you, Mr President of the Commission."
"We hope that the summit in June will offer the opportunity to redress the balance, for it is important for you, too, as your country's Prime Minister and the President-in-Office of the Council, to make it clear once and for all that both communities are important."
"I was rather surprised, Mr President of the Commission, that you only talked about the Mediterranean Union and made no reference to the Black Sea."
"We believe that both elements are important."
"We are in favour of establishing neighbourhood policy on a new qualitative footing."
"Our Group will therefore be presenting a set of proposals in due course."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Presidency on the outcome of the spring summit and the fact that the details of the new Lisbon discussions are based on truly sustainable economic growth, which I think is absolutely necessary."
"What we have to face now is the difficulties on the financial markets."
"We have to face the problems with climate change."
"These are often described as 'problems for European industry'; however, I would like to remind you that the modern, energy-efficient, knowledgeable industry is the industry that survives."
"Therefore, we have to put more money into innovation and research, and I hope you will keep that in mind when we enter the budgetary discussions and follow more of a parliamentary line, financing innovation and research."
"I also want to remind you about what we are in: a new engineering revolution, like when we went from steam to electricity."
"Where would Europe have been if we had sat back and said, 'Look, we will not do anything until they have electrified the United States'?"
"Again, the modern, energy-efficient industry is the one that will survive."
"Therefore, we also have to be tough on climate issues, because that promotes innovation, not only a better environment."
"Also, the single market for energy is, of course, extremely efficient."
"However, there is a problem with both the energy package and the climate package as it has been presented, and that is in combination with the situation of SMEs."
"Because, if you look - especially at the climate package - from an SME point of view, we have a lot of cleaning-up to do to make it more simple, to simplify the rules and procedures to accommodate both climate and the tolerance - and even the promotion - of SMEs in the European Union."
"I do hope that we will see results from this in the next summit."
"Hope is very good for breakfast but very bad for dinner, so we expect results."
"Ms Ek, it is remarkable to see your book of knowledge here in the Chamber."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, among the top 500 listed companies in the world, the European ones are distinctive for being behind the times, unlike those in the US and emerging countries."
"There is no easy finance available, especially for SMEs, given that it is only the people's banks which will lend to SMEs; they should be supported rather than obstructed."
"Furthermore, while we are speaking here in this House, the Speaker of the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile is announcing - underscoring - the massacres which are taking place as we speak here in our peaceful Europe."
"In Tibet, where a people is being slaughtered, your wise words on attendance at the Olympic Games will come across as worthy and courageous, Mr President."
"Mr Solana, on the other hand, tells us that he will go."
"I should like to know whom he will be representing: the Europe of the banks, the Europe of business and trade; not the people's Europe."
"We in Padania are with the Tibetan people who are fighting for their freedom, for their right to self-determination, a right sanctioned by the UN Charter on human rights and also by the EU."
"(PT) While the social situation in various European Union countries is deteriorating, the Council is insisting on extending the application of the neoliberal policies of the Lisbon Strategy and the stability and flexicurity pact, when it knows that this will only worsen the social and territorial inequalities."
"As a result, the profits and gains of economic and financial groups will clearly remain stable at very high levels, while precarious employment and poor pay will continue to spread."
"Poverty and social exclusion will be maintained at high levels, as is already the case, affecting in particular tens of millions of women, children and the elderly."
"However, as we have seen, the Council and the Commission are not particularly concerned about this."
"For them, a bit of rhetoric is enough, which we can only vehemently oppose."
"What was really needed was a break with these policies so that the countries with weaker economies can be supported and so that public investment can be increased in order to improve and extend those public services that are essential in the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"This would also have helped to create jobs with rights and to develop micro, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The financial crisis in the US and the high price of fossil fuels and certain agricultural goods will have particularly serious consequences in terms of poverty and social exclusion and will be felt in those countries with weaker economies."
"It is therefore absolutely imperative that these policies are changed so that we can prevent their consequences in the European Union, avoid worsening the social situation and respond to the concerns of the population."
"As a result, we need to break away from the neoliberal policies of the Lisbon Strategy, the Stability Pact, the high interest rates of the European Central Bank and the support for the agricultural production of biofuels when food products are scarce."
"We need to adopt alternative policies."
"Mr President, this is one of my last speeches in the European Parliament."
"I have decided to leave by 9 May and deliver the seat to my successor, Minister Hanne Dahl, to bring a change in sex and generation for the Danish June Movement."
"I intend to continue my political work."
"As President of the transnational party, the EUDemocrats, I cannot stop my lifelong battle for transparency, proximity and democracy."
"We have achieved a great deal."
"The Commission's internal telephone book is no longer a secret document."
"Agendas and minutes of Commission meetings are no longer secret, in French only."
"They can now be found on the net."
"The Commission's 3 000 secret working groups can be downloaded, for instance from my website, thanks to Commission President Barroso."
"From next year the names of the advisers can be found on the net as well."
"From next year we will also have a complete list of all recipients of agricultural spending."
"The list of victories for transparency is long."
"The Council has still not learnt."
"Eighty-five per cent of all European laws are still decided behind closed doors in the 300 secret working groups in the Council."
"Elected Members of this Parliament and the national parliaments cannot follow the legislative process in the Council."
"The few formal deliberations and public votes do not involve the public and the media."
"We urgently need a review of our legislative process."
"No EU law should be passed without a visible voting majority both in this Parliament and in the Council."
"Citizens should be able to hold law-makers accountable."
"They should be able to reward us or punish us at the next polling day."
"The core of democracy is the ability to hold elections, obtain a new majority and then a new law."
"This basic democratic principle unites all of us."
"Why, then, forget it when we share our sovereignty?"
"Why not permit full transparency in the legislative procedure?"
"Why are you in the Commission and the Council still hiding the major part of the legislative process, even under so-called 'codecision', where we are not properly informed about your deliberations and the divisions between Member States?"
"I shall continue our joint fight for transparency from the outside."
"Dear colleagues, I hope you will continue the battles from the inside of this Parliament."
"(SK) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the outcome of the European Council Spring Summit where the focus was on progress on the Lisbon Strategy and on launching the new cycle of the renewed Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs (2008-2010)."
"Since each Member knows which point of the Strategy is crucial for his/her Member State, I too have chosen from among the conclusions presented the one that is, in my opinion, important for Slovakia at present: investing in knowledge and innovation."
"It is a sad statement of fact that although we have been since 2004 a full member of the European Union where free movement of people is guaranteed, although we are Schengen members and, as I believe, soon we will also be members of the Economic and Monetary Union, to this date the citizens of our country still have to cope with obstacles and a lack of transparency concerning employment and they often find themselves in jobs that are below their qualifications in spite of their education level or work under far worse financial conditions than their colleagues."
"Difficulties in accessing health care are another problem that has been ignored until now: this is a significant fact that has an impact on equality among employees, students and scientists."
"That is why I support creating a 'fifth freedom' based on enhancing the cross-border mobility of researchers, as well as students, scientists and university teaching staff."
"I believe that this will enhance the quality and credibility of our universities and that Slovakia, too, will help, within the framework of globalisation, to enhance the prestige of the European Union."
"By doing away with the inequalities between the old and new Member States we will achieve what the founders of the European Union envisaged."
"Let us remember that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I feel as if some of us always expect some kind of sensation."
"In view of the starting point and the issues to be addressed, this was not a normal summit; it was far better than might have been feared for some other summits."
"It was a good summit and I welcome the results, but it is true that the citizens want action and the issue of credibility also needs to be addressed."
"On the day the summit produced its results, I was asked by a schoolgirl why I had any confidence in these results, given that they were developed and adopted by the very people who are failing to meet the Kyoto targets and implement the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy in full."
"That is why I have now taken to emphasising one particular point: the European Union's credibility with the citizens hinges on whether we actually put into practice what we adopt on paper."
"What we need now is joint and tangible action within the agreed timeframe, not national squabbling."
"Implementing these decisions will require a great deal of hard work."
"If we do the job properly, the summit will have strengthened innovation and competitiveness and bolstered growth and employment, and that is the best form of social policy."
"We see the social dimension as being an integral part of our policy."
"It is judged not only by the number of times the world 'social' appears in the document, Mr Schulz, but how much responsibility and social commitment it contains."
"Mr President, I am going to make my remarks on the climate change package."
"The PSE Group gives broad support to the conclusions on climate change."
"We very much welcome the fact that it is now recognised that this is the year to deliver."
"The commitments were made last year but now the whole world is watching - the Commission President made that point - to see whether Europe will deliver on what it signed up to last March."
"We welcome that."
"We, like you, hope that we can make major progress before the end of this parliamentary term - if we can get the right package of course."
"We will be keeping an eye on that."
"I want to pick up on three specific points."
"Firstly on carbon capture and storage."
"You are right in picking this out as extremely important."
"But you do not talk anywhere about how we are going to fund the demonstration projects which Europe needs to set up in the next few years."
"I hope you and the Commission will turn your attention to this very urgently indeed."
"Without funding we will not get this technology up and running."
"The second point is about biofuels."
"I think it is widely accepted now that we must have a sustainable biofuels strategy and, if we do not get it, then we have to look again at the targets we have set."
"The third point is about the emissions trading scheme."
"You have committed yourselves to two very important principles: that there is a single European cap and that there is a downward trajectory in emissions."
"Without those two ingredients there is no viable ETS."
"All the problems of the first period arose because we did not have those things, so they are extremely welcome now."
"You have also recognised the problem of carbon leakage."
"We know that this is a real concern to citizens, to trade unionists, to employers, and we need to look at this."
"My group attaches a lot of importance to making sure that we remain competitive and retain jobs in Europe."
"In paragraph 20, you also talk at length about flexibility."
"You mentioned it three times."
"But I hope we are all clear what we are talking about when we talk about flexibility, because we must not confuse flexibility with actually doing something."
"Out there is an army of lobbyists, all making special cases for their industry."
"There is only one special case, and that is the planet."
"We all need to remember that."
"Every company, every country and every citizen will have to make an effort."
"It is how we share that effort, not whether or not we make it, that we have to debate."
"Mr President, our citizens are worried, nervous, uncertain about climate change and energy security - yes, of course, and others have dealt with that - but also about their financial security."
"And what answer do we give them?"
"Let us wait and see."
"There is not much in these conclusions about our citizens' rights as investors, as pensioners, as consumers."
"Consumer and SME confidence could do much."
"It could be a key to better economic success."
"'Yes' to new ideas - and there are many of those in the conclusions - but what about the outstanding projects that could build confidence amongst our consumers and SMEs?"
"What about the European patent, stuck in Council?"
"The contract law project, stuck in Council?"
"Patient mobility, stuck in Council?"
"The idea for a European private company statute - will Council undertake with us to get it through by the end of this mandate?"
"That would be some achievement."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate to draw attention to just two issues linked to the so-called climate package."
"Firstly, the burden of combating climate change has been distributed very unfairly within the European Union."
"The CO2 emission limits were shared between individual Member States without taking sufficient account of how far some of the latter lagged behind in terms of development."
"This approach meant that countries such as Poland were allocated lower limits."
"It also meant that Polish power stations were obliged to purchase part of their limits at auction from the outset, which resulted in the cost of electricity rising by between 10% and 20%."
"If Polish power stations are required to purchase all of their limits at auction from 2013, electricity prices will increase by several dozen percentage points, and many sectors of the Polish economy will therefore cease to be competitive."
"Secondly, according to the European Commission's own estimates, implementation of the climate package will cost around EUR 50 billion a year, at a time when most of the countries of the world, notably the United States, are not taking any action whatsoever to combat global warming."
"It may well be that European industry will no longer be competitive on the world market."
"This calls for the introduction of provisions to protect European manufacturing, which is burdened by such high additional costs."
"(NL) Permit me once again to express my amazement that nothing was said at the most recent European summit about the problems in Turkey."
"The use of headscarves in Turkish universities has provoked a large constitutional crisis and that crisis was completely predictable."
"Now we have the situation that the AKP, the ruling Islamic party, risks being banned, and both the Prime Minister and the President of Turkey are in danger of losing their political rights."
"We have never experienced anything like this in a candidate Member State."
"Commissioner Rehn says that the whole crisis will have no effect on the accession process, which is, to put it mildly, a thoughtless statement."
"How can he say that, when he does not even know with whom he may shortly have to negotiate?"
"What is the Council's standpoint on the question?"
"It seems as though nobody is interested in the problems in Turkey any more."
"As long as we think that the problems will blow over of their own accord, however, as long as we say nothing, then I fear that a large number of unpleasant surprises await us."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office, sometimes subjects which appear to be quite unrelated are in fact inextricably linked."
"When we talk about climate change, we talk about migration, and when we talk about migration, we also talk about the Mediterranean Union."
"It becomes apparent that issues are often strongly interconnected and so the right solutions have to be found."
"However, Mrs Harms, this means that we need to try to find a proper balance in each subject area, for on the issue of climate change, for example, the action we take must not produce any undesired effects which could have social consequences."
"That is why a balance must be found in industry too, so that developments can proceed in a rational way."
"I view the Mediterranean Union as a key issue and I believe it is important to bring more pressure to bear here, in the interests of security and economic development in these regions."
"It is in our own interest to forge a more effective and more intensive policy towards the Mediterranean."
"Similarly, however, we should strengthen our neighbourhood policy - which after all is the basis for all these policies - towards our Eastern European neighbours."
"We must find ways of offering these countries in the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe - especially if, like Ukraine, they have a prospect of joining the European Union - the opportunity to complete the domestic developments that are important for these countries."
"I would add that it is also in our security interests if these countries benefit from better social conditions, more democracy and the rule of law."
"However, this policy is a responsibility that is incumbent on the European Union as a whole."
"Just as Germany must take on responsibility for Morocco in the Mediterranean region, so too must Spain take on responsibility for Ukraine."
"That is why we cannot have a situation in which some countries participate, as originally envisaged, and others do not."
"This is a policy to be pursued by the European Union as a whole."
"Mr President of the Commission, you have, thankfully, been requested to deal with the details of the June summit."
"The Commission as a whole needs to take responsibility here."
"The European Parliament must also take on full responsibility; otherwise you will have budget problems."
"We must send out a clear message that the European Union is pursuing a unified foreign and security policy, and I would ask you once again to check that the Council presidency does indeed always act as the Council presidency and is not simply a separate rotating body from one Member State."
"This is one of the weaknesses still besetting the concept, to my mind, and I think it needs to be reviewed in order to arrive at a coherent solution."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to turn to Mr Karas and ask him to convey the European Parliament's greetings to the schoolgirl whom he mentioned."
"Based on what you have told us about her critical thinking, it seems to me that she could go a long way in politics for obviously her mind has not yet been clouded by the endless procession of unvarying texts that are submitted to us, with no follow-up - none at all - in terms of practical policy implementation."
"In relation to the European Council's resolution on the core topics of the Lisbon Strategy, on economic and social policy, I have asked myself how this text can take us forward, how what it says will make any difference tomorrow compared with previous years and whether it responds appropriately to the economic situation that we have identified."
"The answer is: it does not!"
"If we look at the situation from a straightforward economic perspective, we have a recession or at least stagnation in the US."
"We have weakening growth in Asia and no identifiable actor who could take over as a driving force."
"We are about to experience hard knocks in the European Union: no longer the 3% growth that we have been aiming for, nor even 2.9% growth, but 1.3% or 1.6%, perhaps 1.8% if all goes well."
"That means that with the productivity trends that are likely, unemployment will increase again in most countries."
"If I look at this text - which has been prepared by the Commission services, Mr Barroso, in such a way that there is nothing new in the Council's resolutions - I want to know what the alternative is."
"Where is the engine for our economy?"
"Can we do this in Europe?"
"Can we offer ourselves some kind of perspective?"
"The answer is, yes, we could, because the workers in Europe can do so, because business can do so, because the SMEs are waiting for some kind of 'kick-start' mechanism from politicians."
"However, there is no political leadership to bring this about."
"There are no adjustment mechanisms."
"A decent vehicle has an engine to propel it, but what you are offering us has an empty space where the engine should be, nothing but an empty space."
"You make no connection with public investment and raising the level of private investment, and you seem to lack any connection with the workers and their demands, workers who - at least in most European countries, the core countries that have been the bedrock of economic growth - are suffering from the lack of any margin of distribution."
"There is not a word about minimum wages and not a word about social rights being integral to any market economic activity, so that we could move towards prosperity for everyone."
"I think this a missed opportunity for the Lisbon Strategy and I hope that together we can remedy this situation."
"It is surely no coincidence that as Mr Schulz has already pointed out, none of Parliament's documents were submitted to the European Council."
"(SL) I agree with the European Council's conclusion that the outcome of the fight against the dangerous reality of climate change depends on reducing the emission of greenhouse gases."
"That is why it is most important to exploit every opportunity to refrain from using natural resources and limit gas emissions pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol."
"Reducing gas emissions from household waste is one of the unexploited opportunities."
"In 2005 these amounted to 2% of all emissions."
"One of them, methane, is generated mainly in refuse dumps, which are the worst possible way of managing waste."
"The European Environment Agency has recently calculated that it would be possible to reduce emissions appreciably if waste management were more closely linked with policies for alleviating the effects of climate change."
"We have now been given the opportunity to do that, because we are currently updating the 20-year-old Waste Directive."
"This opportunity should be used to increase recycling and burn the remainder to produce electricity and heat."
"Both these activities should adhere to the strictest environmental standards."
"(NL) You have made steady progress, certainly as regards the large legislative packages concerning energy and climate."
"I support all of this."
"I am happy about this clear progress and I therefore also support you as a member of the Dutch delegation when it comes to unbundling, the separation of policy and implementation between energy networks and producers."
"As regional policy coordinator I am glad that the text of the Lisbon Agenda now sets out the position of the regions and cities very clearly."
"It is there, close to the citizens, that innovation occurs and that our funds, the Structural and Cohesion Funds but also the research funds, are being used."
"These priorities, which this Parliament set out in its resolution and on which the Committee of the Regions has also spoken, have now been well formulated."
"I have just one comment."
"For the first time the Lisbon Treaty has incorporated territorial cohesion."
"One thing that was missing - it is referred to in only one place - was the vision of the Council and the Commission in this respect."
"It was initially foreseen that the Council would also make progress on this point; it is now waiting for the White Paper due in September."
"I want to make one more common on this."
"Cohesion, particularly as a response to globalisation, means that on the one hand you say 'yes' to the concentration of research and development and important activities in certain parts of our territory -for example, the aviation industry or nanotechnology - but on the other hand you have to have a vision for the rest."
"This becomes all the more important if globalisation continues, as we expect it to."
"I hope therefore that before the next Council a vision will be set out and that the decisions taken on it, including those in the Commission, will be positive."
"(PL) In general, the Slovenian Presidency has proved capable of focusing on matters that are important to countries and to their citizens."
"I should like to congratulate it on that. The latest Council, which dealt with issues as important as the Lisbon Strategy, economic growth, employment, the state of public finances and combating climate change, provided confirmation of this ability."
"I would, however, now like to pose the question as to what this Council has actually achieved for the average citizen of the European Union."
"Were the tremendous social and economic differences across Europe taken into account when debating the important issues I just referred to?"
"Was ongoing discrimination taken into account too, along with the fact that as we enter the 21st century a very large area of Europe remains in genuine poverty?"
"Sadly, the Council failed to provide answers to these questions."
"The Presidency Conclusions make scant reference to social policy."
"In fact, the latter is treated at best as a by-product of this major debate."
"I suspect that European citizens will not be pleased with such an approach, because it means that one year before elections to the European Parliament we can only offer them three points in these conclusions."
"These points are: No 14, in which the European Council looks forward to a renewed Social Agenda, No 15, where it urges Member States to take concrete action, and No 16, which is very lengthy and wherein certain solutions are proposed and old and well-known mechanisms advocated."
"These suggestions will not get through to the citizens of the European Union."
"The language must be revised."
"Suggestions alone are not enough: what is needed is action, and that action should start now."
"(FI) Mr President, people are worried about climate change and its effects."
"The fight against climate change, however, will be much cheaper than anticipated."
"Studies show that reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as is needed to pre-empt the worst scenarios will slow down worldwide economic growth by around 1%."
"If no action is taken, the loss in economic growth could rise to as much as ten times that."
"The fight against climate change will create a huge market for clean environmental technology and a use for that technology in its different forms."
"What we urgently need now in the European Union is additional investment in product development and marketing, so that European companies can acquire a clear leading position in the global market for environmental technology."
"It will not do us any good now if we are slow to move and simply put miserly sums of money into product development, because technological development is forging ahead at a furious rate the whole time, and will also be the case in other countries unless the EU acts."
"Mr President, like others, I welcome the opportunity to support the summit conclusions, particularly on the climate change package."
"I note the ambitious timetable, and I assure you we will do everything possible on our side here in Parliament to meet that timetable, because we are very conscious of the need - which is externally imposed on us, but nonetheless very welcome - the need, before Poznań and, particularly, before Copenhagen, to have a very clear EU position on the emissions trading system, as we are now calling it."
"I have the responsibility to be the rapporteur for the European Parliament on this most important part of the package."
"I welcome that responsibility and have broad shoulders."
"I hope I will live up to the trust placed in me, and I look forward to working with rapporteurs across all the political groups to get an agreed position as soon as possible."
"There are just two concerns I would like to raise today."
"First of all, the lack of recognition of carbon sequestration, particularly afforestation (as distinct from avoided deforestation): forestry and carbon credits - the lack of accreditation in this area."
"A huge omission."
"I would like to hear, through the Chair, from the President of the Commission as to whether we can make good on that."
"I know there are some discussions going on somewhere in the Commission, but it is like finding a needle in a haystack to find out who is doing what where."
"They try to run when one talks about carbon sequestration, particularly afforestation and avoided deforestation."
"I know it is difficult, but we cannot leave it out."
"The second point I would like to raise is that the Commission - having said it would decide which energy-intensive industries would get free exemptions, at least initially, and in the absence of an international agreement, and that by mid-2010 the Commission would decide which industries would so qualify, and then take another year to come up with answers to the carbon-leakage problem - has caused a huge clamour from likely energy-intensive industries for more and earlier legal certainty."
"We do not want any delay in this decision, because it will result in lack of investment in these areas or investment being put on hold and likely to migrate to other regions."
"Please, political direction early - now, if possible - on this very difficult area."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I would like to speak on two topics: climate change, and research and development."
"Mr Barroso began by saying that the Spring Council was a moment of truth."
"I suggest we continue in this vein."
"The objectives, the road maps and the various policies set out in this regard by the European Union institutions are good and adequate, I believe, and the goals are as ambitious as they need to be."
"The problem that I foresee is more likely to relate to their implementation."
"The will to implement these goals on the part of the Member States is variable, and in many cases there is disappointingly little will to do so."
"I would like to call to your attention the European Environment Agency's recent report stating that carbon dioxide emissions in Europe have not decreased since 2000, but have increased."
"I suggest we should be honest about this."
"Sadly, the attitude and behaviour of Member States is far from united, let alone desirable."
"In practical terms, the eastern half of Europe is doing nothing."
"It is operating on the basis that its industry collapsed after 1990, and so it still has considerable reserves."
"Europe's western half, rather than cutting emissions, has increased them, despite its Kyoto promises."
"Only a few countries - Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden - have met their Kyoto commitments as regards reducing carbon dioxide emissions."
"We must take note: being flexible is not synonymous with doing nothing."
"Similarly, the European Environment Agency report shows that the Member States of the European Union will have to pay EUR 2.9 billion to use the clean development mechanism - the instrument of the Kyoto Protocol - starting this year."
"Europe is increasingly lagging behind as regards research and development too."
"The goal of according a 3% share of GDP to R&D is no longer much more than fantasy."
"The United States and Japan are forging ahead, while many Member States, my own country included, barely manage 1% of GDP."
"Wakey-wakey!"
"The ambitious plans are in place; now we need ambitious implementation of them."
"Mr President, the second topic of the summit, the climate/energy package, remains in some contradiction with the first one, the Lisbon Strategy, or the competitiveness of the EU."
"Emission limits for the less developed countries of the EU are extremely low, not taking into account the future GDP growth rate in those countries."
"However, I very strongly support the package."
"I support it, even knowing that it is a major step for our economy and will cost EUR 60 billion per year."
"How can we help our economy, then?"
"I can see only one way, maybe the simplest: cheap, efficient, new low-carbon technologies."
"We cannot achieve that in the short term without financial support at EU level."
"Common European funds for new technologies means, firstly, partnership."
"You spoke about that in your speech, Mr President."
"Secondly, you also talked about the fifth freedom and the flow of knowledge."
"Thirdly, European added value for innovation means a more innovative Europe."
"Fourthly, give a strong political signal for European industry to start with co-financing those technologies to take responsibility for them."
"We need such new technologies for energy efficiency, renewables, zero emission, coal use and nuclear energy."
"We need at least EUR 2 billion per year."
"This means EUR 10 billion from now until 2013 - in advance, as a matter of fact."
"In this way we can diminish the cost of the climate/energy package to our economy."
"Additionally, in future we can also offer our technologies to third countries, to develop emerging economies and - in reality, not only theoretically - to save our planet."
"Finally, I would like to add that I believe in our priorities - energy, fighting climate change, the Lisbon Strategy - but we need some EU money for our priorities."
"(SK) Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak in this debate."
"A working visit by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in China from 16 to 21 March in which I participated confirmed my belief that it is high time for Europe to kick-start its knowledge-based economy, and to encourage the creativity and innovative abilities of small and medium-sized enterprises for the future development of the European economy."
"I personally experienced how well the Chinese export economy is doing today thanks to its investment in research, innovation and education, enhancing the basic technological skills of the workforce and transport infrastructure."
"The Chinese Government gives massive support to Chinese firms."
"I am therefore pleased to see that this year's EU spring summit plans to create a 'fifth freedom' based on cross-border mobility of knowledge, focusing on the need to make knowledge more accessible and on the recognition of qualifications and diplomas."
"That is the only way to enhance the quality of life for our people and the only chance we have of becoming a competitive knowledge-based economy. Thank you."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of Parliament, I agree with Mr Karas on one point, namely that it is not about the number of times that the word 'social' is mentioned but the spirit of the text itself."
"Nonetheless, I must contradict him."
"It is precisely this spirit which is lacking in the text, even though the word 'social' appears time after time."
"What we want, as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, is for the social dimension to be enshrined not only in the text but also in the policies that we are helping to shape."
"We cannot continue to have a situation in which the social dimension is the fifth wheel on the wagon, as it were, which is how it appears in the Council's text; social union must be the driving force behind Europe's policies."
"Only then will we be able to convince our citizens that we are doing something useful for them."
"That is the message we want to convey."
"(HU) Mr President, the fact that we have avoided a poor compromise on the issue of climate change is very important."
"I would like to draw Mr Barroso's attention to the fact that the directive currently being drafted on renewable energy sources, expected to be ready in autumn 2008, will only bring results if it takes adequate account of the need for Europe to take joint action to develop methods and technologies, as renewable energy is still too expensive at present, and otherwise the 20% goal will be illusory."
"The other matter relates to interoperability and flexibility."
"Please take into account that the new Member States dismantled their industry from 1990 onwards, and we would like the emissions reduction for the period 1990-2020 to be included, because this makes it fair."
"We do not want to reduce our emissions by less than the old Member States; we want to make the same reduction, but the particular situation in our case was different."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of Parliament, the icecap is melting and this morning Mr Pachauri, head of the IPCC and Nobel laureate, told us of his concerns."
"He spoke about the possible sudden increase in the sea level and we are aware of the consequences that would entail."
"Of course, we must act quickly and effectively, and the 10% biofuel target will have a negative effect when we are hoping for the best."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must prevent this poor decision and adopt a positive approach instead: let us do away with the 10% target."
"Finally, Mr Barroso, I would like to put one question to you: I would like to know why you did not tell President Sarkozy that the European Union already had a European Neighbourhood Policy and it was entirely unnecessary to invent a new structure: one that, at the end of the day, would be an office of 20 people whose job would be to resolve the problems of the Mediterranean, without any consultation."
"I personally believe that it is actually an insult to our Mediterranean partners that they were not consulted about the establishment of this project for a Union - a symbolic term for those of us who are part of the European Union - for the Mediterranean."
"(PL) Mr President, I am glad that one of the specific measures to bring about development through knowledge mentioned by Mr Barroso was the provision of an Internet connection for every school."
"This is very important because it ensures equality of opportunity for all children and young people."
"The question arises, however, as to how the poorer Member States are to cope with this challenge, and what help the Union will offer."
"Another matter I would like to raise is the establishment of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology."
"I believe it would be worth accepting Wrocław's proposal."
"Wrocław would indeed be a suitable city in which to locate the seat of this Institute."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to thank all the Members of Parliament who offered their comments on the conclusions of the last session of the European Council."
"I must say that some of them were very substantial."
"I am especially grateful to Mr Daul and others who supported the continuation of the Lisbon reforms."
"I think it would be wrong to respond to the current challenges in the financial markets and the global economy in general by saying that we should abandon or temporarily interrupt the reforms."
"I am very pleased with this support for the second cycle of the Lisbon Strategy."
"As regards social policy in the European Council's conclusions, I should say that I have been personally involved in the work of the European Council for four years now and we have never before spoken so much about the social dimension of the Lisbon Policy."
"This goes for all the conclusions and not only item 14."
"The social policy was included in all items where it was necessary to do so."
"However, it is still a fact that for prosperity in Europe, we need real economic growth."
"The appropriate social policy can be built only on the basis of real economic growth, which we will achieve through the Lisbon reforms."
"All commitments to the welfare state are in vain if there is no growth and if there are no resources for the social policy, so I think that these are in the correct order."
"I would also like to add that the social policy has been included in numerous other projects."
"During the Slovenian Presidency, we have come very close to solutions on some issues."
"For example, I hope that we are just about to complete the directive on the transfer of supplementary pension insurance rights."
"A consensus on this question is just a step away."
"I hope this project will be concluded soon."
"Together with the European Parliament we are working on declaring 2010 as the year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"This would give greater importance to some of the conclusions relating to social policy that were reached at this session of the European Council."
"Regarding climate change and some of the sceptical comments made about the conclusions relating to it, I must say that this session of the European Council did not change any of the commitments undertaken last year, so it could not be said that it was less ambitious."
"We moved a step closer when we agreed on the schedule for adopting this environment and energy package and, of course, when we agreed the key principles."
"Without this agreement there cannot be any concrete steps forward."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the only successful fight against climate change is a global one."
"The numbers make it very clear: The United States emit into the atmosphere 5.817 billion tonnes of CO2, the European Union 5.177 billion tonnes, China 5.059 billion tonnes, the Russian Federation 1.543 billion tonnes and India 1.147 billion tonnes."
"These proportions are therefore clear and the key target is not just to reduce emissions from the European Union, but to reach a global agreement - without that we will achieve nothing."
"When we look at per capita CO2 emissions, we can see that the United States emit 20 million tonnes per head of population, the European Union 10 million tonnes, the Russian Federation 10 million tonnes, China 3.2 million tonnes and India 1.2 million tonnes. These figures tell us that those of us who have been emitting more CO2 per head of population for a considerable length of time need to make greater changes."
"The European Union committed itself to these greater changes last year, and this year we have planned a way of achieving them."
"I think the fears that we may have made a retrograde step when we expressed concern about energy-intensive industries moving from Europe to environments with lower standards are unfounded."
"The relocation of energy-intensive industries to areas with lower ecological standards means more than job losses in Europe."
"It also means that we have contributed nothing to reducing emissions, because these industries will emit their greenhouse gases somewhere else."
"Therefore, whichever way we look at it, we can see that we can be successful only if we achieve success over the entire planet."
"This is where the European Union made a great step forward with the commitments it undertook last year, when the world was seeing many changes."
"For example, Australia joined the Kyoto agreement."
"We can also detect positive moves in the United States."
"China, which will quite soon overtake Europe in greenhouse gas emissions, has also made some positive signs lately."
"All this is largely because Europe took the first step, and the European Union must continue to lead."
"As regards the decisions and conclusions of the European Council and their effect on European citizens, I think there are few conclusions which will have such a great and long-term effect on the individual as these."
"If we want to be successful, we must change our habits and adjust our way of life."
"This is very demanding, but circumstances require it."
"Therefore, these conclusions will have a long-term effect on every individual."
"Based on the debates in the last few years on the importance of combating climate change, I am of the opinion that the mood of the European Union is such that we can follow this road."
"Finally, I would like to comment on the remarks made about the Mediterranean Union."
"This was a statement adopted by the European Council, not a conclusion."
"I would like to remind those who were listening to the statement of priorities for the Slovenian Presidency in January that the statement, on which the Council was united, included everything we considered to be the criteria for a good project."
"All the Member States of the European Union are included; there is no duplication of the present institutions."
"That is why it is no longer the European Union, but the Barcelona Process, that is to say the Mediterranean Union."
"It is building on something that already exists, which means that we will not have to duplicate administration and it will not demand additional costs."
"Thirdly, the European Commission is involved in further preparations, which of course ensures the practical and operational involvement of the whole of the European Union."
"What some of you pointed out as a problem was also emphasised at the session of the European Council."
"The eastern dimension, that is to say the Black Sea dimension, of the European neighbourhood policy was also given appropriate attention."
"Our Polish colleagues addressed this project or, more precisely, this part with a suggestion and we gave them the task of making a more concrete proposal."
"On the basis of the preparations to be carried out in the meantime, the European Union will debate this topic in June."
"I think the European Council paid full attention to the concerns and positions expressed by the European Parliament in the matter of the Mediterranean Union."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, I think the debate, generally speaking, has shown support for the conclusions of the European Council."
"At the same time, there were some clear differences regarding the level of ambition."
"Let me say very frankly that I think we should not underestimate the ambition that was just reiterated regarding climate change and renewables and, generally speaking, our energy policy."
"Let us not forget that we are speaking of a common policy for 27 different Member States with different energy mixes, different priorities, sometimes different concerns when it comes to security of supply, also - let us be even more frank about this - very often with different levels of awareness of the problems of climate change and environmental commitment."
"So it is not an easy task to reach a common approach for a common energy policy and ambitious goals on climate change for Europe."
"We do not do ourselves a favour in undervaluing what was achieved a year ago under the German Presidency in the European Council and what has now been confirmed with more precise targets in the European Council under the Slovene Presidency."
"I also understand concerns - in fact I have expressed them myself before the European Council - about the delivery."
"Are we or are we not going to deliver on those commitments?"
"This is indeed a serious concern."
"However, I will advise distinguished Members of this House not to be pessimistic because a lot will depend on you."
"A lot will depend on the role of the European Parliament because now the proposals are there and, together with the European Council, you are the legislators."
"So, instead of being sceptical about how far we are going, let us keep to our commitments and let us show our ambition in concrete legislative work."
"I welcome the remarks by all those who have mentioned the commitment and the will to work for that goal in due course, as have Mrs Doyle and others."
"To answer some of the concrete questions, starting with Mrs Doyle's question regarding the energy-intensive industries: let us be clear that the goal is and remains an international agreement, for reasons well known to everybody."
"It is not just European warming, it is global warming."
"We need a global agreement to face a global challenge."
"At the same time as we are working for the global agreement, the directive should clearly spell out the mechanisms in favour of energy-intensive industries to be fully or partially activated if the international negotiations fall short of our expectations."
"This being said, what exactly must be activated and for whom will depend on the outcome of the international negotiations."
"That is why we cannot now, today, state precisely and in detail the concrete mechanisms for those specific sectors of our industry."
"But what we want - and what we will do already - is to give legal certainty."
"I understand the point: we can and already do give legal certainty to those concerned."
"That is why the directive that we will propose should bring full legal security to energy-intensive industries because they will already know that either the directive or an equivalent international agreement will apply to them."
"This was always the Commission's intention."
"I myself, together with my colleagues in the Commission, have been consulting with some of the leaders of European industry and they accept this point, generally speaking."
"What they want is to be sure that, in the event of there being no agreement, there will be some mechanisms to safeguard their competitive position."
"I think this is a fair position, not only with the business community, of which I have been speaking, but also with social partners."
"There is the European Trade Union Confederation, which we also spoke about."
"We are very concerned about this issue and we believe it is possible, but not by reducing the level of ambition now."
"If we reduce the level of ambition now, we will not be credible when we have discussions with our external partners, with our American partners, or with the Chinese, Indians and others."
"They are very much engaged and, incidentally, seeing some progress on their side - not enough, but seeing some progress."
"The concrete question about afforestation is very important."
"As you know, in Bali we stated our commitment to promoting afforestation."
"On the question of credits for afforestation, we are not against credits."
"On the contrary, in principle we are in favour."
"They are not yet included in the conclusions because there are some methodological difficulties."
"So we are preparing this point and of course we are ready to discuss your contribution."
"The contribution of others will also be welcome."
"We are now in the process of consulting our stakeholders."
"Another point that was highlighted by some of you, namely Mr Buzek and others, is the need to invest more in technology and innovation."
"This is true."
"That is why, for instance, we have suggested that the first Knowledge and Innovation Community of the new European Institute of Technology should be devoted to climate change, energy and environmentally friendly industries, because this is a major concern and we now need to streamline some of our programmes in the European Union within our budget and with the resources we have available, in order to put more priority and more emphasis on this area."
"Certainly it will require a huge effort."
"We never said it would be an easy task."
"It is going to be a very difficult task."
"We have a very demanding and challenging task in front of us but I believe that with real commitment - commitment that this Parliament has shown in the past - we can deliver on this, with innovation, with more technological investment and of course working with our main partners."
"Concerning the other point about the Lisbon Strategy, as has already been said by Prime Minister Janša, I think there is now a much greater awareness of the social dimension."
"I also noted what Mr Schulz said today and has indeed said in the past."
"That is why we are preparing a very important package in terms of access, opportunities and solidarity, which will be ready before the summer."
"We would like to work with you, with all political forces in this Parliament, in that manner."
"But I would like to give you a word of warning."
"Please do not ask the European institutions for what they cannot deliver."
"We have areas of responsibility that we should assume but there are others that are mainly the responsibility of the Member States."
"No one is asking for responsibilities relating to social security, employment and national health services to be at European level."
"What we can do is improve and indeed invest more in some European instruments, in order to promote social goals and also, as we have been doing through the Lisbon Strategy, promote jobs."
"When we speak of economic growth in Europe, I of course mean sustainable growth."
"This means growth that is sustainable from a social and environmental point of view."
"I think that is quite obvious."
"We have to realise that the instruments available at European level are limited."
"You will remember that when this Commission proposed a 'globalisation adjustment fund', a new instrument, there were some arguments against that instrument concerning subsidiarity and questions why something that should be done was being done only at European Union level."
"We got the agreement in the end and I am happy to see the instrument, even if it is modest, now exists and is a concrete sign of our commitment to look after those who are not the winners in globalisation."
"Among those who are really pro-Europe and support the European project, I think we should be careful not to put the European Union in a position where it does not fulfil some commitments that the European Union as such cannot deliver if it does not have the support of the Member States and our governments."
"A lot has to be done at national level."
"This is why, while we can highlight that concern and you can certainly put forward proposals and legislative proposals for our package in May, it is important to do so with a sense of what is the responsibility of the European Union institutions and what is the responsibility of our national governments."
"Finally, regarding the Mediterranean Union, I think we could make this project a good project for Europe that translates a renewed commitment to the Mediterranean."
"It is true that we should do more - at the same time, hopefully, keeping the European Union together and not divided."
"Of course when I speak of the European Union, I am not only speaking about the Member States but also about the European institutions."
"Certainly we expect the European Parliament to retain a very important role in this Mediterranean Union."
"That is a way of making the Barcelona Process and our neighbourhood policy more ambitious."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) I would like to begin by thanking the President-in-Office of the European Union, the excellent Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, his government and his administration for the very admirable and difficult work they have done."
"As regards the results of the European Council of 13 and 14 March 2008, I welcome the political consensus on the Euro-Mediterranean issue."
"I am also pleased with the move towards establishing knowledge as the fifth Community freedom."
"Given the current disruption in the financial markets, I am sorry that the European Council, a high-level political body in the Union, did not have the strength, wisdom or clarity of thought to propose a policy that might help to regulate the financial markets, at the very least within Europe, such as the establishment of European regulatory bodies in the key sectors of the internal market (energy, postal services, telecommunications, auditing, banking, insurance, etc.)."
"Finally, given the current chaos in the monetary markets, I do not understand why these problems have not been examined at all or to only a minor degree: it is becoming urgent to interpret what is meant by the price stability envisaged in the mandate of the European Central Bank enshrined in Article 105 of the Treaty and to call on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to engage in a global monetary dialogue."
"in writing. - (RO) The conclusions of the European Council of 13/14 March 2008 and the debates in the European Parliament of 26 March 2008 point out the importance of the EU neighbourhood policy and approve the Mediterranean Union principle, a more substantial mechanism of cooperation between the EU Member States and the non-member states in the southern vicinity of the Union."
"I believe that EU priorities should also be focused on the eastern issue of the neighbourhood policy: to this end, I point out the necessity of closer cooperation with the Republic of Moldova."
"Thus, I support the conclusion of a new cooperation agreement between the EU and the Republic of Moldova, with clear and strict references to the much required progress in Kishinev in the field of democracy, the federal state and the enforcement of human rights."
"EU expectations should focus on assuring the true freedom of the press in Kishinev."
"Flagrant cases of violation of freedom of the press such as the case of the journalists at the radio station ""Voice of Basarabia” or certain televisions or newspapers in Romanian operated or published in Kishinev have been frequently cited lately."
"Such reports should not be a matter of indifference to the European Council and Commission."
"I truly hope that a more consistent EU policy in the eastern neighbourhood will become a priority for the political action of the European Council and Commission."
"in writing. - A co-ordinated long-term policy is needed which sets out ways to tackle climate change by sector."
"The package submitted by President Barroso to the Parliament is a step forward and it is encouraging that the Council recognizes that the EU must agree on a range of policies before the end of 2008."
"I welcome the target to increase the use of renewable, sustainable energy by 20% and there should also be a target in place to improve energy efficiency."
"The package should include a target to decrease carbon emissions by 30% by the year 2020 and targets for decreasing carbon emissions every year are needed at Member State level as well."
"These targets need to be outlined in legislation."
"It would seem that such legislation is the only way to guarantee that we are tackling carbon emissions properly in every aspect of policy making and political decision-making."
"We must be careful that a target for motor fuel partially composed of biofuel does not cause damage."
"Unless climate change is tackled worldwide disasters will result."
"It will damage our surroundings, our economies and our society."
"Following the decisions of the European Council, I have only one small comment to make on the guidelines for employment policies in the various Member States."
"The European Council has confirmed (which is not surprising) the current EU guidelines in order to complete another stage in the liberalisation of labour markets and in the intensification of worker exploitation, with the aim of increasing capital gains."
"This must be how to interpret these guidelines, which, under the deceitful guise of flexicurity, have the objective of increasing flexibility in labour markets, work organisation and labour relations, including what they advocate on amending labour law by revising, where necessary, various contract terms and provisions on working time."
"The result will be more time at work, a faster rate of work, a loss of wages, fewer rights and less job security for workers, purely in the interests of employers."
"Using this Trojan horse of the alleged modernisation of labour markets, job protection mechanisms, public administration and social welfare systems, the EU is confirming its goals of dismantling and destroying the economic and social victories of workers."
"Given these goals, how can national referenda on the proposed Treaty be avoided?"
"in writing. - (RO) The beginning of the new 3-year cycle of the Lisbon strategy was a central part of this European summit."
"Among the Council proposals I would like to point out the importance of the principle of the free movement of knowledge within the European Union."
"The introduction of this freedom should be supplemented by legislative proposals from the Commission to be presented in the course of this year."
"I remind you that, in parallel with the Lisbon strategy, the Bologna process on the establishment of a common education space by 2010 should also be implemented as soon as possible."
"Thus, mutual recognition of university diplomas and other formal and informal qualifications, the extension and adequate funding of European mobility programmes such as Erasmus, Comenius or Leonardo, as well as the launching of a new generation of educational curricula and institutions jointly elaborated by the Member States could contribute to the implementation of the free movement of knowledge."
"In order to enhance the consistency of this new principle of Community law, we must also elaborate a programme with well-established deadlines to eliminate all current barriers to the free movement of knowledge."
"I believe that a commitment to adopt a Charter of Intellectual Property Rights by the end of 2008 is a good step in this direction."
"in writing. - (HU) The lesson to be learned from the March summit is that the world's financial markets, and global flows of goods and capital, are poised between Scylla and Charybdis, and only responsible strategic thinking based on Community policy can help to avert the increasing uncertainty and shock to the European Union's economy."
"These fault lines, as we know, are not only breaking up the global economy."
"In the Presidency conclusions of the Council meeting, considerable emphasis is given to a multifaceted interpretation of cohesion, which will be able to rely to an extent on Community resources, but there is also a warning inherent in the call upon national policies to speed up the reduction of their deficits and debt, and to spend any unexpected surplus income on this."
"In other words, the hole in the budget is not just a matter for Member States; it is also an impediment to implementation of European Union cohesion policy."
"After all the fine pronouncements, it is time for decisions and for binding regulations, even if these sometimes entail announcing painful consequences."
"As far as I am concerned, the first priority is unquestionably to increase young people's knowledge capital."
"Increasing the kind of knowledge that also reaches poor people, Roma people and immigrants."
"Increasing the kind of knowledge that is European and broad-based, the kind of cohesion policy that does not rob poorer Member States of their intellectual capital by way of a 'brain drain', but that also finds a way, with solidarity, to reproduce the increasingly global and continuous flow of knowledge capital."
"In this way, investment in people will represent a special comparative advantage in the global market, and movement of knowledge capital will not represent the threat of some new kind of delocalisation, but rather a source of wealth on a European scale."
"in writing. - (RO) I would like to point out five themes among the conclusions of the Council, that thousands of Romanians, and perhaps many other Europeans, thought of this morning before leaving for work."
"1."
"A reduction in the administrative burden under EU legislation."
"The lesson should be learnt by all Member States, and for instance by Romania, where a reduction of bureaucracy costs by 1% would generate a saving of one billion euros."
"2."
"The adoption of the Small Business Act - the initiative on SMEs - and the principle of enactment taking account of small businesses."
"This is a good idea for Romania, where SMEs account for 70% of GDP and jobs for 60% of the employed population."
"3."
"The rate of unemployment amongst young people: Romania ranks second at Union level, with an unemployment rate of 21% among young people."
"4."
"The provision of quality, affordable structures for child care."
"In large Romanian towns kindergartens cover less than 70% of parents' demand."
"5."
"The improvement of energy efficiency."
"A simple way to achieve this goal is thermal rehabilitation of buildings."
"In Romania there are more than 80,000 blocks of flats that are an enemy to energy and cost savings."
"Over the last six years, insulation work on two such blocks of flats started in the capital of Romania."
"in writing. - (RO) The Council expressed its intention to conclude the climate change and energy package by the end of the mandate in 2009, and for this reason the European Union must endeavour to observe this commitment and to remain a leader in the fight against global warming."
"The goal is to conclude, in Copenhagen, in 2009, an ambitious agreement on climate change, for the period after 2012, so that EU preserves its credibility at international level."
"Another important elements debated in the Council was the risk of relocation of CO2 emissions released by energy intensive industries which are exposed to international competition and will migrate to less regulated markets with a cheaper labour force."
"The European Union is committed to protect the competitiveness of European industries and, implicitly, the jobs generated thereby, and this matter will be included in an international agreement on solving this problem."
"The ambitious proposed package presented by the Commission represents a true challenge for the European Union and we, the European Parliament, will endeavour to assure that this package is finalised in 2009."
"in writing. - (DE) Last year we committed to tough and ambitious environmental targets and the time has now come to face up to the challenge of achieving them."
"The imperative for the EU, however, is to attain its environmental goals without committing economic suicide."
"We must not play ecology off against the economy."
"I therefore welcome the compromise that was identified at the recent summit."
"Combating climate change comes at a cost of course."
"However, the cost of inaction will greatly exceed the cost of the mitigation measures required."
"Nonetheless, it is essential to ensure that the burden of reducing CO2 emissions is divided equitably among the Member States and industrial sectors, and also, in my view, to ensure that those Member States that have already done more than the others to combat climate change are not put at a disadvantage."
"The energy-intensive sectors must make their contribution to cutting CO2 emissions as well."
"We must demand that they, too, convert their production processes to the latest environmentally-friendly technologies."
"In the interests of competitiveness in the European economy, however, we must do our utmost to prevent any relocation of CO2-intensive sectors to countries outside the EU."
"If the climate movement in Europe could motivate developing economies such as China or India to play their part as well, that would be a welcome step."
"in writing. - (FI) The suggestion by the representative of the country holding the presidency that there was a link between the EU's favourable economic growth and the Lisbon Strategy is not credible."
"The Lisbon Strategy has none of the informed criteria that would explain the reduction in budget deficits and in public indebtedness or the creation of 6.5 million new jobs."
"The credit for this goes to the Member States."
"It is in their economies that the lack of any social dimension in the Lisbon Strategy is made conspicuous."
"The buzzword for today is 'flexicurity'."
"It means that making working conditions more flexible should be rewarded with job security."
"A better description of the spirit of the times, however, would be the world 'flexinsecurity'."
"EU nationals are being threatened with redundancy should they not agree to enforced flexibility."
"in writing. - (RO) The European Union must become a leader in the fight against climate change."
"The adoption of a less polluting policy would improve the quality of life of the 490 million of European citizens."
"The Member States should develop policies and actions for energy security and the fight against climate change leading to sustained economic development and job creation."
"The European Council established several guidelines: investments in research and development, promotion of ecological transport, review of the Directive on energy taxation, increase in energy efficiency and, above all, the provision of information to and involvement of European citizens in the fight against climate change."
"The European Council held in March 2008 pointed out the importance of enhancing EU energy security."
"The European Council held in 2007 declared the Nabucco project to be a project of European interest for the diversification of energy sources and energy security within the Union."
"We are looking forward to the presentation, in November 2008, of the revised strategic energy policy that will focus on the security of the energy supply, interconnection and the Union's external policy in the field of energy."
"I congratulate the European Council on the introduction of the fifth freedom: ""the free movement of knowledge”."
"This is a great challenge to which the Union must respond by investing in human resources, SMEs and the social Europe."
"Welcome"
"May I extend a very warm welcome to a delegation in the visitors' gallery from the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile, led by its Speaker, Karma Chophel."
"Welcome to the European Parliament!"
"(Applause)"
"Situation in Tibet (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Tibet."
"For many years now the European Parliament has resolutely championed the cause of human rights in Tibet."
"In numerous resolutions we have called for a constructive dialogue between the Chinese leadership and the Dalai Lama and respect for the human rights of the Tibetan people."
"In doing so, we are guided by our principles and values, of which fundamental rights are an integral part: the dignity of each and every individual, and the realisation of their own and their ethnic community's cultural and religious identity are the values we espouse."
"The events in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and in other Chinese cities since 10 March this year are deeply disturbing."
"We condemn every form of violence and the disproportionate use of the military and police."
"(Applause)"
"We condemn the deaths of people who were acting peacefully."
"We declare our solidarity with the Dalai Lama, who is a symbol of peace, understanding and compromise."
"We cannot allow a situation in which the Dalai Lama's name is linked with terrorism."
"(Applause)"
"We cannot allow the demonisation of the Dalai Lama."
"On a personal note, may I say that whenever I have met the Dalai Lama, the impression that I have always gained is of a person with a profound commitment to peace, reconciliation and human rights."
"I have every confidence and trust in the Dalai Lama and wish to convey my great respect and appreciation to him."
"I therefore call on those in power in Beijing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and, while upholding the territorial integrity of China, to reach an understanding that respects and guarantees the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people."
"The Dalai Lama has accepted our invitation to address the European Parliament as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and this has been scheduled for the month of December."
"However, I hope you will agree that in light of recent events in Tibet, the Dalai Lama is welcome here in the European Parliament at any time."
"(Applause)"
"Dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and China are in our mutual interests."
"China is a great nation and we wish to cooperate with China on the basis of partnership."
"In a few months' time, China will host the Olympic Games."
"We want these Games to be a success."
"However, there are certain preconditions for this: respect for the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people, and free and fair reporting before and during the games."
"The fact that journalists and correspondents have been expelled from Tibet must therefore be condemned."
"As someone who was very pleased to be attending the opening ceremony of the Games in Beijing together with the Presidents of the other institutions, let me make one thing very clear, here and now, in the plenary sitting of the European Parliament: every politician with a sense of responsibility must ask themselves whether they can take part in the opening ceremony if the Chinese leadership does not seek dialogue and compromise."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we wish to make our contribution so that the world's athletes can meet in fair and free competition in Beijing."
"However, our values and our self-respect will not allow us to surrender our principles."
"We in the European Parliament have a special responsibility in this regard."
"(The House rose and accorded the speaker a standing ovation)"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is following with anguish the development of the situation in Tibet and the neighbouring provinces in China which have a sizeable Tibetan population, such as Tsinghai, Szechwan and Kansu."
"European Union representatives have been in frequent contact with Chinese representatives ever since the start of the disturbances in Tibet."
"In response to the request by the European Union, their Chinese counterparts gave the EU troika the first report on the events in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, on 15 March."
"The situation in Tibet was also discussed at the meeting of European Union representatives with the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister on 17 March."
"Both sides agreed at that meeting that dialogue about the events in Tibet must be continuous and open."
"Following the incident at the Chinese Embassy in Brussels, European Union representatives were invited for talks with the same official on 19 March."
"Because of numerous protests in Europe relating to the events in Tibet, this official demanded an apology and compensation in the event of damage to Chinese Embassies."
"At the beginning of last week, on 17 March, the Presidency expressed its deep concern in the light of numerous reports about the disturbances in Tibet."
"It expressed its deepest sympathies to victims' families and stressed that it would like to receive from the Chinese government urgent clarification of the situation in Tibet."
"The Presidency advised all parties to act with restraint."
"It called on the Chinese government to renounce the use of force against the protesters and to respond to the protests in accordance with internationally adopted democratic principles."
"At the same time the Presidency called on the protesters to renounce violence."
"It emphasised the importance it gave to the right to free expression and peaceful protest."
"As we know, the European Union supports the territorial integrity of China, but it strives for peaceful reconciliation between the Chinese authorities and the Tibetan religious leader, the Dalai Lama, and his representatives."
"That is why our statement calls on the Chinese government to respond to the concerns of the Tibetans in respect of the human rights."
"The European Union is encouraging both parties to enter into constructive dialogue."
"This could be the foundation for a permanent solution which would be acceptable to all and would respect Tibetan culture, religion and identity."
"In addition to the previously mentioned statement by the Presidency, the European Union called on the Chinese government to allow independent international media access to Tibet."
"This is an issue that you yourself mentioned, Mr President."
"The Chinese have so far rejected the suggestion, saying that media access would be allowed as soon as the situation in Tibet became safe."
"The international community is still unable to obtain reliable information on the numbers of casualties among the Tibetan protesters."
"During the latest discussions, the Chinese authorities hinted to the Slovenian Presidency that, in the next few days, it would allow a group of European journalists access to Tibet and freedom to report."
"The Presidency hopes that this will come to fruition."
"I would also like to stress that we have asked the Chinese authorities for clarification on the future fate of those protesters who had not reported to the authorities by the end of last week."
"They answered that all those who violated Chinese laws would be prosecuted according to current legislation."
"The European Union expressed concern that further detention of protesters who had peacefully expressed their will might cause renewed tension between the Tibetans and the Han, that is to say the Chinese community in Tibet."
"At the same time the EU would like to stress that national security legislation should not be applied in order to restrict human rights."
"Mr President, you also mentioned the question of the Olympic Games in China."
"I must emphasise that, at last week's informal ministerial meeting in Slovenia, the European Union Ministers for Sport, together with the Presidents of the national Olympic committees of all the Member States, the countries of the Western Balkans and Norway, unanimously adopted a declaration in which they stressed the importance of the Olympic movement and its values in promoting and supporting human rights."
"At the same time they spoke out against a boycott of the Olympic Games."
"They did not discuss participation in the opening ceremony."
"The Presidency is of the opinion that a boycott of the Games or other sporting events in the year of intercultural dialogue would not be an appropriate response to unresolved political questions."
"It could also mean a lost opportunity to promote respect for human rights."
"May I also say that the session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva was marked by concerns about the situation in Tibet."
"In the debate on the Vienna Declaration and the Action Plan, the European Union invited both sides to avoid the use of force and to respect internationally approved standards of human rights."
"Dialogue between the European Union and China has been continuing this week."
"In yesterday's telephone conversation, the President of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council, the Slovenian Foreign Minister, Dr Rupel, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Peoples' Republic of China, Mr Yang Jeichi, discussed among other topics the situation of the Tibetan community."
"Dr Rupel reiterated to Mr Yang the European Union's hope that the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama or his representatives would begin dialogue as soon as possible."
"At the same time he called on the Chinese authorities urgently to release protesters who had peacefully expressed their opinions."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very happy that this debate is taking place today because the Foreign Ministers are still to discuss exactly how to deal with the situation."
"The debate today is therefore a very timely one."
"It is good that I can also give you my preliminary thoughts on it."
"Like you, Mr President, we, the Commission, are also deeply concerned about the unrest and the violence in Tibet."
"We are concerned about the reports of many people killed and wounded, of looting and burning."
"While there are divergent figures - as our Council President just said - on the number of victims, one thing is clear: the number of those killed or wounded seems to go into the hundreds."
"We therefore convey our sympathy and condolences to all the victims and their families."
"Violence is never acceptable and will not contribute to finding a lasting solution."
"We therefore call on the Chinese authorities to exert the maximum restraint when dealing with protesters and in particular not to use force against those involved in peaceful demonstrations."
"The Commission urges the Chinese Government to allow independent media access."
"I am encouraged by the fact that the Chinese Government has informed the Commission that it is now organising a foreign press trip, including European correspondents, to Tibet for coverage from 26 to 28 March."
"This is an important element, as independent verification of the facts is crucial for the understanding of the situation."
"I hope that foreign media will be able to do their work without restrictions."
"We will continue to monitor developments closely."
"The European Union firmly supports peaceful reconciliation between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama and his representatives."
"A lasting solution can, as we all conclude, only be achieved by peaceful means and by a sincere and honest dialogue."
"We strongly encourage the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama to enter into such a constructive and substantive dialogue - there has been a lot of dialogue but no substantive dialogue - with a view to reaching a sustainable solution, acceptable to all, that will fully respect the Tibetan culture, religion and identity."
"The European Union has always supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China, including Tibet."
"But this does not imply that the human rights situation in Tibet and in China in general is purely an internal affair."
"They are legitimate concerns of the international community, a fact which is underlined by the existence of instruments of international law for the protection of human rights for over half a century."
"We attach high importance to the right of expression, including the right of peaceful demonstration without restraint."
"We therefore also call on the demonstrators to desist from violence."
"We are going to take up these issues with the Chinese side, also in our regular human rights dialogues."
"Within the context of the forthcoming human rights dialogue, it has also been proposed that the next field visit in China should go to Tibet."
"The recent developments have made this suggestion even more relevant."
"I am aware of the protests last week in front of Chinese diplomatic missions, some of which have turned violent and where some material damage was caused and some missions blocked by protesters."
"This is of course regrettable."
"I understand that the situation has now calmed down and I am confident that the relevant EU Member States' authorities will protect the Chinese missions in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations."
"Let me finally say a word on the question of the Olympic Games."
"We believe that the Olympic Games are not a political event."
"But they should be held in an environment commensurate with the message of peace inherent in the Olympic spirit and in an atmosphere of freedom of speech and freedom of media."
"Of course, we will all see and closely follow how things will unfold in the coming days and weeks."
"For now, I think the most pressing question is how we as the European Union can work together to deliver a strong and coherent message to the Chinese authorities and to the Tibetan demonstrators: a message which will help bring the violence to an end and the two sides together in a really substantive dialogue."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, the Olympic Games are a symbol of peace and reconciliation."
"We, the citizens of Europe, must stand firmly by our common values: respect for human dignity, liberty and human rights."
"We, my friends, cannot simply stand by in silence while a government murders its own citizens."
"We cannot tolerate wholesale trampling on human and minority rights."
"This is why the group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) demands that the Chinese authorities call a halt to the violence and the intimidation of their citizens and the Dalai Lama, and we call upon them to initiate peaceful dialogue on reconciliation and autonomy in Tibet."
"We consider His Holiness the Dalai Lama to be our friend and a figure of unquestionable moral authority, and we welcome the responsible stance he has taken regarding the current situation."
"I welcome the responsible statement made by the President of this Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering, that we should deploy every possible means at our disposal to urge the reluctant Chinese authorities to halt the violence and respect human and minority rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as I mentioned earlier, the Olympic Games are a symbol of peace and reconciliation, and this is what they must continue to represent."
"The Olympic Games are a symbol of human achievement and of the values that bind human beings together, and this is what they must continue to represent."
"Do the Chinese authorities seriously think, indeed do we seriously think that it is possible for the world's sportspeople to come together and compete happily and harmoniously while the government that is hosting the Games is simultaneously murdering its own citizens?"
"Do the Chinese authorities seriously think (...)"
"(Loud applause)"
"Do we seriously think, ladies and gentlemen, that we freedom-loving people will be able to shake hands with leaders who are holding a machine gun in their other hand?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the time is not yet ripe to call for a boycott; the Olympic Games are still five months away."
"We must, however, state our opinion with absolute clarity, namely that we call upon the Chinese authorities immediately to halt their power-crazed behaviour on the issue of Tibet, which is jeopardising this great world sporting event."
"They must end the bloodshed, they must end the violation of civil liberties - of press freedom, freedom of association and religious freedom - and they must stop intimidating this man of peace, the Dalai Lama."
"Stop the massacre, stop the violation of civil liberties, stop the intimidation of the Dalai Lama!"
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope it will be useful for the European Parliament to make its voice heard on the tragic events in Tibet, prior to the meeting of the European Foreign Ministers."
"It is important, first of all, to act on the request of the Dalai Lama for an independent commission to go to Tibet so as to let the world know the truth and the true scope of this tragedy."
"Then there is the situation of numerous prisoners, and reports of disappearances, reports of recourse to torture: we must shed light on all of this."
"Secondly, the appalling crisis of the last few days should make the international community strive to find a negotiated solution which - with due respect for the UN resolutions that do exist even though no one refers to them any more - enables the Tibetan people to see their culture, their language and their religion being respected."
"For this purpose among others, the political role of the Dalai Lama is irreplaceable: indeed, he is the guarantor of a balance which does not push the Tibetan question all the way to independence, but consequently he is nonetheless intransigent on the question of his people's rights."
"While there is still time, it is vital to defuse the tension between Chinese nationalism and the Tibetan independence movement."
"The words which the Dalai Lama addressed to his people, even threatening to resign, testify to the risks."
"That is why, if the Chinese authorities really want peace, they must accept the political role of the Dalai Lama and enter into direct negotiations with him."
"The brutal repression of the past few days could indicate that the Chinese have made their decision, and if that decision is taken to extremes it will end in tragedy."
"Finally, on the Olympic Games, I wish to say the following to Europe's governments: please do not make us watch this spectacle about who is and who is not going."
"The Dalai Lama has maintained with some justification that to isolate China would help neither the Tibetan cause nor the more general cause of human rights."
"I think it is wrong to say that the Dalai Lama cannot do otherwise, because that implies the man is insincere, whereas he has demonstrated that he is not; such statements can only weaken him."
"The message we wish to send to the Council is this: shoulder your responsibilities, present a united front; what we need is not a gesture but a coherent long-term policy."
"Then we shall start to look at China without the schizophrenia which has led multinational companies, including European ones, to oppose progress in the field of trade union rights, and we shall send a clear message to the Chinese authorities, namely that a major economic and commercial power has obligations on both the domestic and international fronts; this applies before, after and even during the Olympics."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 70 years ago - I have not been able to count the days - Europe, the Europe of nation states, declared that it could not and would not die for Danzig, that cowardly Europe, that anti-liberal - although formally antifascist - Europe, in its entirety, was jointly responsible for one of the two most horrific wars ever, those scars on the face of humanity."
"Today, in different ways, we do not wish to die for Darfur, we did not wish to die for Yugoslavia and we do not wish to die for Tibet."
"This Europe really is the Europe of nation states."
"Take a fresh look at Spinelli and read the Ventotene Manifesto, listen to the words of the Dalai Lama and you will see that the choice of autonomy, the 'free Tibet for a free China' stance, represents everything that constitutes the Europe we are now losing: our European homeland, which we are sadly now once again turning into a Europe of nation states."
"I therefore believe it has to be said that Mr Solana should have remained silent; he has already proclaimed 'I am going to the opening ceremony'."
"Another important point is the realism shown by the Dalai Lama and by Karma Chophel, which suggests to us that we should not be raising the apocalyptic problem of non-participation in the Olympics, but taking action in the form of not endorsing the opening ceremony."
"We should be saying, through Mr Solana, 'sic stantibus rebus', we are not going, rather than continuing to present this shameful spectacle."
"For free China, for free Europe, free Tibet!"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we were all hopeful that, in view of the Olympic Games, China would demonstrate that its development was not merely that of a major economic and trading power but also that of a nation capable of embarking on a new era based on the observance of human rights which have all too often been violated, and hence a nation prepared to recognise those individual liberties still being denied today."
"Several times in recent years the Chinese Congress has spoken of the need to create a harmonious society, but those words have remained a dead letter."
"As far as Tibet is concerned, nothing has come of the autonomy guaranteed by an agreement between the parties on freedom of expression and religious worship."
"Rather, there has been an upsurge in repression, hundreds of people have died, hundreds have been wounded, and monks and citizens alike have disappeared."
"The European Union, in roundly condemning what has happened, must respond with appropriate political initiatives."
"If the Chinese authorities refuse to enter into a constructive dialogue with the Tibetans and to shed light immediately on the people who have disappeared, it will be necessary to review the economic and cooperation agreements between the EU and China."
"The attendance of political dignitaries at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games should take place only if, before then, human rights are guaranteed, trafficking in the organs of people put to death is investigated, the Tibetan monks and citizens are released, and dialogue with the Dalai Lama is initiated."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, for 10 years Europe's leaders have taken part in the Olympic Games of Indifference: running the fastest after contracts, jumping as high as possible over human rights and flying as fast as possible over the oppression in Tibet."
"That has been going on for 10 years!"
"Olympic Games in a dictatorship are a political act, whether we like it or not, whether the law likes it or not."
"What do we do in this situation?"
"When the Olympics were held in Germany in 1936, that was a political act that we all regret."
"What do we do in this situation?"
"Firstly, the European Union and all its leaders must in this situation refuse to attend the opening of the Olympic Games."
"That is a political sign, a political act that we must support."
"(Applause)"
"Secondly, these Olympic Games are going to take place."
"Forty years ago, African Americans gave the clenched-fist salute and if today an African American is perhaps going to become the President of the United States it is partly thanks to these actions at the Olympic Games."
"That has to be recognised."
"(Applause)"
"I therefore say 'yes' to civic sportsmen and sportswomen: they should be allowed to say what they want at the Olympic Games."
"I say 'yes' to civic journalists: they should watch the athletes jumping, running, swimming, but also, with white, red, black and any other banners, they should make Tiananmen Square a place of freedom, where people can say what they choose."
"Thirdly, the spectators must be civic spectators: they must go to the Olympic Games to watch their countries' athletes running, jumping and swimming, but at the same time without wanting to see gold medals hanging round their necks and blood on their shoes."
"That is the reality of Beijing today!"
"Today it is Tibet's turn and not just human rights activists, but also environmental activists."
"Tomorrow or the day after there will be the ruling on Hu Jia, and who knows what sentence he will receive."
"Why?"
"Because he was a human rights activist and an environmental activist."
"Because order reigns in Beijing."
"There are hundreds and hundreds of arrests there."
"As Greens, what we want is for everyone who goes to Beijing - I am saying this as it was said 40 years ago - to create havoc there, to speak, to say 'yes' to the Olympics but also 'yes' to freedom, and to say that the Chinese must understand or they will regret ever wanting to host the Olympics."
"If order reigns in Beijing, if everyone stays silent, if the whole world acts like the International Olympic Committees, that will be a victory for the dictatorship in Beijing and in Tibet."
"If the people speak, if we allow uncensored access to the Internet, I can tell you that it will be a great moment for the Olympic Games, for sport and for democracy, because sport and democracy must go hand in hand; otherwise, there is no point jumping, running or swimming."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the safeguarding of human rights in China does not begin and end with the Olympics."
"We did not await the Olympics to express our firm condemnation of the Chinese Government for failing to respect human rights and democratic guarantees."
"I would recall that we recently voted in this House against the proposal from the right and the conservatives to annul the embargo on arms sales to China."
"Then too, the background to that request was the desire of many Western governments not to compromise their dealings with Beijing."
"The same motive recently prompted President Bush to remove China from the list of countries committing the most severe human rights violations."
"Unfortunately, we have to realise that the old Latin proverb 'pecunia non olet' ('money does not smell') is still extremely popular with our governments."
"The only point in boycotting the Olympics would be if the West really were prepared to give observance of human rights pride of place in international relations, but in that case the European Union would not only have opposed the idea of holding the Olympics in China; it would long since have included a democratic 'observance of human rights' clause as a binding condition in trade agreements with that country."
"None of this has happened, and the aim is still to protect the interests of large Western multinationals."
"Indeed, the value of trade between the United States and China amounts to $167 billion, and that between the European Union and China to $190 billion; 24 million Chinese workers are employed by foreign franchisees."
"That is why the earth's major powers believe they should rely on China as a safety raft for their economies and tolerate its infringements of fundamental rights."
"Chinese capitalism was convinced that years of rapid economic growth would dampen separatist demands, but this has not been the case, primarily because the Chinese have never bothered to ask the Tibetans what model of economic growth they would like."
"However, Tibet is by no means the sole example of China's failure to respect human rights."
"We are witnessing on a daily basis the closure of numerous popular newspapers and international websites, increasing discrimination against migrant workers from rural areas, thousands of whom are, for example, excluded from health insurance, and thousands of members of Protestant, Catholic and unofficial churches being imprisoned and tortured, not to mention the repression of the Uyghur community, the forced labour camps and the death penalty, which is still widely applied to punish about 68 non-violent economic crimes."
"Symbolic acts are all very well, of course, but by themselves they serve only to allay our consciences."
"We are convinced that the months between now and the Olympics represent a unique opportunity for the international community, and in particular the European Union, to oblige the Beijing Government - not only diplomatically, but also through specific trade-related initiatives - to release all those who have been arrested, guarantee the independent media access to Tibet, and open negotiations with both the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile and the political movements leading the protests on the ground, in order to reach a peaceful, diplomatic, agreed solution that is respectful of the rights and choices of the Tibetan people."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for some hours the official Chinese propaganda has been saying that the situation in Tibet is under control again."
"These statements, as we know, conceal a bloody repression."
"The reaction of the European authorities is doubly appalling."
"Firstly, although we must welcome the fact that President Sarkozy is becoming increasingly vocal and is not excluding boycotting the Olympic Games, the attitude of his Foreign Affairs Minister is more than questionable."
"Bernard Kouchner has on several occasions used the expression 'our Chinese friends'."
"Does he know that this bloody dictatorship is trampling over human rights and threatening the Tibetan national identity?"
"Does he know how many political prisoners there are, the youngest in the world being the Panchen Lama?"
"We have to wonder: is it still right for him to talk about human rights on behalf of the country?"
"Since the Han Dynasty, the Chinese have believed that they are superior to the rest of the world."
"The Communist regime has only served to exacerbate this attitude by advocating an ideology that suppresses all individual and social demands and, in particular, all national demands."
"In Asia as in Europe, empires and ethnicism are the enemies of the nation."
"That is the second reason why I am appalled."
"The European leaders are guilty of a wait-and see attitude in relation to the Tibetan crisis: they who without even thinking recognised Kosovo's independence a few weeks ago."
"By imposing the pure, simple and immediate independence of this Serbian province, home of Serbia's historical and spiritual cradle, Europeans and Americans have risked provoking serious reactions and developing an inconsistent international policy."
"The policies on Kosovo and Tibet give the impression of unacceptable 'double standards', which destroy public faith in diplomatic action."
"In conclusion, if we do not take account of national heritage and traditions, if we do not ensure fair treatment of people's rights, we run the risk of seeing our proclamations on human rights being mere incantations devoid of any meaning."
"I therefore say: long live the Europe of free nations, long live the free Tibet and long live a world of free nations!"
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 113 years ago the famous French Socialist Jean Jaurès wrote that capitalism contains within it the seeds of war, as clouds foresee a tempest."
"I personally would say that communism brings with it oppression as surely as clouds bring the rain."
"Since Mao, China has thus been a slave for 60 years to one of the most terrible dictatorships in the history of mankind, and yet Mao was worshipped and acclaimed enthusiastically by much of the European intelligentsia, including the then sorcerer's apprentices who are now the current French Minister Bernard Kouchner, the philosopher André Glucksmann and many other Maoists, which should have been enough to discredit the revolutionary undertakings of 1968."
"Yes, Mr Cohn-Bendit, there were not very many of us in the 1960s and 1970s who opposed your friends at that time and their revolutionary thinking and rejected the Asian people's enslavement to the Marxism so extolled by your friends."
"Today the net has tightened somewhat from an economic point of view and the progress made in a short space of time by the Chinese, one of the most intelligent and industrious races in the world, has helped to mask the political reality, which is that it is still a dictatorship: no freedom, no real elections that are representative of the population, no independent judicial system, persecution, imprisonment, execution of political, intellectual or religious dissidents."
"Like the Mongols of Outer Mongolia, the Uyghurs or the Turkmen people of Xinjiang, Tibet is suffering this oppression that seeks to destroy its identity."
"However, everything distinguishes that identity from China's: the people, language, writing, traditions, spirituality."
"In the case of Tibet unfortunately, there is only military occupation and political repression; there is also immigration."
"You objected earlier when Kosovo was mentioned, but questions as diverse as Kosovo and Tibet have something in common: they are the consequences of the immigration policy on the indigenous people."
"These consequences are terrible, but what is even worse is that, not content with pretending this reality did not exist, we allowed this process to begin in many parts of our own territory."
"Mr President, the recent brutal suppression of the Tibetan protestors is hardly surprising, given the People's Republic of China's long track record of totally ignoring human rights and democratic freedoms."
"We here, of course, are all calling on the Beijing authorities to exercise maximum restraint and to respect the cultural autonomy and unique way of life of the Tibetan people, and to stop demonising the Dalai Lama."
"China has a lamentable history of executing more people than anywhere else in the world, including for so-called 'economic crimes'."
"It represses unregistered religious minorities and believes in state censorship, including that of the internet which, to its shame, Google has colluded with. Nevertheless, the economic might and global importance of China in security terms means that EU leaders, such as UK Prime Minister Brown on his recent visit to Beijing, are reluctant to raise these issues with the authorities for craven fear of jeopardising foreign investments."
"Nevertheless, many - in this House and elsewhere - are, understandably, now calling for a boycott of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games, if not for a total boycott of the Games themselves."
"What is more surprising, in my view, is the double standards of the West."
"Last month, many EU States and the USA - ignoring international law and citing humanitarian interventionism - unilaterally recognised the independence of Kosovo, dismembering Serbia."
"However, we in the West remain unquestioningly committed to the 'One China' policy, ignoring the rights of self-determination of democratic Taiwan to be allowed to even join the UN, even though Taiwan is an independent country de facto and has never been ruled by the PRC."
"Speaking personally, and not for my group or my national party: surely, for the EU, re-examining the 'One China' policy would be a far more effective way of signalling our displeasure for the Chinese brutal Communist dictatorship."
"Mr President, since 10 March, unprecedented demonstrations have taken place in Tibet and at least three Chinese provinces, and in Beijing."
"The Chinese Government claims that 18 civilians and one policeman were killed and a total of 623 people injured during the protests in Lhasa on 12 March."
"Tibetan exile groups have reported that at least 800 people died during the protests."
"The Economist correspondent who was in Lhasa as the riots broke out reported on the scale of destruction and violence."
"First of all, the European Parliament should call on the Chinese Government - as Human Rights Watch rightly demands - to lift its lockdown of all Tibetan areas, including full media access; account for the missing and dead from this month's protests; publish the names of all individuals and their places of detention; and give immediate access to independent monitors, who can investigate whether detainees are being tortured or mistreated."
"Secondly, we urge the Chinese Government to enter into constructive dialogue with the Dalai Lama."
"The Tibetan community and the Dalai Lama himself also need to think about the security and feasible future of the Han Chinese in Tibet."
"My last point is that there is now a great responsibility on all international actors in the current situation - particularly the sponsors of the Olympic torch, such as Coca Cola, Samsung and Lenovo - not to associate themselves with the highly repressive situation in the region."
"(NL) You have quite rightly pointed out, Mr President, Commissioner, that human rights have never been a purely domestic issue."
"Wherever human rights are violated, we in the European Parliament must object to such violations and bring charges in every case."
"It is, therefore, a good thing that we have good relations, economic as well as political, with the Chinese authorities."
"Now we must use these relations, through you, Mr President, and through every delegation that goes there, every parliamentary committee or delegation such as mine, which maintains relations with China."
"We must use them first of all to ensure that press can do its job and provide us with reliable information from Tibet."
"I also want to ask you, Commissioner, to send people from our delegation in Beijing to Tibet as quickly as possible, to submit a request to send a delegation of people there, today if possible."
"They need to go to Lhasa to see what things are like there, what happens to people who have been arrested and what is happening at the blockaded monasteries."
"You have people available in Beijing."
"Please make that request and let us know what happens so that we can find out what is going on in situ."
"(PL) Mr President, Tibet is just one small part of a much greater plan."
"Currently, China is deliberately supporting each and every one of the authoritarian regimes in the world, from Burma through to Belarus and Sudan."
"Chinese ideologues have made no secret of the fact that they wish to offer the world an alternative to the liberal and democratic road to development."
"The fact that China has become the epicentre of authoritarianism is not a simply a regional problem for Tibet, Taiwan or the Uyghur people."
"This epicentre of authoritarianism is making its presence felt ever more strongly in the world, at the expense of Europe itself and of the United States."
"This is therefore the last opportunity to depart from a passive policy."
"All European governments should act in unison and boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games."
"These Games must lead to the downfall of Chinese policy, otherwise they will lead to the downfall of the entire free world."
"(DE) Mr President, the brutal action taken by the Chinese military against Tibetan demonstrators has resulted in more than 1 000 people being injured and, it is thought, some 100 deaths among the Tibetans."
"Shocking images have come to light despite the news blackouts and the expulsion of journalists."
"It is quite obvious that China is miles away from any kind of suitability as an Olympic host."
"The fact is that one of the criteria for the choice of Beijing as the venue for the Games - respect for human and minority rights - has not been fulfilled."
"Yet again, however, IOC President Jacques Rogge has omitted to voice any criticism of this situation."
"At the lighting of the Olympic flame in Athens - just like a year ago in his speech at Tiananmen Square - Mr Rogge has once again failed to make any reference whatsoever to the current situation."
"Of course the athletes have been preparing for the Games, and their efforts should not be for nothing."
"President Pöttering was quite right to describe a boycott as the last resort if the Chinese fail to effect major changes by August."
"As President of the European Parliament's Tibet Intergroup, I fully endorse this position."
"I would like to express my gratitude for the solidarity that we are seeing very clearly today."
"I hope, too, that our athletes, who are responsible adults, will not shy away from speaking out at any time and will utilise the presence of some 20 000 journalists."
"Of course the Olympic Games offer political options."
"Perhaps all the athletes could wear a black ribbon as a sign of mourning."
"The Chinese have miscalculated: we Europeans will not look away."
"The European Parliament, as the champion of human rights, spoke out immediately."
"The Slovenian Presidency voiced its protest yesterday, in fact, at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I would like to see the European Commission convene a special session within the framework of the EU-China dialogue."
"EU observers must be sent to Tibet without delay in order to obtain an objective impression of the situation there."
"In China, there are not only hardliners and not only nationalists."
"I place my hopes in the reasonable people who are well aware that there is no moving forward without the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetans."
"There is no alternative to the Dalai Lama's peaceful path."
"Only then can an Olympic spirit develop at all."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the core issue in the current crisis in Tibet is not only about oppression, it is also about secession."
"The violence in Tibet today is not only about human rights but also about power-sharing."
"The lack of transparency is deplorable, as much as the provocative measures are manoeuvres."
"Certainly we must ask the Chinese authorities to deal with these events in compliance with respect for human rights in a civilised, transparent and proportionate way."
"At the same time, we must also recognise the right of China and the right of any state to take appropriate measures to protect the lives, freedoms and fortunes of its citizens as well as the public good."
"Undoubtedly, China is not organised in accordance with European principles and values of democracy and human rights."
"However, one cannot deny the opening-up of China in a Chinese evolution convergent with some of our values."
"It is our right and duty to encourage that process and to insist on respect for human rights, including cultural rights and the protection of cultural identity everywhere in China, not only in Tibet."
"Likewise, we should support democratic freedoms against both autocracy and theocracy."
"However, in doing that, we must bear in mind that excessive pressure is more likely to slow down the reforms rather than to speed them up."
"In this period, we should ask all those concerned not to make human rights the hostage of geostrategic agendas or to make the Olympic Games the hostage of political ambitions."
"The Olympic Games should be a well-used opportunity for us to speak about peace, freedom and human dignity all over the world, in China first and foremost."
"(FR) Mr President, the crime in Tibet is equivalent to a crime against the European spirit and ideas."
"Silence is a crime in certain situations."
"I am pleased, Mr President, that your words today have broken the European Union's silence and that enables me to address you, Mr President."
"The people of Poland have experience not only of fighting for freedom but also of the round table, which became the instrument of that fight."
"I ask you, Mr President, to launch an initiative for a round table that would bring together, around you, the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize, the representatives of Tibet and Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama; you could invite the President of the Chinese Congress and the Chinese authorities."
"This would be a goodwill gesture that could launch the necessary dialogue and debate."
"I believe, Mr President, that this House is grateful to you for your words here today."
"It would also be grateful to you for a new initiative, an initiative for dialogue and peace."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Geremek."
"I will raise this issue with the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"It is not something that I can decide on my own, so I will put it to them."
"(PL) Mr President, we are today debating the next stage of the extermination of the Tibetan nation."
"Tibet has never been part of China on a permanent basis."
"The Tibetan people lived in isolation from the rest of the world and essentially enjoyed independence throughout the course of history."
"I have to say that the statements by the representatives of the Council and of the Commission urging both sides to engage in dialogue are regrettable, because they confuse the victim with the perpetrator, as has become quite fashionable of late."
"Mr President, I welcome your suggestion to arrange a boycott of the opening ceremony, and I call on others to act according to your example."
"I should like to point out that Point 5 of the Preamble to the Olympic Charter states that any form of discrimination is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement."
"Accordingly, as we are unable to expel China from the International Olympic Movement, we should make our position clear through a boycott."
"Mr President, the Olympic flame may have been lit last weekend, but the Olympic spirit died in the streets of Tibet."
"It was killed by the most repressive regime on earth."
"China sponsors genocide in Darfur, genocide against religious groups in China, and now genocide in Tibet."
"For politicians of principle it is no longer a question of whether there should be a boycott of the Olympics, but what sort of boycott."
"After my last visit to China in May 2006, all whom I had contact with - ex-prisoners, reformists and so-on - were arrested, imprisoned and, in some cases, tortured."
"I am thinking of Gao Zhisheng, of Hu Jia, of Sao Dong and others."
"This is the real China."
"That is why I called then for a debate in the EU about a boycott of the Olympics."
"This debate shows that the free world, as colleagues have made clear, cannot and should not shake hands with murderers."
"It is not just, as the President of this House has courageously said, a question of not attending the opening Olympic ceremony."
"There are wider questions to be answered about the nature of the Olympics themselves."
"The Olympic Charter, in Article 1, talks about universal, fundamental, ethical principles."
"The Chinese, in 2001 when they accepted the Olympic Games in 2008, made commitments to reform."
"Nothing has been done."
"This Parliament asked, in a resolution in December - unanimously - that the IOC should make an assessment of China's progress to reform."
"Nothing has been done."
"The IOC must speak up."
"Parliament has begun a debate which will echo around the world, and I thank the President for initiating it."
"We will come to 'catch the eye' in a moment, but Minister Lenarčič has to leave, so I will ask him to take the floor once again briefly."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you very much, Mr President, for allowing me to speak at this moment."
"I would also like to thank the Members of Parliament for their opinions, suggestions and initiatives put forward in this debate."
"As Mrs Napoletano and others mentioned, the Foreign Ministers will be meeting informally at the end of this week."
"That will be an opportunity to exchange opinions on Tibet, which was the topic of today's debate in this House, and your opinions, suggestions and initiatives will be very useful."
"The opinions and positions of Members of Parliament will be taken into account as far as possible."
"I should stress that the Council will strive to speak with one voice."
"The Presidency will endeavour to make the Council's statement clear."
"The Council will be clear in its stance on the respect of human rights, the rejection of violence wherever it comes from, and support for the freedom of expression, including the right to peaceful demonstration."
"As I said in my introduction, we will work in favour of dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama or his representatives."
"We will continue to maintain contacts with our Chinese counterparts regarding permission for international journalists to visit Tibet."
"I have already mentioned the statements of the Ministers for Sport regarding the Olympic Games."
"They said nothing about the opening ceremony."
"Perhaps other Ministers will address that issue in due course."
"I would like to reiterate that the Olympic Games in China should be viewed as an opportunity to promote human rights."
"Thank you, Minister."
"Please have the courage to convey to the Foreign Ministers a strong message about the situation as reflected in our debate and the mood here in the European Parliament."
"Thank you for your participation today."
"(PL) Mr President, the centuries-old Olympic tradition goes hand in hand with the notions of peace and non-violence."
"It is therefore shameful that in the country that is to host the Olympics in a few months' time, people are being shot at and those who wish to express publicly their aspirations as citizens are being killed."
"It was good that this state of affairs was roundly condemned in the House today during the debate, which is now drawing to a close."
"In particular, I should like to congratulate the President of the European Parliament for his very strong statement."
"At the same time, I should like to draw attention to the fact that in a country that is our immediate neighbour, namely Belarus, force is also being used to break up peaceful demonstrations and participants in the latter are being arrested."
"Fortunately no weapons have been used there."
"I believe that we should make it abundantly clear that we condemn events in Minsk just as strongly as we condemn events in Tibet."
"(NL) The recent violence in Tibet has again drawn our attention to the position of the Tibetan people."
"The situation there regarding missing persons and the dead or wounded is very unclear."
"China must clarify this and allow international organisations and the media to enter the area."
"This summer the Olympic Games will be held in China."
"The Games stand for peace and respect."
"The Games are an outstanding opportunity for the Chinese people to come into contact with sporting and cultural values from the rest of the world."
"Athletes have a crucial role to play in this."
"Governments ought not to interfere at this time in their athletes' participation in the Games."
"Athletes can and must decide that for themselves."
"On the other hand, politicians can distance themselves from the opening festivities."
"I support the President of the European Parliament's idea of possibly boycotting the opening ceremony."
"It is crucial that the Member States act collectively with regard to this matter."
"The European Parliament must take the initiative in this respect."
"Mr President, I cannot say I was planning a trip to China this summer, but now I certainly will not be going."
"Furthermore, I would suggest to my fellow Europeans, including our visitors in the gallery and all of my colleagues here, that we spread the word that it would be better to spend this summer in Europe."
"(PT) I, too, welcome the debate and comments on this issue."
"I believe that we should not hold back on a single accusation or a single demand for respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights."
"I must also therefore express my solidarity with Tibet, with the Tibetan people and with the Dalai Lama, whose words once again point to the right way forward."
"In addition, I must express my solidarity with the Chinese people who are fighting for freedom everyday, with the sons and daughters of Tiananmen."
"However, having said this, I am not in favour of a boycott of the Olympic Games."
"I would prefer a clearer and firmer policy at trade level and in our political relations, because that is where we must act, not at the cost of sport and relations between people who are trying to promote human rights and freedom."
"That is what we want."
"I favour political measures, for example the absence of political leaders from the opening ceremony."
"However, I believe that we must continue to fight for and put pressure on China to open up, rather than encourage it to shut itself off."
"I believe that these Olympic Games will raise global awareness and will advance the causes of human rights, Tibet, Darfur and all those fighting for freedom and peace in the world."
"(DE) Mr President, China has been violating human rights on a massive scale in Tibet for years."
"Whenever a communist dictatorship runs out of ideas, it sends in the tanks and troops."
"I learned this harsh lesson myself 40 years ago in Prague, and now we are seeing the same thing happen in Lhasa."
"The struggle for freedom and democracy in Tibet, in China, in Burma and elsewhere continues."
"We must consider using all the instruments at our disposal, perhaps even a phased boycott of the Olympic Games."
"We also urge the Council to appoint an EU Special Envoy for Tibet at last."
"Long live free Tibet!"
"Mr President, the way the Chinese authorities are addressing the crisis in Tibet is proof that Beijing is unwilling to change its ruthless policies towards minorities."
"It is cowardly and dishonest to claim the Dalai Lama is inspiring the riots."
"I am proud of you, Mr President, for courageously taking a clear moral stand on the Tibetan issue and today declaring our unconditional solidarity with the Tibetan people."
"Speaking about the Olympic Games, I think it is opportune to recall that seven years ago, in July 2001, this Parliament concluded that China 'clearly fails to uphold universal human, civil and political rights' and 'that this negative record and the repression in Tibet ... make it inappropriate' for China to become the host of the 2008 Olympic Games."
"Sadly, real life has proved the correctness of this conclusion."
"I call upon the Commission and Council to demonstrate the same measure of solidarity with Tibet as has been demonstrated today in this Chamber."
"Mr President, we cannot be silent before the killings in Tibet and the Chinese attempts to hide their extent."
"Nor can we, of course, condone the anti-Han and anti-Hui racist violence which erupted in Tibet and neighbouring Chinese provinces, as much as we do not condone the racist slurs against Tibetans echoed in China."
"But we all, including the Chinese people, should understand why Tibetans reacted violently, despite the Dalai Lama's peaceful stance."
"That outburst is due to the long-standing humiliations, pain and gross human rights violations endured by the Tibetans in Tibet, where they are becoming a minority as a result of the aggressive policies of Beijing."
"We call for human rights and freedoms in Tibet as much as in China, where so many are jailed just for daring to express their views - like Hu Jia, just after he spoke to us here in Parliament last November."
"Because I care, I do not support calls for a boycott of the Olympic Games in Beijing."
"It would just be too convenient for those who continue to count on world indifference to go on oppressing the Chinese and the Tibetans."
"Instead, it is a task for us all, as citizens of this world, to make these Games in Beijing become a true Olympiad for human rights, for freedom in Tibet, and for freedom in China."
"(PL) On the same day as the first partially free elections were taking place in Poland, namely 4 June 1989, tanks were running down student demonstrators in Tiananmen Square."
"The regime responsible for those events trades with its own citizens' organs."
"It is currently murdering Tibetans."
"I cannot understand how China was ever allowed to organise the Olympic Games."
"I support the request to organise an observation mission to Tibet."
"Mr President, the recent events in Tibet have been atrocious, despicable and we all condemn them, as we should condemn many other acts of inhumanity by the totalitarian regime in China."
"But, at the same time as we condemn them, we still trade in billions of euros with China."
"Nobody in this House today has said that we should take action to hurt the Chinese totalitarian regime where it will feel the pain most, which is in economic terms."
"The Commissioner here has in the past defended in this House the position that we should not take any embargo economic action against China."
"So let us not kill the Olympic spirit."
"Let us not destroy it, but let us try to destroy the dictatorship in Beijing and let all of us stop buying Chinese if we want to do something practical."
"(CS) I have been pointing out for several years now that we must not close our eyes to a gross breach of human rights in China, regardless of our economic goals."
"Tibet is the tip of the Chinese iceberg."
"I fully support the belief of the President of Parliament, Mr Hans-Gert Pöttering, that if China continues with its cultural genocide against the Tibetan people, boycotting the Olympic Games would be justified."
"European politicians should express their disapproval with Chinese politics through non-attendance at the opening ceremony."
"Politics is about symbols and gestures, and this would be a fitting gesture for European politicians, presidents and prime ministers."
"Not only for me personally but for many Europeans this will be a test showing whether the European Union treats human rights as a transnational issue and a matter that touches us all, or whether it is going to take selective approach in the case of China."
"I am very much in favour of the idea of sending our own observers to Tibet."
"Allow me to make one more small comment: I do not like the fact that these days we can neither freely fly the Tibetan flag nor bring it along to any action with links to the Olympics."
"The Olympic idea is based on the purity of a sporting spirit and this spirit most certainly does not go together with the silence of other countries during the Olympics about the fact that the organising country brutally suppresses the rights of the Tibetan people."
"(FI) Mr President, the 2008 Olympics are a unique opportunity for Europe to initiate a debate on the events in Tibet and the universal humanitarian values agreed by the United Nations."
"Pressure must be put on China to keep the promises it has made in exchange for hosting the Olympic Games."
"China must allow the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights into Tibet to carry out a thorough and impartial investigation into the events there to date."
"The actors involved in development cooperation as well as the international press have to be guaranteed access to Tibet."
"China's civil rights activists must be allowed to act without the threat of arrest."
"Now there is also an opportunity to support the worthy non-violent struggle on the part of the Tibetan leader and their exiled spiritual leader to achieve autonomous status."
"China will be more inclined to listen to us right now than ever before or after the Olympics."
"We should not exclude the option of a boycott if it helps to achieve results."
"(DE) Mr President, may I say that the Olympic Games are always a major sporting event, but always a political event as well, both for the IOC, and in this case also for China, because of the pledges that were made by the Chinese in connection with the Games, namely that they would respect human rights and ensure better protection of the environment."
"In my view, they have yet to honour either of these pledges."
"In fact, the human rights situation has seriously deteriorated and we need to react to that."
"For that reason, I, too, believe that Europe should not be sending its Heads of State or Government to the opening ceremony."
"However, we need to go further than that."
"We need to have a genuinely European policy on China."
"A strategic partnership is impossible to implement in full while these massive human rights violations are occurring, and so I would ask that we continue the dialogue but confront the Chinese with what they are doing and not allow any hypocrisy."
"That means that when Angela Merkel, for example, meets the Dalai Lama, Sarkozy should not then be travelling to China to sell the TGV and nuclear power plants without once mentioning the word 'human rights'."
"The yardstick by which we, as Europeans, must be gauging our own performance is our human rights dimension, including in our dealings with China."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must help the Dalai Lama not only to say 'no', where he has clearly done so, but also to say 'yes' where he has done so."
"He has said 'no' to independence; he has said 'yes' to autonomy, and it is with this proposal that he should be given help."
"He has said 'no' to violence; he has said 'yes' to non-violence, which means being proactive and may entail collective action: it is a policy which calls for knowledge, for an independent international inquiry to find out what really happened and is happening in Tibet."
"He has said 'no' to a boycott of the Olympics, but 'yes' to whatever can be done to use this as an opportunity for the international community to make its political voice heard in favour of human rights."
"Chairman Karma Chophel, who is about to speak to us in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, has also spoken of the need for everyone to take this opportunity to show support for the Tibetan people and for all oppressed peoples in China: the Uyghurs, the Mongols and others."
"Therefore, Mr Solana was undoubtedly too quick off the mark - as the Council has also said - in taking a stance, in signalling his intention to attend, without having a mandate from the Council and without having heard the opinion of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I had the good fortune to be present as a spectator at the Munich Olympic Games the day before the tragic assassinations of athletes took place."
"I know how hard Germany tried - and was successful - in effacing the memory of the Berlin Olympic Games."
"I remember as well, of course, the Olympic Games in America, where some of the American athletes who were victorious on the podium rose with black gloves on their hands and wearing black socks."
"In other words, the Olympic Games in its modern manifestation has always found it very difficult to avoid political events imposing themselves on what is meant to be a celebration of sport and of peace."
"It might be that the Olympic Committee - and we have colleagues here in this House who sit on that committee - might consider that the flying of national flags is actually not in the Olympic spirit, and that it should be the Olympic flag which is flown."
"As far as the Chinese authorities are concerned, I wholly agree with your words."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe one measure that can be adopted is for the European Union to ask the UN to ensure immunity from arrest for athletes of Tibetan nationality wishing to participate in the Olympic Games under their own flag and on behalf of their nation."
"It is shameful that a country with which the entire world, including European nations, trades and does business should take the liberty of upholding its right to host the Olympic Games and obtaining the attendance of Heads of State and Government at the opening ceremony, while it is drenching in blood the freedom of its citizens, of an oppressed nation under military occupation and suffering bloody persecution."
"The Tibetan people have a right to freedom and independence."
"(HU) Mr President, your excellent statement and the present debate show that the European Parliament does not want to remain silent, that it does not want to collude with a dictatorship's oppression of a minority."
"We know that it is very difficult to exert pressure on a country like China that carries great weight in global politics, and it is better to persuade them to negotiate with the Dalai Lama on Tibet's situation."
"The Chinese had the wisdom to find a solution in the case of Hong Kong and Macao based on the principle of 'one country, two systems'."
"This might be one way of resolving the present situation too: for Tibet to be part of China, but having very wide-ranging autonomy under the leadership of the Dalai Lama, because the current level of autonomy falls short of what the Tibetan people want."
"Mr Geremek has provided a framework for this, and I would like to put forward an idea: let us try to persuade the Chinese that there is indeed a feasible solution that would maintain China's territorial integrity while at the same time providing the Tibetan people with the autonomy they deserve."
"Mr President, I am proud of you as the President of this Parliament."
"(SK) Thank you, Mr President."
"I have some quite fresh impressions from my visit to China last week."
"Our European Parliament delegation mentioned Tibet at every opportunity, at every meeting with the Chinese, in the Chinese Congress, at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
"The Chinese were very nervous and did not allow any discussion about this issue."
"I could see how preparations for the Olympic Games are progressing, how they have become a part of life of every Chinese citizen."
"That is why it is so regrettable that the Chinese Government has not grasped the main mission of the Olympic Games."
"Had it understood, it would not have sent convoys of Chinese army vehicles with thousands of soldiers to Tibet and neighbouring provinces."
"The Tibetan people are devoted Buddhists whose religion is continuously oppressed by the government."
"I consider the Chinese official policy towards Tibet to be genocide: an effort to destroy Tibetan culture and religion."
"I am happy that we are hearing today in this democratic House a strong call for support for Tibet, a clear call for protection of the sanctity of the wonderful values of the Olympic Games and for a boycott of the opening ceremony. Thank you."
"Mr President, in my view the European Union should have three objectives regarding Tibet and China."
"The first is the immediate objective to end the violence, murders and especially torture happening in Tibet."
"Torture is at present a much bigger problem than murders because for 50 years it has furthered the oppression in Tibet."
"The second more mid-term objective is of course linked to the Olympic Games."
"We still have five months to make sure that China fulfils its commitments."
"Five months is a lot of time and it is now a very good time to make sure that the Olympic Games' political goals - which were the reason why China got the Olympic Games - are really fulfilled."
"Finally, the most important thing is that the high-level talks between the Dalai Lama's representatives and the Chinese Government really can continue."
"Since the talks began there has been very little progress."
"I think that the European Union could give more support to the Dalai Lama to reach, in these peaceful talks, a really sustainable future for an autonomous Tibet."
"Mr President, following Mr Kelam's remarks about Parliament's warning seven years ago, we have to consider what, if anything, has changed in China as regards Tibet since that time, and whether Parliament's position has changed."
"If nothing has changed, then what was said seven years ago should be reiterated now: 'It is inappropriate'."
"We therefore call on the Member States to behave properly."
"I do not think that Parliament is any less the voice of Europe now than it was then."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in conclusion, I would firstly like to say that this discussion has clearly shown that you have very strongly understood the frustration of the Tibetan people."
"This has been a very passionate discussion."
"I will certainly take back to the Council of Foreign Ministers the sentiments expressed in this discussion today."
"As I said, the Council has to have a debate on this issue."
"The core of this item for me is how to achieve concrete improvements in the situation in Tibet."
"I understand the Chinese sensitivities on sovereignty but it is also fair to ask for respect for Tibetan culture and traditions."
"We have reminded the Chinese time and again that its role as an emerging power and host of the Olympic Games also entails responsibility."
"My message therefore is: firstly, stop the violence."
"Violence has never, as I said before, achieved long-lasting results."
"Secondly, engage in a substantive and constructive dialogue which addresses core issues such as what can be done to preserve the Tibetan language, culture, religion and traditions; what steps need to be undertaken so that Tibetans may enjoy equal opportunities in education, in working life, the economy and society; what must be done or not done so that Tibetans can still feel at home in their own region."
"If these questions are answered, then the ghost of separatism might disappear and the right solution might be found."
"No one can have an interest in the situation heating up further or people being radicalised and a lasting solution becoming less and less likely."
"I think all sides should aim to strengthen the moderate elements, and I therefore strongly recommend addressing these questions together, in order to find a sustainable solution acceptable to all."
"What we have been doing - and what we can do - is to have a human rights dialogue, as I said."
"In this dialogue, by the way, the question of torture is always clearly put on the table."
"Here again, as I have mentioned, we will ask for a special field mission."
"We think this is important."
"Secondly, I will take up the question that has been asked before: for our own delegation also to request a visit to Tibet."
"I hope there is a chance, because - as I said earlier - there are journalists who have been admitted now, so hopefully our European Community will be there."
"That is what I can tell you."
"Thank you very much. I think it was a very important debate."
"Many thanks, Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think this has been one of the European Parliament's finest hours, for we have championed the most important cause of all, namely human rights."
"I think we can be grateful not only that we have come together for this debate - although for procedural reasons we cannot formally vote on a resolution; that is something we will be doing in April - but also that we have signalled very clearly that we are on the side of the Tibetan people."
"My appeal to you, and my advice - and I am confident that this will happen - is that we continue to observe what is happening in China and Tibet with our eyes open, and continue to raise our voices against the violation of human rights in Tibet and, indeed, elsewhere in the world."
"I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of you for your contribution to what has been one of the European Parliament's finest hours."
"Every Member who signalled under 'catch the eye' that they wished to speak has been able to do so."
"I think it is important, in such a passionate and important debate, that anyone who wishes to voice their opinion should be able to do so."
"My heartfelt thanks go out to you for that reason too."
"I hope our debate meets with favourable resonance in the European Union and beyond."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I am sure you will convey to the Council of Foreign Ministers the mood of this debate as well as our passion and commitment to the cause of human rights."
"I wish you every success as you do so, and trust that the Council of Foreign Ministers will also draw tangible conclusions, just as we have done from this debate."
"I now declare the debate closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) The Tibetan crisis fills all of us with alarm and we sympathise with the victims."
"The Chinese government must protect human rights and not resort to violence."
"The Dalai Lama is asking for autonomy for Tibet and I believe this proposal is a wise and appropriate one."
"Based on its rich cultural, historical and religious traditions, Tibet certainly deserves autonomy."
"Autonomy could provide a solution to similar historical and ethnic conflicts in many other countries in the world."
"At the same time, I believe it is very important not to mix politics and sport."
"The boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics were a bitter chapter in the Cold War."
"Outstanding sportspeople missed out on an opportunity to prove themselves, and whole nations deprived themselves of the joy of Olympic participation."
"I can say without a doubt that the vast majority of the sports-loving Hungarian public was opposed to the 1984 boycott and would oppose any suggestion of a boycott in the present case."
"Let us stand by the Tibetans in political terms, but let us not ruin the joy of sport for hundreds of millions of people."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, I share everyone's concern about the human rights violations in Tibet."
"China is a member of the United Nations and has ratified several international agreements."
"It has nevertheless fulfilled its obligations only very imperfectly."
"Although the world's eyes are on China because of the approaching Olympic Games, its government is now using harsh means to silence anyone who criticises its policies and to quash peaceful demonstrations."
"The kind of Stalinist rhetoric used by Zhang Qingli, Secretary of the Communist Party of China Tibet Autonomous (so-called) Regional Committee, allows us to suspect the worst."
"Other countries should not condone these widespread political and human rights breaches."
"The European Union should immediately amend the cooperation plan to take account of the current situation and step up the human rights dialogue with China, which should make it possible to achieve results."
"We should now make a special effort to ensure that the Tibetan regions are opened up to supplies and development aid workers."
"The sieges in the monasteries must be brought to an end and the Tibetan people must be assured of the supply of food, water and medical treatment."
"Recognised human rights organisations and official agencies must also be allowed into the area to monitor the human rights situation, something which China has refused to do, despite requests and pressure from a large number of international agencies."
"We also need to insist that China should release the Tibetans who have been arrested in peaceful demonstrations, respect freedom of expression and assembly, and lift the restrictions on the practice of religion."
"The Dalai Lama has spoken in the media of Tibet's cultural genocide."
"The only sustainable help or solution will be that which brings fundamental rights, economic well-being, freedom of speech and religion, and genuine cultural autonomy to the Tibetans."
"in writing. - (IT) The world has tolerated China's bullying of the Tibetan people and culture for decades, for reasons of geopolitical opportunism."
"Now, disgracefully, we are refraining from putting pressure on the Asian powerhouse, which continues to infringe human rights."
"The international silence or complicity derives more from commercial and financial expediency than geopolitical tactics."
"This unexpected inclusion on the agenda, which moreover testifies merely to a formalistic interest in the issue, is not going to restore in people like myself - who have always condemned China's arrogance - the hope that the EU will not only express verbal condemnation but impose sanctions."
"Such sanctions must go much further than the question of the Olympics, even though the Eastern Bloc countries behaved differently on the occasion of the Moscow Games."
"I therefore feel ashamed to be a citizen of a craven Union, the same one that only a few days ago ignored international law by recognising the independence of Kosovo, just as I was ashamed of the Italian Government and almost all of Italy's political parties - majority and opposition alike - which acceded to China's request not to grant the Dalai Lama an official reception when he visited Italy."
"Our governments are slaves to the market, devotees of free trade and communism, and will always be opposed by free-thinking citizens like myself who will continue to protest against injustice."
"in writing. - (HU) Mr President, the disturbances in Tibet have left several hundred people dead."
"China only mentions thirteen."
"One death is too many."
"The Tibetan demonstrators were allegedly shot in self-defence."
"The Chinese Premier blames the Dalai Lama for the situation that has arisen."
"It is a familiar story."
"A Communist country riding roughshod over human rights."
"A minority fighting for its rights, calling for the autonomy it has been promised, but which has been taken from it."
"There has been talk of a boycott, of non-attendance, but also of conciliation and dialogue."
"If nothing happens, then at the very least the Olympic flame should not pass through Tibetan territory."
"I would also ask you, however, whether we can carry the flame through the whole of Europe with a clear conscience?"
"In many European countries even today, people still get beaten up because they speak a different language from the majority, minority leaders are given all the blame for a situation that has arisen, and human rights and the rights of communities to self-determination are a taboo subject."
"We must speak up for the rights of the Tibetan people, but let Europe also set its own house in order."

"Order of business"
"The final draft agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 3 April 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been requested to this draft."
"Thursday:"
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the report by Mrs Jäätteenmäki on the Statute of the European Ombudsman be postponed until the next part-session in Strasbourg and that voting time be brought forward to 11 a.m."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, that is indeed our wish."
"This is not because the report is a bad one - I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group, too, on a very good report - but there are still one or two critical issues unresolved."
"We should like to be able to discuss these in peace, which is the reason for our motion; and, as the President has just said, if the House were to agree to it, we could then vote at 11 a.m. - but this is not the reason."
"Mr President, for form's sake, I should like to notify my fellow Members on this occasion that I shall also be putting forward a motion - not now, but tomorrow - that the vote on the report on FYROM, or Macedonia, likewise be postponed until the Strasbourg sitting."
"I shall state the reasons for this tomorrow; I just wanted to let my fellow Members know now."
"Here, too, there is just one small unresolved issue."
"This is our group's wish."
"Would anyone like to speak in favour of the motion?"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I believe Mr Swoboda's argument was admittedly brief, but it was concise."
"There are indeed one or two aspects, and therefore I, too, am in favour of postponement."
"Who speaks against the motion?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the committee agreed the Jäätteenmäki report to strengthen the powers of the Ombudsman by 19 votes in favour to none against."
"It is a question we have discussed for some time. It seems to me now to be quite extraordinary and, indeed, deplorable that the PSE and PPE-DE Groups have acquired cold feet upon the important question of the Ombudsman."
"The transparency of Parliament depends upon improving the Statute of the European Ombudsman."
"The Presidency is requesting that we fast-track the question for conclusion, and I would strongly urge Parliament to press on with the agenda as agreed."
"(Parliament approved the proposal by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament)"
"The order of business is thus adopted."
"Welcome"
"I am now pleased to be able to welcome to the visitors' gallery a high-level delegation from the Turkish Parliament, which has come to Brussels on a three-day study trip."
"It includes Mr Nihat Ergün, Deputy Chairman of the AK Party, Mr Yaşar Yakiş, Chairman of the EU Harmonisation Committee, and Mr Sait Açba, Chairman of the Planning and Budget Committee."
"(Applause)"
"We wish you a pleasant stay and fruitful discussions with representatives of the European Parliament, Commission and Council."
"A warm welcome to the European Parliament!"
"1."
"Approving the appointment of Mrs Androula Vassiliou as a Member of the Commission ("
"After the vote:"
"(FR) Mr President, please excuse me, I may be mistaken but I thought that when votes were about people they had to remain secret, which has not been the case."
"However, maybe because this is about members of the Commission, that is not the case."
"I do not know. Anyway, this has been public because my fellow Members' lights have been lit differently according to whether they voted for, against or abstained."
"Mr Gollnisch, you are completely right in the second part of your conclusion: it was a roll-call vote, and it is in the nature of roll-call votes that we can identify by name how each Member voted."
"Voting time"
"The next item is voting time."
"(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Lebanon (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Lebanon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in connection with the situation in Lebanon, diplomatic activities of the European Union and the Member States remain focused on advancing the cause of peace, stability, economic development and respect for human rights in Lebanon."
"We are making efforts to preserve and strengthen the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, unity and stability of Lebanon."
"The European Union upholds the Lebanese democratic institutions and the legitimate government of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora."
"However, we are concerned because of the long-term paralysis of the Lebanese institutions."
"This has been going on since November 2006, and when in November 2007 the President's position became vacant, the paralysis became even more critical."
"Apart from being the largest financial donor to Lebanon, the European Union has been making efforts through intensive diplomatic activities also to find a solution for the country's political paralysis."
"Within this framework we support the efforts of the United Nations, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League."
"Thus the European Union upheld the three-part plan, which the foreign ministers of the Arab League unanimously adopted."
"As is well known, this plan envisages the immediate election of a president, the forming of a government of national unity, and the adoption of a new elections act."
"In spite of expressing support for this plan, the Lebanese political parties differ in their interpretation of its execution."
"There are two main obstacles for the realisation of the proposal."
"The first one is internal, because the parties cannot reach an agreement regarding their representation in the government, the sharing of ministerial posts, and the new law on elections."
"The second obstacle is connected with Syria, which refuses to give up its influence in Lebanon."
"In spite of everything, the plan of the Arab League is, at this point in time, still the only initiative which can contribute to the resolution of the political impasse in the country."
"We expect that the General Secretary of the Arab League, Mr Moussa, will continue with his efforts to resolve the existing situation."
"In this respect the European Union will provide him with every support."
"The recent summit of the Arab League, held in Damascus at the end of March, regretfully did not bring the desired results required for the resolution of the situation."
"Because of Syria's interference in the presidential election procedure, Lebanon expressed its protest by not sending their representative to the summit."
"In connection with this, I should like to emphasise the commitment of the European Union to the viewpoints set out in a number United Nations Security Council resolutions."
"Another demonstration of the European Union's support of the efforts of the United Nations is its participation in the UN mission in Lebanon."
"Member States have contributed the largest share of the military force in Lebanon."
"Despite numerous attacks, during which six members of the Spanish contingent were killed and three Irish soldiers were wounded, the mission has been successful, and in August 2007 it was extended for another year."
"European Union Member States also support the establishment of the special United Nations Court for Lebanon in the Netherlands."
"Also worth mentioning is that in 2007 the EU-Lebanon Action Plan came into effect."
"This instrument is an upgrading of the existing cooperation within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Committee for the Barcelona Process, and activities within this framework have already commenced."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament for including Lebanon on today's agenda."
"Many other developments in the Middle East - especially events in Gaza - have recently occupied our attention. This should, however, not make us forget the strategic importance of Lebanon for the region and as a partner of Europe."
"The present situation in Lebanon is extremely worrying."
"The deep political crisis continues: on 24 March, the parliamentary session to elect a President was postponed for the 17th time since November 2007."
"The Summit of the Arab League in Damascus has not delivered a solution either."
"While the security situation has remained relatively calm with no major incidents, public tension and anxiety have increased."
"Violence could break out at any moment as the political crisis goes on, with unforeseeable consequences for the country and its people."
"Indications that Hizbollah has replenished its military capacity since 2006 are worrying, especially in the light of the recent threats against Israel, following the death of Imad Mugniyeh."
"Moreover, the protracted crisis is having a very negative impact on the socio-economic situation in Lebanon."
"As you are aware, Europe is active at many different levels to help Lebanon: we remain the biggest contributor to UNIFIL, and the European Union has also been the most important donor at the Paris III Conference."
"We have been firmly supporting the Arab League's Initiative since it was launched in January 2008 and our Community instruments have allowed us to provide a targeted response to some of the major challenges."
"The European Neighbourhood Policy has developed into a major instrument to support Lebanon's reform process and to contribute to economic and social stabilisation, even though reform efforts are severely hampered by the current political stalemate."
"What are our priorities for the immediate future?"
"Continued support for the implementation of the Arab League Initiative remains our key priority."
"Despite all difficulties, this initiative enjoys broad support and it represents for the moment the only option to find a solution."
"An important date in the process will be 22 April, when the next presidential election session in the Parliament is scheduled."
"The idea of a special Lebanon Summit within the Arab League framework has recently been floated."
"If it materialises, we should see how we can best provide support for this initiative."
"We should note, however, that it is Syria that currently holds the Presidency of the Arab League."
"A clear and continued commitment to the full implementation of the Security Council resolutions relevant to Lebanon also remains essential, indeed crucial."
"The publication of the next implementation reports on UN Security Council Resolutions 1559 and 1701 - in May and July 2007 respectively - will therefore be essential milestones."
"We should also continue efforts to maintain momentum in the Middle East peace process, which has an impact on Lebanon."
"I remain in close contact with my Quartet partners and am looking forward to the Middle East conference planned by the European Parliament later this year."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, as the representatives of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission have told us, and yesterday the High Representative, Mr Solana, when he appeared before the Committee on External Affairs, the recent Arab League Summit in Damascus did not produce any results, to put it diplomatically."
"This is now the 17th time that the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament, Nabih Berri, has postponed the planned vote to elect the President."
"This decision has not been taken because of a lack of consensus on the figure of the candidate for the presidency, who, as everyone knows, is a Maronite Christian, nor because of a lack of consensus on the person - the head of the armed forces, Michel Suleiman."
"This was clear to us as a delegation of MEPs who were in Damascus with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and representatives of Lebanese opposition parties, such as Hezbollah and Amal."
"The problem, Mr President, comes down purely and simply to the distribution of power; it is about establishing blocking minorities in the Lebanese Council of Ministers and about allocating the positions of head of the secret service and head of the armed forces."
"This whole situation, as the Commissioner rightly said, seriously affects the credibility, functioning and international image of the country."
"We therefore want the European Parliament to call for the current opposition forces to find a solution, in order to put the higher interests of the country before these internal issues, so that we can continue working, as we did in the EU electoral observation mission promoted by the Commission, towards a sovereign, democratic, free, viable Lebanon that can be constructed in peace."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is renewed talk of war in Lebanon."
"The political impasse, which has already involved 27 postponements of the convening of Parliament to elect the President of the Republic, could deteriorate, making Lebanon fertile ground once again for inter-Arab conflict and a for now latent source of tension between Iran and Hezbollah and Israel."
"The Arab League Summit in Damascus failed, as has been mentioned."
"However, there is feverish external activity on the part of the Prime Minister, Fouad Siniora, and the Speaker of the Lebanese parliament, Nabih Berri."
"These two strands of diplomacy that I would say are running in parallel, but until now have not been communicating, represent the dialogue of the deaf that has been dragging on for months between the majority and the opposition."
"In my opinion, any attempt to contribute to solving the crisis in Lebanon must necessarily take account of both the internal and the international situation."
"In fact, all the Lebanese forces have strong links outside the country, some of which are tighter than others."
"Against this background it will be important to assess the results of the summit taking place today in Sharm el-Sheikh between Egypt and Saudi Arabia."
"It would be useful if an extraordinary meeting of Arab League Ministers could be called as soon as possible, as requested by Prime Minister Siniora, to try to bring Damascus to a position where it respects Lebanon independence."
"Within this framework, however, I would not leave out an analysis of the truly unique socio-economic situation in that, despite the crisis that followed the war, Lebanon saw its GDP grow by 4% in 2007."
"However, the social situation is very difficult."
"A general strike has been called by the trade unions for 7 May, in a bid to raise minimum wages, and according to UN data, one million Lebanese out of a population of four million are living below the poverty line on less than two dollars a day."
"If we want to help with finding a solution, let us ensure that 22 April is not wasted, not least because 21 August looks like it will be an impossible date to get through."
"This is the date the candidate for the Presidency has given for his resignation as head of the armed forces because he has reached the age limit."
"If a solution has not been found by that date, the crisis will spread to the army, as well as bringing an end to the candidacy of General Suleiman for good."
"I would like to finish with the words of Prime Minister Siniora: 'Lebanon cannot be governed from Damascus, but it cannot be governed against Damascus either.'"
"This seems to me a balanced position, and a benchmark for any initiative by the European Union."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am in almost full agreement with what Mrs Napoletano has just said."
"I say 'almost' because I think that ultimately we need to bear in mind certainly Damascus, certainly other capitals, but in particular the fact that in Lebanon what they are facing, in apparently new forms now, is a policy of systematic assassination of one's opponents."
"The more popular they were, the more likely the former communist leader, and all of them, were to be killed in this series of assassinations."
"We therefore can - and must - certainly pay attention to the diplomatic dimension, but unless we remember that in today's Middle East, as in Europe in 1937, 1938 and 1939, what is being faced is on the one hand an assassination policy and on the other the political reality of victims in the name of freedom, even of enemies, I do not believe we can find the right direction, a direction that can only be given by Europe if it remembers that it was itself delivered from having to renounce national sovereignties, for which reason we have not had wars in Europe in recent years, except in Yugoslavia and elsewhere."
"That was the imperative, and should also be so in the Middle East: to have something based on freedom and human rights as opposed to the ostracism and blackmail of the dictatorships of the 1930s, and those today in the Middle East and Far East."
"Mr President, obviously we have limited influence on the situation in Lebanon."
"It does seem, though, that we have not done all we can to hinder the destabilisation of Lebanon by Hezbollah."
"This organisation is responsible for terrorist attacks in Lebanon, including the January 2008 attacks, which were aimed at areas under the jurisdiction of UNIFIL."
"Hezbollah is a private army which, with support from Iran and Syria, is destroying that once flourishing country."
"For this reason Hezbollah should be added to the European list of terrorist organisations as a matter of urgency."
"This is the only way we can effectively block its activities among the Islamic public in Europe."
"This is the only way we can block off the European part of the money that flows to this organisation."
"It is worth taking this opportunity also to recall the scandalous energy contract signed by Switzerland and Iran."
"Swiss politicians should be left in no doubt that terrorists acting in Lebanon are also benefiting from this money."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"President Pöttering, I would like to put a specific proposal to you, to propose that various Lebanese parliamentary leaders be invited here to the European Parliament in order to discuss the Arab League's proposals and to encourage an exercise in parliamentary diplomacy, so that we do not remain impassive in the face of the situation in which the Lebanese people have become pawns in a geopolitical game that is extremely dangerous, both for them and for peace in the Middle East."
"This proposal could be carried out in the next few weeks as, given the deterioration of the situation in Lebanon, we cannot remain impassive, and Lebanese democracy is one of the weakest links in the Middle East."
"We cannot allow the crisis between Iran and the United States and Iran and Israel to turn Lebanon into a battlefield in which every side loses."
"We need to support the Arab League initiative for a commitment to the election of a new President."
"We cannot let up in our support for the International Court regarding the murder of Rafik Hariri."
"We are quite concerned about the delay in the investigation, which makes it difficult to protect key witnesses in the case, such as the Syrian Mohammed al-Siddiq, who recently disappeared."
"The European Union needs to exert as much pressure as possible so that Syria and Iran cease to hinder the resolution of the political conflict in Lebanon and support the Arab League's proposal on the election of a new President."
"We are also concerned about the constant smuggling of weapons into the country to arm an illegal militia."
"The Lebanese army should have the monopoly on military activity and control its territory."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lebanese people and democratic civil society in that country are the victims of a political crisis decided elsewhere."
"On one side there is the United States, quick to play the Lebanese card against Syria and Hezbollah as part of its pro-Israeli stance to try to stabilise an area devastated by its illegal war against Iraq and to consolidate the military might of the State of Israel."
"It cannot allow itself to lose Lebanon."
"On the other side are Iran and Syria and their allied regimes that are playing out their contest for political, military, nuclear and regional supremacy in Lebanon."
"It does not matter if this means massacre, even the physical massacre, of the Lebanese."
"They do not want to lose Lebanon either."
"The European Union's role is not to align itself with one or the other in this international chess match."
"As Europeans we need to do what we can to try to keep Lebanon politically united, by protecting its sovereignty and encouraging dialogue between the government coalition, Hezbollah and General Aoun, starting with the presidential elections."
"The person elected must be a candidate both parties are happy with. That is Lebanon."
"The secular, multi-faith nature of the country is a valuable asset for the whole of the international community, and particularly for Europe."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, where to start when it comes to breaking the continuing political impasse in Lebanon?"
"The answer is actually too simple for words, and I am convinced that the Council and the Commission are also well aware of this."
"In any case, my clear answer is: start with the disarmament of Hezbollah."
"A highly efficient, heavily armed organisation outside the legal authorities' official means of exercising power is obstructing the normal functioning of the Lebanese state institutions and has so far also blocked a national political compromise."
"Simple answers to international crises are often difficult to put into practice."
"This certainly also applies to the urgent disarmament of Hezbollah; after all, the spectre of renewed civil war is looming."
"On the other hand, Hezbollah's continuing position of military power is guaranteeing the continuing influence in domestic affairs of its two great sponsors, Syria and the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"The consequence of this is obvious: the real threat of a further violent confrontation with neighbouring Israel."
"Besides, the connection with Tehran's present hardline nuclear course is evident."
"Council and Commission, what solution will Europe supply to this Lebanese dilemma?"
"Mr President, I have one further brief question."
"According to reports in today's US press, a Member State, Bulgaria, is channelling profits from the drugs trade to Hezbollah."
"I should like the Council to tell me what the situation is."
"An EU Member State earning money for Hezbollah from the drugs trade - that strikes me as particularly serious."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate gives me great satisfaction."
"Despite all attempts and initiatives on the part of European bodies, I believe we are acting as though we have abandoned to its fate a people ensnared in successive political crises."
"Our treatment of the situation is awkward."
"We seem not to realise that the situation in Lebanon is connected with the challenges in the Middle East and that these challenges are crucial for international security and peace as well as for the EU's strategic plans in the Mediterranean and the Middle East."
"I believe that the European Parliament should be made to understand clearly that we in the EU must adhere to the commitments made in our partnership with Lebanon."
"This obliges us to support the legally elected government, which was formed after the last elections in accordance with constitutional requirements, and which today is the target of attacks and threats."
"We must demonstrate our support through deeds."
"As Mrs Napoletano has also said, we are not giving enough money, because we are keen on an outcome that resolves the crisis and ends insecurity."
"Such an outcome requires institutions to function."
"Parliament has to work as a forum for democratic dialogue and state control; it has to voice the diversity that is an essential part of Lebanon's identity."
"A certain parliament is still closed, not just for the election of the President of the Republic, but for all business."
"If any way is to be found out of the crisis, the President of the Republic needs to be elected immediately and a new government must be formed in accordance with the Constitution."
"Regional forces competing with each other ought not call the tune, as currently seems to be the case in the presidential election."
"We must also demonstrate our support for the Lebanese seeking the truth behind political murders."
"Hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating in the streets, waving 'We Want The Truth' banners."
"We in the EU must act more effectively and strategically in the region."
"We must promote responsibilities and genuine interests."
"We must also find possible resolutions and peace in the states in the area and in the Arab states."
"There must be understanding and national dialogue."
"Let me end on an optimistic note."
"I believe that the political powers have acted responsibly: events could have led to civil war and a coup, but this did not happen."
"Let us therefore make the most of these positive elements."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as chairwoman of the delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, I am pleased we have a debate on Lebanon on the agenda for this afternoon."
"The crisis that this country has been experiencing for several months obviously goes beyond the challenges of a simple presidential election or the formation of a government."
"We know that it is the very foundations of the political system that are in question, based as they are on the subtle balance between the different religious faiths in the Lebanese patchwork."
"What is also in question is the place Lebanon hopes to take in the regional arena."
"Does it want to be an aircraft carrier of the United States and their allies in the region, or the advanced post of a so-called Shi'ite crescent?"
"I do not believe that Lebanon really has to choose between the American camp and the Syrian/Iranian camp."
"The only viable camp for Lebanon is the camp of Lebanon itself."
"It is certainly not for the European Union to interfere in Lebanese internal affairs."
"Europe does not have to support one coalition over another."
"What the European Union can do is offer itself as a mediator, help the Lebanese parties to find a minimum of trust in each other - which is essential before any agreement can be reached - and put forward its good offices to launch a process of understanding and compromise."
"We are right to support the Arab League's plan based on a triple consensus: one president, one government of national union and the reform of the electoral law guaranteeing fair representation of all the components of Lebanese society."
"That is the condition sine qua non for the political secularisation that is provided for in the Taif Agreements and that a growing majority of the Lebanese people want to happen."
"We must support every initiative to achieve this."
"In this regard, the proposal by Nabih Berri, speaker of the Lebanese parliament, which proposes to revive national dialogue, is a positive signal."
"Just as we have done for many years, we must continue to support a Lebanon that wants to be sovereign, united and at peace with itself at last."
"- (ES) Mr President, I have the impression that one of the few times that Lebanese members of parliament elected in 2005 have been able to act freely was recently, at the plenary sitting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in Athens, because being a Lebanese member of parliament is certainly very dangerous, as events have tragically demonstrated."
"I think that there are some who want us to believe that there is no solution for Lebanon, and therefore that Lebanon is not viable as an independent, sovereign and democratic State."
"We need to fight against this by supporting the Lebanese institutions, supporting the Arab League's plan and demanding the removal of any obstacles that are being placed in the way of peace and understanding coming to that country."
"Europe has not washed its hands of Lebanon;"
"I would like to remind everyone here of the European military presence in UNIFIL 2, which is an impressive number, and there have been many casualties and deaths, as the Council has reminded us."
"Our political presence is equal to this military presence."
"We have limitations, but within those limitations on our capacity, we need to ask the powers outside the region and the Lebanese to reach an agreement, as without them it will be impossible for there to be socio-economic development for the good of the people or peace in the Middle East."
"Mr President, the recent Arab summit was more soap than substance."
"It failed to resolve the important questions due to the absence of key players."
"Lebanon's political crisis and ever-worsening security situation means that the EU must improve the political dialogue and assist a return to the rule of law and democracy."
"Despite the EU-Lebanon Action Plan having identified effective implementation of Lebanon's international commitments with respect to human rights and fundamental freedoms as a priority, almost no progress has been made."
"Dysfunctional state institutions and the worsening economy have caused civil disquiet and protests."
"Even the recent teachers' strike is toothless without responsive state institutions."
"The current political situation undermines the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) reform agenda, but the ENP can be a catalyst for political debate by moving it from power-based discussions towards issue-based discussions."
"ENP partnership rewards progress."
"Lebanon is not the best student at learning and cooperating with the ENP, but we cannot allow its adoption as if it were a strategy choice."
"(SK) As a member of the Euromed/Barcelona Process delegation, I monitor the issue of Lebanon and I regret to say that although Lebanon has a majority parliament, a legitimate majority, this majority is being intimidated and the parliament does not meet at all."
"Since the murder of Rafik Hariri, who was well-known and respected, there has not yet been a presidential election and the country as a whole is incapable of finding a political solution to this complicated situation."
"Members of the Lebanese Parliament whom I met recently, both at the latest Euromed meeting in Athens and here in Brussels, told us how terrible conditions for them are."
"The feeling in Lebanon is that in practical terms Syria has political power over the country, specifically over southern Lebanon where Hezbollah puts the area in danger on a daily basis by firing rockets into northern Israel."
"Iran supports the situation and I do not think that this axis is willing to accept democratic changes."
"I would like to appeal to my colleagues and to all those present, in both the Council and this Parliament, to adopt measures to provide immediate assistance to Lebanon."
"Mr President, I am also a member of the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, and, indeed, Lebanon is in a tragic situation."
"But I must say to the Council and the Commission that, listening to you this afternoon, I am less than impressed by the sort of impotence of your presentations."
"You are passing off your responsibilities to an equally impotent Arab League."
"We seem to be making no progress, and I think Europe could play a much more significant part, not only in Lebanon but in the whole Middle East issue."
"It sits on a fence and does not come off that fence."
"Please, Council and Commission, can we take a much stronger line on the whole Middle East issue from a European point of view and not just indulge ourselves in pious platitudes?"
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to concur with those voices that say that Europe should come up with an initiative now, and ahead of the suggestion from Mrs Patrie, Chair of the delegation, that we should proffer an opportunity for the main Lebanese forces to speak in our Parliamentary forum and tell us what is really blocking the summoning of their Parliament and commencement of the process of electing a President."
"I believe that a definite policy on Syria is also required."
"The key to the entire policy on Lebanon lies in Damascus."
"We cannot separate our policy on Syria from our position on Lebanon."
"If there is currently talk about negotiations between Israel and Syria concerning Israel abandoning the Golan Heights, then one condition must surely be met, which is that Lebanon has the right to be a democratic country, and Syria has to accept that."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully to the views of members during the today's debate, and I should first say that there is a considerable consensus, both in the Parliament and in the Council, that it is high time that the stalemate situation in Lebanon is overcome."
"The Council has been making efforts in several ways."
"Some of you, amongst others Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Mrs Napoletano, have emphasised that sending money and financial funds to Lebanon is not enough, and that just electing a president will not be enough either."
"This is true. However, in Lebanon and in connection with Lebanon the European Union is doing much more."
"Here I should like to express gratitude to Carlos Carnero González, who, like myself, in his introductory contribution emphasised the considerable commitment of the European Union in the area of security through its military forces, a commitment which has already cost lives."
"However, that is not nearly enough."
"The Presidency of the European Council agrees that it is necessary for the European Union also to play a political role."
"At this stage we must not forget that the Arab League initiative, which the European Union supports, is on the table and that the ongoing efforts of the Secretary General, Mr Moussa, deserve to be supported; and the European Union does support them and will continue to support them."
"We shall be adapting our actions in connection with Lebanon to suit events as they unfold."
"I have already mentioned that the presidential election alone will not resolve all the difficulties."
"A new government will also need to be formed, an electoral reform will be necessary, and, of course, we shall continue to strive for all of this."
"The fact is that a resolution of the political crisis would also have an effect on the economic situation in the country."
"And in making these efforts, the Council and the European Union remain committed to providing support for Lebanon."
"This is a country with a huge potential; and that is why we wish to help it and are determined to provide all the assistance that is within our scope, so that Lebanon can achieve political stability and full economic prosperity as soon as possible."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the Members for a very important and responsible debate."
"I shall report its contents to my colleague, Benita Ferrero-Waldner."
"It seems to me that we - that is, Parliament, Council and Commission - share the basic view that we will certainly continue to support our long-standing partner, Lebanon, in this very critical phase."
"Given the complexity of the challenges Lebanon currently faces, it is indeed essential that, as European institutions, we coordinate our efforts as much as possible and take full advantage of our capabilities."
"The European Parliament has already made valuable contributions to our cooperation with Lebanon in the past."
"A good example is the European election observation mission at the 2005 parliamentary elections."
"Indeed one of the key tasks ahead is to help Lebanese democracy to become more robust to face challenges like the present crisis."
"Electoral reform is a crucial element in every initiative that is expected to make a lasting impact on Lebanon's political system."
"In this context, the European Parliament, with its particular expertise and know-how, can - and, I trust, will - play a key role."
"It is also true that the conflicts in the region are interlinked, as was underlined by several speakers."
"As you know, Lebanon and Israel have never reached a peace agreement."
"Lebanon hosts 400 000 Palestinian refugees partly because Israel and the Palestinians have not yet reached a peace deal."
"Part of the Hizbollah's raison d'être is the ongoing occupation by Israel of the Shebaa farms."
"Therefore, from the point of view of the European Union, a sustained and lasting solution can only be achieved through a comprehensive approach to the peace process."
"Solving one track of the peace process will help in other areas, but no one track can be secure without progress on others."
"Certainly, reaching an agreement between Israel and Syria could help to diffuse tensions in Lebanon, and therefore we have thrown our full support behind the current political process."
"We are hopeful that progress can be extended to other tracks in due course."
"(FR) The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"Croatia: 2007 progress report - Progress Report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (debate)"
"(FR) The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Hannes Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on Croatia's 2007 progress report, and"
"the report by Erik Meijer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the 2007 progress report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and the other fellow Members in particular, who have helped in producing a good, very balanced report."
"My philosophy on this report is as follows."
"I might perhaps mention a visit I made a few weeks ago to Vukovar - which, as a reminder, is the town where the war was particularly brutal, where hundreds of people were dragged out of the hospital and killed."
"It is a particularly painful wound for the Croatian population."
"I have also seen the memorial there and I have talked to the people."
"The wound goes deep, but no hatred, no rejection of neighbouring Serbia has emerged, but instead an attempt to cooperate anew with the Serbian population there."
"The mayoress has sat down at the table with the Serbian representative and colleagues from other ethnic groups and together they have represented the interests of the people there."
"This shows clearly - perhaps more clearly even than the fact that the country's Deputy Prime Minister comes from Serbia, which is also to be welcomed - how this country has tried passionately to overcome the schisms, conflicts and wars of the past and to create a modern Croatia."
"All these things, of course, do not resolve the problems that Croatia still has to solve."
"They do not resolve the issue of the reform of the judiciary or of the public administration, nor do they resolve the issue of the shipping industry - Croatia still has much to do there."
"Therefore, it is simply not the case that we are ready to conclude the treaties and negotiations - absolutely not."
"We are, however, on the right track, and that is something that is important for Croatia, but also for the entire region, as the region is also being sent a positive, an important signal with Croatia's accession: if you fulfil your duties and responsibilities, if you do your homework, then you can become a Member of the European Union."
"The European Union has to stand by this obligation, and that is something we also make clear in this report."
"In addition to the internal reforms, there are, of course, needs and a few problems, including in relations with the country's neighbours."
"I was sad when it was unilaterally decided to introduce the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone."
"It was not that there were no good, substantial or objective reasons for ecological administration of the fisheries, but it did not make sound sense to take this step unilaterally at the same time as promising Italy and Slovenia that no unilateral steps would be taken before finding a common solution."
"Now, Croatia has taken that not-so-easy step and the fishing zone has been abolished for the Member States of the European Union."
"We in the European Parliament now believe that the preconditions exist to overcome many of the impasses there have been - I do not want to put up for discussion here whether or not these were justified."
"Hence my request to Slovenia - Minister Lenarčič is here as a Council representative rather than as a Slovenian minister; he has to wear two hats - as well as to our Slovenian fellow Members in this House, is to help us overcome the bilateral problems."
"Croatia must, of course, play its own part in this, as we have always said, but if we want to convey the European spirit to the regions or to bilateral relations, we need this help."
"Hence, also, the proposal in the report - I am saying this now very informally - that a third person or a third institution help to solve this problem."
"Whether we call it mediation or arbitration or whatever is not the crucial issue."
"What is crucial is that both countries, Croatia and Slovenia, come together to decide the conditions, and that they accept the judgment to be given by the third institution, by mediation."
"Things will then be on the right track."
"The problems in the border area cannot be insoluble."
"I perfectly appreciate Slovenia's interest in having access to the sea."
"This is a perfectly justified concern."
"I believe that this concern of Slovenia's is perfectly reconcilable with Croatian interests."
"This is not insurmountable if we are not deeply and directly involved."
"In conclusion, I wish to state clearly that I should have liked to have been able to conclude negotiations on the part of Croatia in 2008."
"Unfortunately, this is no longer possible or realistic."
"I would therefore ask my fellow Members to take a realistic date, 2009, as the date for the completion of negotiations, so that the newly elected Parliament will then be able to give its assent and ratification to take effect."
"If we all apply ourselves, Croatia can become a Member of the European Union in 2011."
"This is a fine aim, a good aim."
"Let us give it our support."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, if the seven states of the former Yugoslavia all come to form part of the European Union in future, this will have happened on seven different dates as the result of seven different 'road maps'."
"Accession en bloc, before the federation broke up, would probably have been easier for all concerned."
"Slovenia is now a member, Croatia will follow within the next few years, and the third former Yugoslav republic concerned is Macedonia, which has been awaiting the opening of accession negotiations since back in 2005."
"I hope that my subsequent annual report, at the start of 2009, can be all about normal domestic developments in Macedonia, including care for the environment, independence of the media, improvement of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, modernisation of the railways, equality of the various religious denominations, and freedom of negotiation for the trade unions."
"This will be possible if the two problems leading to discord that are attracting the most attention are solved definitively."
"We have not yet reached that point."
"Relations between the two major language communities have improved greatly since the major conflict of 2001."
"The Ohrid Framework Agreement that followed, and in particular the agreement on qualified parliamentary majorities and administrative decentralisation, has made an important contribution to improving mutual relations - which are not yet free of conflict, however - resulting in a temporary parliamentary boycott and a short-lived governmental crisis."
"It is in everyone's interests that the problems underlying this be solved as quickly as possible."
"In a multiethnic state, the complete equality of status of regional languages, including in administrative communication at national level, is an essential symbol of the complete equality of all inhabitants."
"Macedonia can learn from more than a century of linguistic conflict in another bilingual state, Belgium, that delaying this inevitable outcome just leads to unnecessary tension."
"The desire for everyone to be able to use the Albanian language everywhere must be taken seriously."
"Unfortunately, the issue that, at the preparatory stage, not only the rapporteur but also all the shadow rapporteurs believed had to be resolved quickly, is still receiving the most attention."
"We all refuse to side with either of the conflicting viewpoints of the two neighbouring countries regarding the significance of the name 'Macedonia'."
"To the candidate country, looking back over more than a century, Macedonia has been, successively, the name of a resistance movement against the Ottoman Empire, of a Yugoslavian federal state, and of an independent country."
"To its southern neighbour, Greece, Macedonia is an important part of its own long history and the name of the region around the Greek city of Thessaloniki."
"Greece has invested a large amount of capital in its northern neighbour and is the most emphatic supporter of the country's accession to the European Union."
"It is an important step forward that Greece has abandoned its attempts to replace the name 'Macedonia' for its northern neighbour with 'FYROM', a term completely incomprehensible to everyone, in favour of emphasising that this state does not cover the whole of historical Macedonia, but only the Slav and Albanian northern part."
"I have always opposed the view that a state - particularly one formerly under Communist rule - must become a member of NATO before it can be admitted to the European Union."
"In Macedonia's case, the refusal on 2 April to admit this country to NATO does affect its chances of joining the EU in the near future."
"Each Member State has the opportunity to block any newcomer, even if it would like to admit this newcomer if there were not a difference of opinion on one sensitive detail."
"Therefore, section 37 is central to this debate."
"In this connection, and in agreement with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I tabled a compromise amendment this morning."
"I await the reactions to this before my second turn."
"To begin with, I should like to congratulate Mr Swoboda and Mr Meijer for preparing the two reports on the progress achieved by Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"We are glad that the European Parliament has placed the discussion on the progress achieved by both the candidate states on the agenda of this session."
"This is because the Slovenian Presidency attaches exceptional importance to integrating the states of the Western Balkans into the European Union."
"In this connection, I should like to remind you that at their informal meeting at the end of March the foreign ministers communicated to the region of the Western Balkans a positive message concerning its European prospects."
"At this difficult time for the region, in my opinion, such a message is welcome and appropriate."
"Firstly, as regards Croatia: the accession negotiations with Croatia are proceeding according to plan and at this point I would like to express my agreement with Mr Swoboda's view that, over the last two years, Croatia has made substantial progress in meeting the accession benchmarks."
"Sixteen out of 35 negotiation chapters have been opened so far, and two have already been provisionally closed."
"Two accession conferences with Croatia are scheduled, one in April and another in June; and provided that all the benchmarks are met, several other new chapters will also be opened at the two accession conferences."
"I should like to emphasise that the Slovenian Presidency is committed to continuing the process of expansion of the European Union and achieving further progress in negotiations."
"The dynamics of negotiations depend primarily on the candidate state itself, and on its progress as regards the meeting of the benchmarks."
"These have been determined within the negotiations framework, in the revised accession partnership which the Council of the European Union adopted in February this year, as well as in other legal acts."
"I repeat, Croatia has achieved considerable progress; however, the fact is that a lot of work remains to be done."
"As was stated by Mr Swoboda, in the future much more attention should be paid to further transfers and effective implementation of the acquis communautaire."
"Croatia must continue its efforts to meet the benchmarks and achieve faster progress."
"In particular, I would like to mention the following: the reform of the judiciary and administration, the fight against corruption, economic reforms, minority rights, the refugees' return, and full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia."
"The documents I have mentioned also consider it essential for Croatia to continue making efforts to achieve good relations with neighbouring countries."
"Of course this includes finding solutions for the unresolved issues."
"I should like to move on to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: as Mr Meijer stated in his report, this is the only country with candidate status since 2005 which has not yet commenced the accession negotiations."
"In our opinion, once the benchmarks are met, this situation should be finally resolved this year."
"That is why the message conveyed in the European Commission's latest document was that the autumn report on progress made by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could be positive, provided the key priority tasks are fulfilled."
"And a similar message was also communicated at the foreign ministers' informal meeting in Slovenia at the end of March."
"At the same time, we must not forget that the country has already proved its importance for stability in the region."
"The country's role must be recognised, and it must be encouraged with positive signals to continue its constructive role in the region, and to continue with its reforms."
"One such signal is the dialogue on visa liberalisation."
"We concur with Mr Meijer's opinion that the government in Skopje has been implementing the Ohrid Framework Agreement, especially in the sphere of decentralisation and the level of ethnic minorities' representation in the public administration."
"Our wish is that progress be made as soon as possible in finding solutions for the remaining issues, which are crucial for the Albanian community."
"As the country presiding over the EU Council, Slovenia has been encouraging all the political parties to step up their political dialogue and systematic cooperation, so that the next stage in the process of joining the European Union can be achieved this year."
"In this context, I should like to emphasise how sorry we are that, because of the open issue of the name, the latest negotiations have failed to bring the desired results."
"Also, I regret that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has not been invited to become a NATO member."
"Considering that the country has made considerable efforts to secure this invitation, we hope that it will soon follow in the footsteps of the other two candidates, who have each received such an invitation."
"In its statement, following the NATO summit, the Slovenian Presidency has called for the negotiations on the name issue to be continued, and to be concluded as soon as possible."
"The Slovenian Presidency also called for all the politicians in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to preserve the achieved level of unanimity as regards their country's European and Euro-Atlantic future."
"The Slovenian Presidency has also recommended that the country should take full advantage of the time that is still available before the Commission produces its regular autumn progress report."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome Mr Swoboda's report on Croatia and Mr Meijer's report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"On Croatia, I find that the Swoboda report addresses the main issues where Croatia will face challenges on its path to the European Union, focusing particularly on the political sphere."
"It is a solid report that will reflect realities even better if Amendments 15 and 16 by the rapporteur are adopted, for instance concerning the timetable of the process."
"Croatia's accession negotiations have generally been going well, although they have been affected by the application of the ecological and fisheries protection zone - the famous, or infamous, ZERP issue."
"I welcome the recent decision of the Sabor, the Croatian Parliament, to suspend the application of all aspects of the ZERP for EU vessels, in line with Croatia's earlier commitments."
"I commend Prime Minister Sanader for his leadership and I also thank Commission President Barroso for his personal involvement in settling the issue."
"I visited Zagreb in early March and found that Croatia's European vocation was strong enough to settle this problem if it was hampering the accession negotiations."
"The removal of this obstacle by Croatia should allow chapters that have been blocked to be unblocked as of now and negotiations to resume again at normal pace, allowing for substantial progress in the remaining months of the Slovenian Presidency."
"I do agree with the rapporteur and with Mr Lenarčič that Croatia has much work ahead."
"Concrete progress is needed in judicial, administrative and economic reforms, in the fight against corruption and on refugee return and minority rights."
"Croatia will also need to continue to make progress on various open bilateral issues with its neighbours."
"This year could be a decisive one in the accession negotiations, provided that a number of conditions are met by Croatia."
"The Commission is ready to present in this autumn's enlargement package an indicative timetable, or a conditional road map, for the technical conclusion of the accession negotiations in the course of 2009, preferably even during the mandate of the present Commission."
"To achieve this, Croatia needs to deliver on all opening benchmarks by June."
"There is not much time to waste."
"It will also need to comply with all obligations under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and ensure urgent and significant improvements in the management of the EU's financial assistance."
"The Commission is ready to process negotiating positions in the various chapters once benchmarks are met."
"Essentially, the ball is now in Croatia's court."
"The sooner concrete results are achieved, the sooner Croatia will join the European Union."
"I fully agree with Mr Swoboda that Croatia can become a leading benchmark for the Western Balkan countries showing how they can realise their European perspective."
"Concerning the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I can by and large share the assessment of the Meijer report regarding the reform process."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation with the Commission services on the report."
"Following the granting of candidate status in 2005, there was a slowdown."
"However, the Commission's rather critical progress report of November 2007 has been followed by corrective actions."
"Important reforms have been adopted since then, especially to strengthen the judiciary, reform the police and improve inter-ethnic relations."
"I note the recommendation that the Commission should develop a set of benchmarks for the opening of accession negotiations this year."
"I would like to inform you that we have established eight benchmarks, derived from the key priorities of the new Accession Partnership."
"A recommendation to start accession negotiations will depend upon the progress which the country has made in meeting these benchmarks."
"We shall make our assessment in the coming autumn in the enlargement package, which will most likely be presented in early November."
"Evidently, political stability will be essential for success."
"I met President Crvenkovski and Prime Minister Gruevski in Skopje some weeks ago, in March."
"I called upon all political forces in the country to concentrate their energies on the reform agenda in order to take advantage of the opportunities which this year holds for the country."
"I repeat this call today, as it is no less important now, in the aftermath of the NATO summit in Bucharest."
"The name issue has consumed much political energy lately."
"While I congratulate Croatia and Albania on their success in Euro-Atlantic integration with NATO membership, I can understand the disappointment felt in Bucharest last week by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"I encourage the political leadership to continue on the road towards NATO and EU integration with full determination."
"Let me conclude by noting that we are discussing developments in the two countries at a very appropriate point in time."
"Both countries are in a position to make this year a very special and even decisive one in terms of getting more and more integrated with the European Union."
"Support and encouragement from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be highly important for these countries."
"Therefore, I very much appreciate your invaluable contribution to our European policy of stability and progress in the Western Balkans."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are talking today about the only two clearly European candidate countries we have, namely Croatia and Macedonia."
"We hope to be able to conclude the negotiations with Croatia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest."
"We hope to be able to begin negotiations with Macedonia by the end of this year, or by next year at the latest."
"We want to prevent both countries becoming hostages to bilateral problems, and I appeal in particular to our Greek fellow Members to show movement on this issue, as the erroneous decision taken in Bucharest is already starting to destabilise Macedonia."
"As regards Croatia, the Sanader government has been actively pressing ahead with reforms and negotiations."
"I appeal to the Council and Commission to keep up with the pace of work."
"I appeal to the Commission actively to strengthen its capacities and to process the relevant documents quickly."
"I appeal to the Council to open all the negotiating chapters as quickly as possible."
"When they are closed naturally depends on the negotiations and on Croatia's efforts."
"Croatia has done a massive amount of preliminary political work."
"It has settled and resolved the issue of fishing zones with great courage, it has endorsed arbitration with Slovenia, and it has above all sent a signal of great significance to the entire region by appointing a Serbian Deputy Prime Minister to the Sanader government, and this in the light of the situation Mr Swoboda has rightly described in Vukovar, for example."
"Protection of the rights of minorities that goes way beyond what most Member States guarantee in terms of minority rights is taking place there."
"I should therefore like to say that we should acknowledge Croatia's political achievements and decisively support the country on its way into the European Union."
"We are abiding by the ambitious aim to take a decision in the current period."
"Should this not be possible, it will be the autumn."
"We would support your motion, Mr Swoboda, if it contained 'latest' and 'should', but 'could' is only a status report, and we shall therefore keep up the pressure on the Council and Commission."
"We know that this is ambitious, but Croatia deserves to see justice at long last."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I should like to make a couple of comments on both reports on behalf of my group and myself."
"To begin with, compliments to my colleague Mr Swoboda, who has succeeded this year, too, in presenting us with another balanced report."
"When we talk about Croatia, we are talking about the final steps that the country has to take to enable the conclusion of negotiations."
"Hopefully these final steps will take the form of a final sprint."
"The gaps ascertained by the Commission must be filled."
"We hope that this can be done apace, even though, as is always the case at the end of negotiations, the dossiers concerned are difficult ones, for example the dossier on shipbuilding."
"I would appeal to everyone, including the Government of Croatia, to reach the necessary political consensus within the country, too, so that even the difficult decisions can be taken quickly."
"I also concur with Mr Swoboda's words about the dates by which all of this, particularly the conclusion of negotiations, can take place."
"Regarding FYROM - Macedonia - it is important, as the Commissioner has already said, that the country endeavour to reach the Commission's benchmarks this year, so that a decision can be taken on the start of negotiations."
"I believe this to be fundamental."
"It is true of Macedonia, too, that a consensus must be reached in the country itself;"
"I am very concerned in this regard about recent problems with the Albanian minority and the vote being held in Skopje tomorrow or the day after, which may lead to the fall of the government."
"If this were to happen, the country would be at sea, as there could be no negotiations with Greece over the name or any work on the benchmarks to which the Commissioner referred."
"I think that it is important to appeal to everyone in that country to ensure that the consensus holds and to prevent us being faced with a situation of new elections in the next few weeks; it is important to invest in this consensus."
"Finally, we, too, think it a shame that no consensus could be reached in Bucharest on Macedonia's accession to NATO."
"In our opinion, another attempt must be made, based on mediation by the UN and Mr Nimitz, and I hope that both sides invest in a somewhat more productive atmosphere, so that a solution can be found quickly."
"on behalf of the ALDE group. - (HU) Mr President, Commissioner, earlier this year the accession negotiations with Croatia slowed down and the process seemed to have come to a standstill."
"Let us hope that this is now over, and the negotiations will pick up momentum once more."
"The Croatian Parliament's decision to suspend the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone that had been applied to European Union Member States has certainly helped in this regard."
"In recent years Croatia has achieved a great deal that warrants recognition: there can be no denying that it is a functioning democracy; it has a functioning market economy and is implementing the provisions set out in the Stability and Association Agreement."
"At the same time, however, there are undeniably serious problems that also need to be resolved."
"The first of these I would like to mention is procrastination over the reform of the judicial system - this cannot be delayed any longer."
"I believe it is important to strengthen the fight against corruption, and ensure that it extends not only to more minor cases, but also to the 'big players', as Croatia has not made much progress so far in this regard."
"Improvements need to be made as regards efficient use of Community resources, and major structural reforms must be initiated."
"In this context I would like to highlight the situation and role of the shipbuilding industry, which is in need of restructuring."
"If Croatia manages to do all this, then it really ought to be able to conclude the negotiations in time, within the deadline set in the report, and must be given every possible support to do so."
"Croatia's accession process has a regional significance reaching far beyond the process itself."
"If Croatia's accession is successful, it represents a model and an incentive for the other Western Balkan countries too."
"Prompt and successful conclusion of the negotiations is therefore not only the joint responsibility of Croatia and the European Union, but also in their common interests."
"I hope that Croatia will assume this responsibility."
"Last, I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda on the outstanding job he has done in carrying out his duties as rapporteur. Thank you, Mr President."
"Naturally I too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"This is a very good report."
"It is a very good thing that Croatia and Macedonia may obtain membership of the Union before the 2009 European elections."
"In respect of the latter we must clearly avoid adding political conditions for accession, especially in spheres that, like property rights or indemnity claims, belong to the sphere of bilateral relations."
"The process of enlargement cannot be allowed to be hostage to such tensions."
"There is also a broader context to this process."
"Enlargement of the Union into the Western Balkans is a European contribution to stabilisation of this region - a region in which we failed in the 1990s."
"For this process to be completed, we must also send a positive signal to Belgrade."
"By recognising Kosovo, we have placed the pro-European section of public opinion in Serbia in a very awkward position."
"We are left with little time to go even part of the way towards balancing out that impression."
"A road map for a visa agreement with Serbia is needed."
"We should sign a stabilisation and association agreement as a matter of great urgency."
"Today this agreement has become hostage to the internal policy of two Member States, but the whole Union may have to pay the price of stopping it."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) I am delighted with this very good, balanced report by Mr Swoboda, which is a positive sign for Croatia and for the region as a whole."
"Despite all the tangible efforts, however, we must not forget certain problem areas that still require comprehensive reforms before Croatia is able to join the EU."
"Ultimately, the facts are the only reliable benchmark for a country's readiness for accession."
"Examples are the clarification of unresolved border issues, the fight against corruption, administrative reform and respect for human rights."
"Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia is another benchmark for the country's readiness."
"The political parties, civil society and the media must make longer-term efforts to gain the support of the population."
"The same applies to the integration of national and sexual minorities into social and political life."
"I very much welcome the decision to appoint a representative of the Serb minority as Deputy Prime Minister."
"A great deal still has to be done in the environmental protection sector, however, in order to ensure ecologically sustainable development in line with EU targets."
"Supporting Croatia in this is a task I shall be glad to promote."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, we, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, will not vote for the enlargement of the EU to take in FYROM and Croatia."
"We oppose the strengthening of a capitalist and war mongering EU."
"Following the dismemberment of Yugoslavia by ΝΑΤΟ and the EU, imperialist plans are being hatched to shift borders in the Balkans and create protectorates buttressing imperialists and dividing peoples."
"The largest US base in Europe is being formed and expanded on arbitrarily marked-out territories between FYROM and the Serbian province of Kosovo, where EU forces are expected to arrive."
"This typifies the intensification of rivalries in the region."
"At the recent NATO summit, Albania and Croatia were allowed to join, but FYROM was not invited to do so."
"This demonstrates the unpleasant blackmail being applied to the Balkan states, as well as Greece, to subjugate them to imperialist interests."
"With regard to the name, we support a geographically defined solution acceptable to all and far removed from divisive nationalism and enslavement, for peace, stable borders and the protection of the sovereignty of states."
"What we need is a common struggle by the people against the imperialist organisations that divide and exploit it."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (EL) Mr President, the reverberations from the NATO summit in Bucharest have reached this Parliament."
"It is comforting that Europe has at last taken a position on an issue concerning it, as there is usually little enthusiasm to take a position when others are making decisions."
"I therefore, think that all parties have learnt a useful lesson especially the FYROM."
"This new republic has not yet learnt European diplomatic practice, having placed its hopes on accession to ΝΑΤΟ simply because of US promises and infantile, misguided hopes of liberation from bondage."
"In negotiations between European states provocation and fanaticism should never be an option."
"Choices should not be made on the imaginary basis of ancestry, neighbouring cultures and history; instead, we should act in a spirit of consensus, comprehension and, above all, probity in order to find a solution rather than worsen problems."
"A positive approach will benefit FYROM, which we hope will be helped to join both ΝΑΤΟ and the EU."
"If FYROM refuses to accept the name chosen for it and persists in this refusal, it will find that there are obstacles to its accession, because it has undermined its own efforts."
"If its efforts are undermined now, perhaps its future will also be undermined."
"(SV) Thank you, Mr President."
"The report is good throughout."
"It is well balanced and gives an objective description of developments in Macedonia; commending what has been achieved and appealing for a little more time to be devoted to what remains to be done."
"But, as so often before, the debate is reduced to discussing our various views of the dispute over the country's name rather than working out how we can get Macedonia into the EU as soon as possible."
"We all know what happened at the summit in Bucharest."
"I will not go into who was right or wrong or who had greater national interests to defend, but I have to say that foreign policy is not just a matter of who is right and who is wrong."
"Foreign policy is about getting solutions which best serve peace and security in one's own country or region and, in our case, Europe."
"This is achieved by a mixture of goodwill, compromise, good diplomacy and clear leadership."
"To prevent a country in southern Europe from becoming a member of NATO when the possibility arose is, to my mind, not a particularly wise move, given the complexity of the situation in the Balkans right now and all the challenges we face: independence in Kosovo, which is a fait accompli, the departure of the government and new elections in Serbia and still-ongoing police reforms in Bosnia."
"But to block the EU membership of a Balkan country, or even just to think of doing so, is not just unwise but downright dangerous!"
"Only three hours ago I spoke with a colleague here in the European Parliament who said: 'If they don't do as we want, we can block them, not just in NATO, but in the EU."
"The law entitles us to do so'."
"My reaction is to say: then we must change the law!"
"Surely laws are not there for us to block, disrupt or blackmail one another?"
"Surely they are there so that we can all get along together as best we can in a peaceful and secure Europe?"
"It is my firm opinion that, the sooner all the Balkan countries are in the EU, the sooner we shall have a secure Europe."
"There is absolutely no doubt that Macedonia belongs to Europe and that Macedonia should be brought into the EU as quickly as possible."
"I urge you to support the report."
"(SL) In respect of the report on Croatia: both this House and the European Commission have almost enthusiastically received the news that the Croatian Parliament has suspended its decision to declare an Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone."
"And it seems that owing to this decision Croatia may be rewarded with fast-track negotiations."
"Although my wish is that Croatia should, in any event, join the European Union as soon as possible, I would like to warn this House, and especially the rapporteur, my friend Hannes Swoboda, that the unilateral actions of the Republic of Croatia in respect of its borders with neighbouring countries are not an exception but a rule."
"What is exceptional in this matter is only that, for once, Croatia has had to withdraw its unilateral action due to being faced with a choice: either the European Union, or a nationalistic isolation."
"And it is here that this pressure has proven to be useful, and I hope that Mr Swoboda and also the European Commission and the Presidency will continue to insist on the policy that unilateral actions of the Republic of Croatia regarding the determination of frontiers with neighbouring countries shall not be rewarded."
"(SL) The best way of stabilising this part of the Balkans is for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to make progress and move closer to the European Union."
"Its successful negotiations will help all other neighbouring countries to make additional efforts to gain candidate status."
"In order to overcome the dispute over the name, external initiatives are required."
"Symbolic gestures are necessary both in Skopje and Athens, as well as perseverance."
"Now is the right time to look for a less provocative name for Skopje Airport, and to condemn the disrespectful treatment of the Greek flag."
"However, any further difficulties and the discrimination which holders of Macedonian passports are subjected to in connection with Greek visas are also unacceptable."
"In the European Union, we are building a community of modern post-national states."
"Mutual respect of differences and national identities is also an issue of respect for fundamental human rights."
"Only in this way can we prevent, or at least limit any negative consequences of the feeling that one's nationality is threatened."
"We need to abolish the visa regime for all the countries in this region."
"However, also required is a rapid and permanent solution for the country's name and a comprehensive alliance between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece."
"Peace and stability, and fast and successful Euro-Atlantic integrations are in the interest of both the states and all the nations."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, and Mr Lenarčič, the Slovenian Presidency ought to table the Macedonian question for the next summit."
"There is no need whatsoever to wait until autumn."
"And one more thing about Croatia: by implementing the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, Croatian politics was hoisted by its own petard."
"In the future such surprises will not be possible."
"If this adventure has taught us something so be it, but if they have not learnt anything, then all the words and vows about finalising negotiations in 2009 is just dust in the eyes."
"No one needs dust in their eyes: not the citizens, nor the economy, nor the neighbouring countries, nor the European Union."
"What we now need is a success story."
"However, for any success the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept) is a necessity."
"(PL) Mr President, in making a constructive assessment of Croatia's progress, the European Union should not only set conditions, but also offer all possible assistance, bearing in mind the experience of other European states, the specifics of the region and the fresh memories of war that remain with the people of this country."
"Integration of the Balkan Peninsula without Croatia is not feasible."
"It should also be stressed that the last two years of cooperation have brought unexpectedly good results, and this undoubtedly bodes well for the process of integration with the European Union."
"Obviously there are certain areas where more resolute action is needed."
"In my view, however, the efforts made by this state should be given their due, and the whole of the EU should support such action."
"Over the last two years Croatia has made laudable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law."
"I would consequently express the conviction and the hope that with mutual engagement and suitable support from other Member States, negotiations will be successfully completed in time for the accession treaty to be finalised before the European Parliament elections in June 2009."
"(DE) Mr President, a warm welcome to our counterparts from Macedonia who are following this debate."
"Commissioner Rehn has said that we are encouraging Macedonia to move forward in the reform process."
"'Yes,' we all say in unison, 'we want negotiations to be opened this year.'"
"However, we still need to name names."
"The party who has put paid to Macedonia's ability to enter into alliance commitments is Greece, with its veto against the country's membership of NATO."
"There is admittedly a naming dispute, but we cannot ignore the fact that, in 1995, Greece made a binding statement, valid under international law, agreeing that the naming dispute would never be an obstacle to Macedonia joining the international community, the EU or NATO."
"Greece has broken this internationally binding agreement, and if we want to impose reforms in this regard, I say that Greece is in breach of European criteria and not Macedonia."
"This is a step backwards, it is a slap in the face of a small state that is really making every effort to go along with us and open negotiations."
"I would also say, therefore, Mr Swoboda, that the sleight of hand to stop, or postpone, tomorrow's vote again further risks destabilising the government in Macedonia, encouraging as it does the nationalistic forces."
"The actual problem is that with Greece we have an allied country that refuses point blank to recognise any kind of minority in its own country."
"This is contrary to the Copenhagen criteria, which is embarrassing to the European Union and to the alliance."
"I wish Macedonia every strength as it takes the next few steps in spite of Greece."
"(DE) Mr President, not only is Croatia culturally and historically anchored in Central Europe, but also it already meets all the accession criteria."
"Therefore, we should not be putting any unnecessary obstacles in its way."
"With the settlement of the fisheries dispute, Croatia has once more affirmed its readiness for EU membership, and the Croatian Government is also strengthening its efforts to combat corruption."
"Nevertheless, Croatia's rapid admission, which has now come within its grasp, should not in my view lead to automatic entry for any other states."
"As is generally known, Macedonia is having to battle with not only corruption, but also economic problems and the rule of law."
"Particularly with regard to Kosovo's declaration of independence, it remains to be seen whether the ethnic peace with the Albanian minority can continue in the long term."
"We must not repeat the mistakes of past enlargement rounds."
"The EU must in my view finally wake up to the fact that unresolved conflicts, cultural differences and socioeconomic problems do not vanish into thin air with accession."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"As chairman of the Croatia-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee, I feel that recent months have brought a favourable turn of events in Croatia's Euro-Atlantic integration process."
"A few weeks ago, Mr Barroso outlined the road map for concluding accession negotiations by autumn 2009, and last week Croatia received an invitation to join NATO."
"Both of these developments are an acknowledgement that Croatia is on the right track, and the international community is rewarding the efforts of the Croatian government."
"It is no coincidence that the Eurobarometer result in Croatia has risen above 60% again for the first time in a long time."
"I also think it was a remarkable and wise attitude that led to our Croatian friends' decision not to enforce the fishing protection zone in the case of European Union Member States in the interests of Croatia's membership of the European Union."
"On the issue of Kosovo's independence, the government of Mr Sanader has likewise pursued a moderate course by aligning itself with the majority of EU Member States and recognising Kosovo's independence."
"Mr President, the fact that the Croatian Serb minority has been given the post of deputy prime minister in the current cabinet has contributed greatly - as others have already said - to stability in the region and peace among the different ethnic groups."
"I believe it is unfair on the part of the Slovenian Prime Minister to announce that he would not rule out vetoing Croatia's accession to the EU because of the border issue between the two countries."
"EU enlargement and the fate of a nation must not be tied to resolving a bilateral dispute over borders."
"The report carries a positive message in that it recognises the progress made by Croatia as regards stability in the Western Balkan region, as regards ensuring the country's economy is ready to compete in the European Union context, and as regards institutional reforms and adoption of European Union legislation."
"Alongside the positive points, however, the report does not shrink from mentioning the challenges that face us: reforming the judicial system, combating organised crime and corruption, bringing refugee returns to a conclusion, and resolving or alleviating bilateral tensions."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda and Erik Meijer on their 2007 progress reports on Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively."
"Both reports are excellent."
"As a Socialist Group shadow for the report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I would like to thank Mr Meijer for his serious and honest cooperation during the making of this report."
"The report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia hails the achievements in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which deals with the political aspect of inter-ethnic relations."
"The report comments on economic performance, the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors, and progress in the fight against corruption."
"On the negative side, we regret the signing of the Bilateral Immunity Agreement by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the United States, which grants exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in contradiction of EU standards and policies."
"The report calls on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece to increase efforts to overcome the dispute on the name of the country."
"That should in no circumstances become an obstacle to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's membership of international organisations."
"On the name issue, the report does not criticise either of the two sides."
"It only encourages both sides to carry on negotiations, despite what happened at the NATO Summit in Bucharest last week."
"Fortunately Javier Solana said yesterday in the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee that negotiations on the name will continue."
"If the two sides agree, NATO can take a decision to invite the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia immediately, even at ambassador level, so a new summit will be needed."
"The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could get a date for the start of accession negotiations this year."
"The European Parliament should give a clear lead for the country towards European integration."
"(DA) Mr President, when we talk about the Balkans, we have to look at the region as a unified whole."
"The EU's long-term objective is the accession of all Balkan countries."
"For this objective to be achieved, results are also expected on the part of the countries themselves."
"A common European future is the joint task of the Member States and all the Balkan countries."
"We Nordic countries are no stranger to historical conflicts, but are now working together."
"The Balkans, like the Nordic region, are bound together by a common history, common languages and a common culture throughout their length and breadth."
"It should be possible, therefore, to launch a process of cooperation to ensure peace and stability."
"At present, there are a number of cooperation agreements between countries in the region."
"Why not go one step further?"
"Taking inspiration from Nordic cooperation, the Balkan countries could establish a cooperation forum along the lines of the Nordic Council or the Baltic Council."
"Intensifying the existing regional political cooperation in the form of a Balkan Council will enable these countries to enter into practical, forward-looking cooperation, which will offer an opportunity to stabilise the region and make those countries that are not yet Member States or official candidate countries more prepared for accession."
"(PL) Mr President, Croatia, that old European nation with a long history and an interesting culture, should be brought into the European family of nations known as the European Union as soon as possible."
"Croatia, a country applying to join the Union, paradoxically has a longer history than some of the founding states of the European Community, such as Belgium and Luxembourg."
"Zagreb and Split are very European places, while Dubrovnik is a jewel in Europe's cultural crown."
"During this debate, most of the speakers, including myself, have spoken wearing ties."
"It is worth remembering that ties were invented by the Croats and it should also be emphasised here in the European Parliament, which so values liberty and freedom, that the Croatian port of Dubrovnik was the first in Europe to prohibit trading in slaves at the beginning of the 15th century."
"Given this situation, we do not even have a moral right to hold back Croatia's access to the Union."
"(FR) The fact that I am acting as President but not wearing a tie quite clearly has nothing to do with the item on the agenda."
"(EL) Mr President, the Meijer report and the unanimous resolutions of the EU-Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee both emphasise the three vital steps FYROM has taken towards Europe."
"The first step, of course involves meeting accession requirements and complying with the acquis communautaire."
"Although FYROM has made progress, it must continue its journey of reform as stressed both in the Meijer report and in various other reports by the European Commission."
"The second step concerns internal policies and social cohesion."
"It must continue to abide by the Ohrid Agreement, especially as far as the Albanians and also other minorities in this multi-ethnic country are concerned."
"The third step is resolving the differences between FYROM and its neighbours in accordance with the Salzburg Declaration."
"Let me stress here that Greece was - and continues to be - at the forefront of endeavours to achieve the accession of all the Balkan states to Euro-Atlantic structures, since it firmly believes that the development of the countries in the region will benefit all."
"For Greece, however, the name issue is not simply a historical, psychological or emotional problem."
"It is a genuine political issue for all Greek citizens, as it concerns the European values of good neighbourliness and regional cooperation."
"May I remind you that Greece agreed to FYROM being awarded the status of accession candidate subject, of course, to the proviso in COM(2007)663 that a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue be found through negotiations."
"Finally, I should point out that even after the postponement in Bucharest of an invitation to FYROM to join NATO pending the resolution of the name issue, Greece is in favour of continued negotiations."
"In fact, it has taken the generous compromise step of suggesting an acceptable composite name, so all that remains for the other side to do is to meet Greece halfway."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to believe that compromises will be reached regarding the few points still to be clarified, enabling us to go ahead with the vote in Strasbourg."
"Madam President, Croatia has a European vocation: the recent invitation to join NATO and the current negotiations to join the EU are a testimony to that."
"This is quite an achievement for a country which only a decade ago was practically at war."
"Equally, however, that is not enough to eliminate the challenges still facing both Croatia and the EU on the way to completing those negotiations."
"The timetable is extremely tight; practically each day counts, irrespective of the different dates advanced for the finalisation of the process."
"However, when I visited Zagreb some time ago at the head of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I took note of the determination of the Croatian authorities to do away with those problems and achieve membership of the Union."
"In this respect, the recent decision of the Croatian Parliament to exempt the EU states from the application of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (ZERP) following Commissioner Rehn's visit, is both a testimony to that determination and is an important step in the right direction."
"I am convinced that, with the right administrative capacity to implement the required legislation, Croatia, in both the EU and NATO, will be a solid factor of stability and progress in an area that still needs our full attention."
"I congratulate Mr Swoboda on all his work reflected in this report."
"(SV) Thank you, Madam President."
"Croatia plays a key role in the democratic development of the Western Balkans, and it is immensely important that the process should continue."
"We saw that, for understandable reasons, it slowed down somewhat during the Croatian election campaign and the formation of a new government, but now I really hope that the process will put on some speed."
"As previous speakers have noted, the timetable is extremely tight."
"I welcome the temporary lifting of the restrictions in the Ecological Zone in the Adriatic."
"It is a positive signal for relations between Slovenia, Italy and Croatia, but environmental considerations must continue to weigh heavily in our treatment of this unique marine environment."
"Croatia still has a great deal to do as regards the reform of the legal system and the judicial process."
"Far too many people still have to wait far too long for a verdict on their cases."
"This must be prioritised, and the country's administrative capacity must be developed and expanded."
"Finally, I welcome the work done by the EU Committee of the Croatian Parliament, which is headed by my good friend Vesna Pusić."
"We now hope that the negotiations will be excellent and that they can be concluded rapidly."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Swoboda's report is encouraging, realistic and balanced."
"I congratulate him on it."
"It shows the progress Croatia has made, such as its exemplary legislation on minorities, its constructive cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, its increased commitment to fighting corruption, and above all the agreement of Parliament and government regarding the fishing zone, which has been particularly difficult to achieve."
"Croatia and the European Commission now have to bring all their resources to bear to negotiate the forthcoming chapters quickly and satisfactorily."
"An international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia."
"Croatia has a key role to play in the region and should be admitted to the European Union soon."
"Bilateral issues must not be an obstacle."
"With regard to Macedonia, I can tell you that I was at a conference there at the weekend and the mood is really very agitated following the rejection by NATO."
"People feel they have been unfairly treated."
"Mr Meijer's report shows the stony path the country has already successfully trodden."
"There is certainly a great deal still to do, but when the naming issue continually hangs over everything like the Sword of Damocles it is difficult to move on in other areas of policy."
"I have been monitoring the situation there since 1992 and would like Macedonia and Greece to find a solution at long last to the dispute regarding the name, particularly for the young generation."
"Both sides have made concessions in recent weeks and both must take another step closer to each other."
"I would find it incompatible with our European values and actually irresponsible if a veto were once again to provide the opportunity to bar the country from joining the European Union."
"This must not happen!"
"Madam President, I am very disappointed at the current relations between the West and Macedonia."
"Frankly speaking, the people of Macedonia deserve far better treatment from us."
"With the independence of Kosovo and the recent failure of NATO accession, the situation is even more complicated."
"In Macedonia there are separatist elements on one side and nationalists on the other who try to challenge the stability of the country, and the Bucharest decision does not help the situation at all."
"But perhaps our Macedonian friends can learn at least one lesson from Bucharest."
"It is not enough to get the support of the US."
"Many decisions depend on the common accord of the Member States, not only in the European Union but also in NATO, and any Member State may use its veto."
"In the light of the latest events Macedonia should reconsider its standpoint on exempting the US from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court."
"Many mistakes were committed on both sides - by us and the Macedonian politicians - but we cannot punish ordinary people for our mistakes."
"That is why at least in the field of visa liberalisation we should act quickly, assisting the Macedonian people to travel, learn and have closer contacts with everyday European life."
"Three and a half years ago when I was elected Vice-Chairman of the EU-Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee, I had many optimistic plans on how to improve our relationships."
"Very few of these ideas were realised."
"I hope at least in the field of visa liberalisation we can make a step forward."
"(EL) Madam President, Greece has consistently supported the European prospects of FYROM, to whose economic development has it contributed."
"We have worked systematically to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name problem under the auspices of the UN."
"Greece has made significant steps and now supports a composite name with a universally binding erga omnes geographical indication."
"Unfortunately, the other side has not been so willing."
"Following the outcome of the NATO summit in Bucharest, it is in the interests of all sides that talks should continue and agreement be reached as swiftly as possible."
"NATO's decision not to issue an invitation does not mean the rejection of membership but points to the need for a resolution."
"I believe that the original text of my fellow Member Mr Meijer's report was balanced on this issue."
"Unfortunately, owing to the amendments adopted, the report on the name issue has been overthrown."
"We call upon the Members of the European Parliament not to accept formulations that interfere with the continuing negotiation process, which is entering its most crucial phase."
"(SK) Without the accession of the countries of south-eastern Europe to the EU we cannot talk about the success of European integration."
"During the Cold War, the former Yugoslavia was the bastion of freedom and many emigrants, including those who had lived in the former totalitarian Czechoslovakia, fled to the West precisely through the country that was a warning to the former Soviet Union and its satellite countries."
"In reply to a question I asked the Council regarding border disputes between Slovenia and Croatia, the Council informed me that it had adopted a revised accession partnership with Croatia, the implementation of which is the main precondition for progress in the negotiation process."
"I welcome the report by the rapporteur, Mr Hannes Swoboda."
"It makes me optimistic."
"Like the rapporteur, I am also convinced that if it continues with the progress it has already made in the integration process, Croatia will satisfy all the conditions for accession to the European Union and will become an important catalyst for all the other countries in the Western Balkans."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate my colleague Mr Swoboda for the work he has done and the quality of his just and balanced report highlighting the progress made particularly with the Constitutional Law on National Minorities, and the work still to be done such as the necessary strengthening of the judicial system."
"We are delighted that the Croatian Republic has abandoned the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone in the Adriatic, which was a source of tensions within the European Union."
"This is a highly symbolic act, if there can be such a thing, demonstrating how keen Croatia is to join the European Union."
"'There is no love, there is only proof of love,' Jean Cocteau told us."
"With this act, Croatia has applied this maxim to our own situation."
"We in turn must stay on target for the signature of the accession treaty in June 2009, a symbolic date and an ambitious goal."
"There is no politics without symbolism."
"Let us affirm this, let us send out this strong message, and show the Croatian people, show Croatia how much we are looking forward to welcoming them into the European family because it is not just for Croatia, it is a strong symbol for the stability of the Balkans and for peace."
"Let us therefore work twice as hard to achieve this objective."
"Let us help the Commission and Croatia along this path."
"(PL) Madam President, I asked to be allowed to speak on the subject of Croatia and Macedonia in order to emphasise the complexity of the situation in the Balkans and the need to conduct a calm and balanced policy."
"The drama of Serbia and Kosovo should caution us against taking hasty decisions."
"The same kind of drama could also arise in Macedonia, which is home to many Albanians."
"This hazard has been averted thanks to the wisdom of the leaders of the interested parties."
"This positive experience must be acted on and supported, without stirring up others - against their will, by force, without explaining why actions are taken."
"(EL) Madam President, first of all, let me say that I totally agree with Mr Swoboda's views about Croatia's accession prospects."
"Secondly, in connection with Mr Meijer's report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I thank the rapporteur for his willingness to engage in talks."
"However, I call upon the government and political forces of FYROM to look to the future and make the necessary effort to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue."
"Such progress will mean meeting the criterion of good neighbourly relations and will open the way for further progress by FYROM towards the EU."
"Finally, let me endorse Mr Swoboda's proposal to postpone the vote on the Meijer report for approximately one week in order to give us the time to examine more closely the compromise amendments that have been tabled."
"(SK) I will be very brief."
"The report by my colleague Mr Swoboda quite unambiguously identifies all the issues that needed to be identified and, in my opinion, the report also clearly reflects Mr Swoboda's political experience and professionalism."
"I would just like to say as a vice-chairwoman of a regional parliament that the individual Croatian regions are well prepared to become an asset to the European Union."
"This issue is being discussed by the existing Member States not only at national level with the Croatian Government but also with the Croatian regions."
"In my view, this augurs well for active participation by the Croatian regions in the EU's future policies."
"(CS) Not so long ago we were reassured by Mr Rupel that the Slovenian Presidency was acting properly in relation to Kosovo."
"What we had expected came to pass: the crisis has expanded."
"In Macedonia Mr Thaçi recently caused a collapse of the coalition government and demanded federalisation, bilingualism and recognition of the Skanderbeg flag."
"Albanian separatists behave in a similar way in the Preševo Valley in the south of Serbia, where they threaten to boycott elections."
"This crisis can be expected to reach Montenegro."
"In my opinion, we need to help Macedonia, to offer it all the help it needs to be a stable country, but we must refuse to give any help to Albanian separatists because we can see clearly that the 10-year attempt to transform terrorists into democrats has failed completely."
"Madam President, Greece, a long-standing Member of the EU, and its 11 million citizens, do consider that they have a serious and legitimate problem with the name of their neighbour, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and we have to respect that concern."
"It is very disappointing that, despite the fact that Greece is holding negotiations at this very moment with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia about this issue, some fellow MEPs and some governments of the EU have already taken sides and are also trying to push the European Parliament into taking sides: the side, of course, of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"This is not very wise, it is not fair and it is not helping either the cohesion policy of the EU or the situation, because it will not only make the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia more intransigent in its claims about the name in the negotiations and it will also mean that there will not be a proper solution for a long time to come."
"(SL) I too am glad that our neighbouring country Croatia has suspended the implementation of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone, which has been the main obstacle to the negotiations being able to continue."
"In spite of this, Croatia should be seriously warned that in the European Union, we respect agreements, and do not resort to unilateral actions."
"However, I do not agree with excessive lauding of Croatia because it has suspended the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone."
"Croatia concocted this problem in the first place, and now we excessively laud it because it has suspended it."
"This can only encourage it to try and resort to resolving other issues in a similar fashion."
"In Croatia they believe they can get away with a lot, because they are aware they enjoy considerable support to join the European Union."
"Slovenia has always supported Croatia's joining the European Union; however, we cannot agree with their actions concerning unresolved issues with borders, whilst they are selling land which belongs to Slovenia."
"Madam President, I think this report is too optimistic by half."
"Last year, I spent a very intensive week in Croatia in meetings with diplomats, academics, lawyers, businessmen, chambers of commerce and the media."
"I got a very clear picture of a country that does not have a proper market economy and a country that has far too much government engagement in the judiciary, in the media and in business."
"It is what we describe as crony capitalism."
"The Government expends more than 50% of Croatia's GDP."
"It is simply not a free market in the sense we understand."
"They need to implement transparency in government contracts, which are subject to graft."
"They need to implement full disclosure of interest in planning decisions, which, at the moment, just provide income for officials."
"We have a short window of opportunity to urge reform on Croatia before accession."
"I am not convinced that we are using it adequately."
"It is very significant that the debate on this issue should have aroused so much interest, but unfortunately only five minutes were scheduled, and they have already passed."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I fully respect your ruling that this debate is subject to a time schedule, but perhaps the interest shown by Members under the catch-the-eye procedure might encourage you and, indeed, your colleagues to consider extending the time available for Members to discuss matters that are of general European concern and not simply to those who serve on a particular committee."
"There are many things I would like to say about Macedonia and Croatia, but I am not permitted to do so."
"I shall commit them to my memoirs and I shall send you a personal copy."
"Because of the great interest shown in this issue, we doubled the speaking time."
"Normally it is five minutes, but on this occasion 10 minutes were given."
"Your comment, however, is really very interesting."
"When we re-examine our working methods, we can make provision for other, similar facilities with regard to interventions by Members."
"First of all, I should like, in the name of the Council, to express my agreement with the statement made by Commissioner Rehn, that this is a crucial year for Croatia on its path to European Union membership."
"Once again I should like to thank the rapporteur, Hannes Swoboda, for the report he prepared, providing a very clear picture of the current situation, the level of development reached, and the future challenges."
"We hope that Croatia will seize the opportunity and make fast progress."
"The fact is that its progress will primarily depend on Croatia itself, and on the pace and the quality of reforms they must complete."
"I should like to point out, Mr Schmidt, that the Slovenian Presidency will conduct this agenda with the utmost responsibility."
"The Slovenian Presidency supports Croatia's progress primarily because its fastest possible progress towards the European Union membership is important for Croatia, but also because it is important for the European Union, and because it is important for the region as a whole."
"However, the responsible conduct of this agenda is to be based on the negotiations framework, which has been agreed with Croatia, based on the revised accession partnership recently adopted by the EU Council, and on other legal acts of the European Union."
"And it is on this basis that we hope that Croatia will progress as quickly as possible, and the Slovenian Presidency will work towards this end."
"As regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: Mr Wiersma, Mrs Berès and others have mentioned the danger of political instability in this country."
"The Slovenian Presidency has sincere hopes that this will not happen."
"Any political crisis, or possibly early parliamentary elections would slow down the necessary process of reforms for a couple of months."
"We would like to see the unity of the citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia preserved and strengthened, irrespective of their political and ethnic allegiances, their unity of views on their joint future in the European Union and the Euro-Atlantic structures."
"Also important is that, with the Albanian party DPA rejoining the government coalition, the internal political situation has been consolidated."
"Now is the time, but the time is limited."
"We have time only until the next European Commission autumn report, their regular report on the progress that has been achieved."
"It is important that work completed during this period, which at the end of the year gained additional acceleration, is continued, especially as the political dialogue has been rekindled, and as concrete results have been achieved in the sphere of reforms."
"A National Council for EU Integration has been established, and an ambitious plan for the fulfilment of the Accession Partnership tasks was adopted."
"This course should be continued."
"The Slovenian Presidency will continue to provide the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with decisive support on this path."
"I would like to conclude with the following thought: the issue of Western Balkans stability and the region's faster integration into the European framework must remain one of the Union's top priorities."
"The Slovenian Presidency has set out this issue as one of its priority tasks."
"We hope this will continue to be so in the future as well."
"The fact is that any investment in the future of the Western Balkans in Europe is also an investment in the future of the European Union."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the Member States and the Members of the European Parliament for their very extensive support for the European prospects for the Western Balkans, as well as for your contributions to today's debate."
"Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first, let me thank Members for a very substantive debate, which, in my view, underlines the importance of the European perspective for the Western Balkans."
"A number of important issues were raised and I can only comment on some of them in this short response."
"I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the Slovenian Presidency for making the Western Balkans a key priority of its term of office."
"I found the Foreign Ministers' informal meeting in Brdo, Slovenia, some weeks ago, to be very important, and it certainly gave a new stimulus and dynamism to our policy in the Western Balkans, like this debate."
"In my view, we are now on the right track."
"The region has made steady progress over the past couple of years and once the major risks of instability, like the aftermath of the Kosovo status process or the fragility of democracy in Serbia, can be handled well, then I am sure that the region will have a very bright future and that this future is, indeed, in the European Union."
"The Presidency has already responded to the points made as regards the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"I can only second those views and say that the country is well placed to take an historic step forward this year if it acts with determination and sustained efforts to meet the benchmarks."
"It is encouraging that the Macedonian Government has established an action plan to meet benchmarks and a new national plan for the adoption of the acquis."
"Now I want to encourage the country to implement its own plans and thus pave the way for a positive recommendation from the Commission in the coming autumn."
"Several of you referred to visa liberalisation."
"I can inform you that the Commission is currently working on a road map for visa liberalisation for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"We will present a draft to the country shortly and, as the country is quite advanced in many respects, for instance on biometric passports, I hope that it will be able to meet the conditions of the road map rather swiftly and thus achieve the goal of visa-free travel for citizens of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia§."
"I would also like to inform you that we shall shortly - before the end of April - present a road map of this kind for visa-free travel for Serbia where, likewise, ordinary citizens value this extremely highly."
"We want to facilitate, on our part, this important objective."
"On Croatia, I can conclude that a clear majority of the European Parliament has a realistic view of what needs to be done by Croatia for the country to be able to succeed in concluding accession negotiations in the course of 2009."
"This is good, because the real friends of Croatia should not sweep the problems under the carpet but be honest about what needs to be done and encourage Croatia to implement the necessary reforms on the ground and without delay."
"Sustained efforts are needed."
"Mr Posselt asked the Commission to step up its efforts and I can assure him that the Commission will have no problems whatsoever in processing negotiating positions in the various chapters once the benchmarks are met by Croatia itself."
"Ms Ek referred to the environmental aspects of overfishing in the Adriatic and I would like to respond to her and inform you all that Prime Minister Sanader told President Barroso and myself of his concern for a special area in the middle of the Adriatic, the 'Jabuka Pomo Pit', which is an important spawning ground."
"The Commission is strongly in favour of the sustainable management of fish stocks and Commissioner Borg has been very active in this matter."
"The Commission is ready to work on a proposal to establish a fisheries protection area in the Adriatic, as foreseen under the new Mediterranean Regulation."
"This will need further discussions with Slovenia, Italy and Croatia and, of course, the Commission."
"Finally, Mr Lebech mentioned the Nordic model as a source of inspiration for the Western Balkans in terms of regional cooperation."
"I believe that the Nordic Council has already played such a role: it has been used as the model for the Regional Cooperation Council for South-Eastern Europe, based in Sarajevo, which is now the forum for regional political cooperation in the Western Balkans."
"I find it encouraging that regional cooperation has substantially improved over the last couple of years and both Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have actively contributed to this success."
"We have clearly moved from a situation where, only a few years ago, regional cooperation was considered with significant suspicion that it was an attempt to recreate Yugoslavia."
"There is now a new understanding of its importance, both because of the concrete benefits on the ground - economic benefits, communications, transport, people-to-people contacts - and because regional cooperation moves the countries closer to the European Union."
"After all, cooperation across borders is what the European Union is all about."
"I want to thank you once again for a very responsible and substantive debate and congratulate the rapporteurs on their important contributions to this debate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to welcome to this House the new Commissioner, Mrs Androulla Vassiliou."
"Let me congratulate you on taking up your duties, Commissioner."
"I believe that we can look forward to fruitful cooperation in the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"rapporteur. - Madam President, our group congratulates you on your election."
"We supported that very much and we wish you all the best."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate, which has been highly productive and constructive."
"I should like to take up on what Mr Schmitt said regarding 2009."
"I believe we shall find a common solution tomorrow, as it is important to have a common broad base."
"Why has Croatia been successful?"
"This is because a broad consensus has been achieved in the country and, despite a slight disagreement with regard to the composition of the Joint EU Committee, this will hopefully be the case in future as well."
"It is also because - even if the country has sometimes had to force itself to do so - it has achieved a real consensus with its neighbours, as was the case with the fishing zone, for instance."
"Therefore - if I can now establish a link to Macedonia - I should like to make a very clear appeal to our counterparts in Macedonia to learn from this example, to try to reach a consensus at domestic level and also with its neighbours."
"It is easy, of course, to add fuel to the fire here and, like Mrs Beer, to act as a great advocate."
"As Mrs Pack and many others have said, however, both countries - Greece and Macedonia - have to make a move: and this within the next few days."
"Making a Macedonian domestic political crisis out of it at this point in time does not help Macedonia."
"It blocks the path to the EU; it prevents a solution being found with Greece."
"Hence the link with Croatia I mentioned."
"Croatia has succeeded thanks to three really very good governments - including the Račan and Sanader governments - which have really taken substantial steps forward and also changed their spots when 'national interests' were involved."
"Hence my appeal once again to continue to establish this common ground in Croatia, my appeal to attempt something similar in Macedonia as well, and my appeal to the Presidency to continue what it has been doing in recent weeks, namely making progress for the region as a whole."
"I am convinced, Commissioner, that the Commission will do everything it can to bring the negotiations to a close in 2009."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, I have heard a great deal of agreement here on Macedonia."
"Negotiations must come into view, and the difference of opinion with Greece over the name must be resolved."
"Apart from Mr Stoyanov, who is probably harking back to Macedonia's original association with Bulgaria under the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878, everyone, Greece included, wants to see Macedonia take its place as an equal in the European Union."
"Up to now, both parties have been expert in explaining the other party's long-standing commitment."
"Greece expects Macedonia to change its constitutional name, and until 2 April Macedonia expected Greece not to block its accession to the EU."
"Both parties fail to realise that all of this is completely incomprehensible to other Europeans."
"Both parties want this enlargement of the European Union to succeed, but at the same time are helping to delay it further."
"It now seems to be a game of who makes the first move."
"If no one does, the enlargement everyone desires will come to a temporary halt."
"I agree with Mr Kacin and Mr Pinior that we should not wait for any subsequent reports, but rather seize the first suitable opportunity to start negotiations with Macedonia."
"Madam President, I should like to conclude my speech in this joint debate on two candidate countries with one remark about Croatia for which my group has not requested separate speaking time."
"Croatia wanted to join the EU at the start of 2009, but it will be 2010 or 2011."
"The main problem still outstanding is shipbuilding on the Adriatic coast."
"It is not without reason that the EP delegation to Croatia is visiting the Rijeka shipyards on 29 April."
"In my group's opinion, we should not make any requirements of Croatia that the population could perceive as an insoluble problem and that could make the country's accession to the European Union unnecessarily controversial."
"In short, let us try to promote both countries' progress towards the European Union, so that, in a number of years' time, we are able to welcome both Croatia and Macedonia into our midst."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"in writing. - (RO) I believe the debate on the 2007 Report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should point out two key conclusions: the need for this country's continuous and firm progress toward integration into the European and transatlantic structures, as well as the importance of promoting the young generation in this republic."
"The European and transatlantic perspective of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is unanimously acknowledged and the 2007 Report welcomes the efforts made in this direction."
"Nevertheless, I would like to reiterate the importance of continuing these reforms."
"I also hope that the respect for the rights of ethnic and national minorities will continue to be a priority of the Macedonian Government in order to ensure a solid system of protecting all communities, including the Romanian-speaking people."
"In the end, I emphasize the need to promote the young generation in this republic."
"It is essential to provide them with all necessary conditions for high-performance education in the spirit of inter-cultural dialogue and mutual tolerance."
"The mobility and free movement of young Macedonians should be considered a key priority of relations between this country and the EU."
"in writing. - (IT) Today we approved the report by Mr Swoboda on Croatia, with a view to its accession."
"On behalf of fishermen throughout the Adriatic, I am delighted at the decision by this accession country not to apply the Ecological and Fishing Protection Zone in the Adriatic to EU Member States."
"If the situation had remained unchanged, we would have been facing unequal and utterly discriminatory treatment between Croatian and EU Member State fishermen."
"This is therefore a victory for the pacta sunt servanda principle, for diplomacy and for common sense."
"This is a victory once again for the abandonment of posturing to protect nationalistic interests in favour of commitment to the shared principles of the European Union."
"in writing. - Without any doubt, since the accession negotiations started, Croatia has made decisive efforts to comply with the requirements of the acquis communautaire."
"We are indeed glad to notice that a number of new negotiation chapters have been opened."
"The accession of Croatia should become a driving example for all other candidate and potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans."
"Despite the substantial efforts made by Croatia to meet EU standards, there are still areas where attention should given such as: the fight against corruption and organised crime, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal, the fight against all forms of discrimination (especially with regard to the Roma and national minorities), the sound use of Community funds, environmental protection measures and public administration reform."
"These points are essential, as further developments in the above areas would indeed bring greater stability to the country and to the region as a whole."
"It is clear that the stabilisation of the Western Balkans through the Europeanisation process should remain a top priority objective, for which the finalisation of the accession of Croatia will definitely be a major step forward."
"in writing. - It is an encouraging report about Macedonia's progress."
"The key to this progress is the renewed political consensus that has been achieved between different parties."
"Such a consensus greatly helped my country, Estonia, to succeed in the EU accession."
"Stabilising inter-ethnic relations, financial reforms and a successful fight against organised crime and corruption are just some landmarks of this progress."
"While guaranteeing minorities their rights we expect that the enlarged autonomy will be used in a responsible way to consolidate the Macedonian state as a whole."
"Macedonia should also be commended for keeping good-neighbourly relations both with Kosovo and Serbia."
"Macedonian citizens' entry into the EU countries has become an urgent problem."
"We need to apply as quickly as possible the same visa facilitation rules as those applying for Croatia."
"Against the background of the impressive progress Macedonia has achieved I strongly suggest that the Commission could start accession negotiations already in 2008."
"Finally, I appeal to our Greek friends to demonstrate good will and flexibility to reach a reasonable compromise that would enable Macedonia to free itself from the stigmatisation of Tito's communist federal state."
"in writing. - (RO) I would like to make a remark on the NATO Summit, which recently took place in Romania, and on the implications of the decisions adopted on some Union issues."
"In addition to other important decisions, it was decided that Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro, as well as Serbia, would benefit from increased cooperation with NATO."
"It was also decided that Ukraine and Georgia would receive the Action Plan for accession by a simplified procedure, when they are prepared."
"These decisions are salutary for the European Union: the intensified dialogue and the Action Plan mean more democracy, among other things, and more democracy at the Eastern borders will reduce the dimension of challenges in the field of internal affairs."
"More democracy and reforming the institutions in the neighbouring countries, such as Ukraine, means more protection at the external borders, more control over organized crime and a new step in spreading the values on which the European Union relies."
"in writing. - (PL) Croatia has made successful efforts to overcome existing divisions and to achieve unity between peoples, which is one of the aims of European Union membership."
"The accession of Croatia to the European Union would have enormous regional consequences and would help to test the scope of the obligations taken on by the EU for the Western Balkans."
"Croatia's considerable engagement in the accession negotiations is a positive sign, the evidence being provided by the large number of open chapters in the negotiations."
"It is also worth stressing that Croatia has made considerable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law."
"Immense and continuing engagement is, however, needed to overcome the problems that exist in individual sectors if reforms are to be pushed through."
"To facilitate integration, a list of the funds required for facilitation purposes needs to be drawn up."
"It is particularly important to accelerate the process of increasing the powers of the administration for the purpose of introducing new regulations."
"Acceleration is also required in the process of public sector reform, at local and regional authority level."
"The administration of justice is another sector requiring fundamental reform."
"One major achievement of the Croatian authorities is their unremitting efforts to have war crimes judged by national courts."
"The improvements noted in the Croatian economy and the reforms in the environmental protection sector are further achievements of the Croatian Government that facilitate the accession process."
"The report on the progress made by Croatia in 2007 supports the belief that this country, by implementing the goals facing it, is taking an active approach to the accession process."
"in writing. - Mr President, I welcome the progress that Croatia has made towards concluding the accession negotiations in 2009."
"Gradual integration of the former Yugoslav republics is crucial for stability in the Western Balkan region."
"Although there is still a lot of work to be done, especially in the areas of minority rights, border-related issues and judicial reform, Croatia should continue vigorously with its efforts to obtain membership of the EU as soon as possible in accordance with the accession criteria."
"Croatia's future membership is a logical next step, following the accession of Slovenia in 2004, to increase EU involvement in the region and encourage neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as all the other Western Balkan countries to continue with the consolidation of democracy."
"For the better administration of this process the Western Balkan region should follow the example of the Nordic Council."
"The Slovenian Presidency and the upcoming French Presidency should provide Croatia with all the necessary support to overcome the final obstacles on its way to becoming a member of the European Union."
"in writing. - (HU) Enlargement and integration of new Member States has been the European Union's most successful foreign policy."
"The next phase of this policy must involve the accession of Croatia to the European Union in the near future."
"Ethnic Hungarians in Romania of course pay close attention to ethnic conflicts taking place around the world, and we have been following events in former Yugoslavia's recent history too."
"The biggest lesson from its recent history is that intolerance on the part of the majority, ethnic impatience and nationalist extremism can easily lead a region into conflagration."
"Croatia has set an example in the region, in terms of both its political and its economic development since the end of the Yugoslav wars."
"Croatia's accession to the European Union must not be delayed; Member States' support for enlargement must not wane."
"We must provide the prospect of European Union membership to the whole of the Balkan region, including Serbia and Kosovo."
"Prompt accession of Croatia to the European Union will foster peaceful coexistence among the peoples of south-eastern Europe and contribute to stability and development in the region."
"With its exemplary recent past, Croatia has demonstrated that it is an integral part of the European family."
"in writing. - According to Eurostat data, Croatian GDP per capita stands at 53 per cent of the EU average."
"Croatia's GDP growth is at 6 percent."
"Clearly its GDP per capita is higher than Romania and Bulgaria and in all honesty, it is a shame that Croatia was not given the opportunity to join the European Union with Romania and Bulgaria."
"Over the centuries, Croatia has contributed many things to the cultural landscape of our continent."
"Let us make sure that we do not hinder its development and ensure that it does not have to wait longer than 2009 to become a Member State."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(MT) I would like to start by saying that I, too, congratulate the new Commissioner, Mrs Vassiliou."
"Madam President, the decision that we are going to take tomorrow to approve the granting of almost EUR 700 000 from the Globalisation Fund to 675 Maltese workers who lost their jobs with the companies VF and Bortex in Malta is a display of solidarity, and solidarity is a main pillar of the European Union."
"If the European Union means anything, it is this; that yes, the Member States should open up their economies and markets to competition, but at the same time they are not alone, and the European Union is there to facilitate challenges, to help us exploit them and to reduce the negative impact that may result from them."
"Madam President, today the workers of VF and Bortex have a better idea of what solidarity means and a better idea of what the European Union means, and I, from here, salute them."
"(RO) The recent demonstrations in Ljubljana have brought to the forefront the subject of salary differences between women and men, as a negative factor in the achievement of the social cohesion desideratum."
"Although we have made important progress at the European Union level, there is still a 15% difference and, in Romania, a 13% difference."
"I would like to call attention to a problem that persists in the public sector, namely in the fields where mainly women work - healthcare, social assistance, education, light industry and public administration - which are some of the most poorly remunerated."
"I welcome the support Commissioner Špidla has shown in the issue of eliminating salary differences and I believe it is necessary to accelerate the measures contained in the related action plan, especially Item 2 - salary differences as the main component of employment policies."
"Madam President, I would like to say a few words on the implementation of the Habitats Directive in Ireland, with particular reference to turf-cutting on raised bogs."
"Irish turf-cutters and bog owners are now being asked to cease cutting turf for personal use."
"This situation has arisen because of the unrestricted industrial and commercial turf-cutting right across the EU, which has resulted in virtually all of Europe's raised bogs being destroyed."
"It is vitally important to understand that for many Irish people, both rural and urban, turf-cutting has been practised for generations."
"These people should not be made to pay the price for the destruction of bogs by others."
"Also, given that oil is now fetching approximately EUR 110 per barrel, we can see that turf is now a very valuable economic resource for the individuals concerned."
"In this context, at national level there must be full compensation for the loss of turf-cutting rights, and flexible arrangements will have to be put in place so that we can balance the rights of owners against the need to conserve the raised bogs."
"(ES) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"I would like to ask the European Commission to act quickly regarding the problem that the accredited Spanish press is experiencing in the Kingdom of Morocco: the Moroccan Government is coercing and threatening to expel the Spanish accredited press for covering the conflict in the Sahara."
"Since January of this year, Televisión Española, TV3 and Canal Sur have not been allowed permission to broadcast due to the coverage that they have been giving to the conflict, and recently the correspondent for Cadena COPE has been threatened with expulsion, along with Cadena SER and the newspaper La Vanguardia."
"I think that it is unacceptable, with our neighbourhood policy, for a government - the Government of Morocco - to create a serious problem of freedom of expression and to threaten the whole of the Spanish accredited press in the Kingdom of Morocco, unlike the rest of the European press."
"I therefore call for a rapid, forceful response from the European Commission in order to put an end to this situation."
"(SK) Right at the start of my speech I want to say that I am not happy to see two neighbouring countries that are both part of today's common Europe washing their dirty linen here in the European Parliament."
"What is the case of the Hungarian village of Mlynky about?"
"According to the latest statistics, 54% of the village's inhabitants are Slovaks."
"The mayor of Mlynky has evicted five Slovak associations from the two rooms in which they carried out their activities."
"Let me say that when it comes to treatment of the Slovak minority, this act is only the tip of the iceberg."
"In a Slovak school in the Hungarian village, Slovak is taught as a foreign language for 3 hours a week and a priest says mass in Hungarian."
"The bilingual village paper is not published any more."
"I want to thank the Hungarian President, Mr Sólyom, who visited the village right at the beginning and listened to both parties."
"I also want to thank the Hungarian Ombudsman, who in this case favours the Slovak minority."
"The local authorities, however, seem to be standing their ground."
"The friendship bridge near the town of Ostrihom, paid for with EU funds, is only 30 kilometres away from this village."
"I hope that friendship prevails in this area, the friendship symbolised by this bridge."
"(PL) Madam President, in Bucharest the Germans stood against an official invitation to Ukraine and Georgia to join NATO."
"The reason they gave was their concern and anxiety that relations with Russia should not deteriorate."
"The Germans know, however, that Russia's fears are entirely groundless, as NATO is a defensive pact and has done much to maintain peace in Europe and many regions of the world."
"The questions therefore arise as to what, whom and against whom the Germans wish to arm and represent in the progressively unifying Europe of the 21st century."
"Surely not against states in south-eastern Europe, including Ukraine and Georgia, with their experience of Soviet occupation?"
"In this progressively unifying Europe, do the Germans wish to resurrect the phantoms and demons of 20th century politics, i.e. unions and pacts that led to wars, crimes, the Holocaust and the division of Europe?"
"Is the position taken by Germany in Bucharest a warning signal that a common European foreign policy may be realised at the bidding of the Germans, looking after their own interests, but forgetting the bitter truth of history?"
"(PL) Madam President, the Council of Europe was set up to protect human rights - which includes the right of every person to life - and to promote common fundamental values while at the same time strengthening security for the citizens of Europe, and this constitutes a denial of the right to kill."
"Meanwhile, at its plenary session on 16 April 2008 the Parliamentary Assembly will be examining a report entitled 'Access to safe and legal abortion in Europe', in which it is recommended that women are guaranteed access to abortion, that obstacles to the performance of abortions are removed, and that contraceptives are made available at low cost, including early-abortion methods, which is not only harmful from a medical aspect, but also highly unethical."
"I would like to express my opposition to the report, which, in denying the aims for which the Council of Europe was set up, amounts to the promotion of murder of the most defenceless and of contraception."
"(FR) Madam President, the energy and climate package marks the arrival of a new kind of blackmail: blackmail using carbon emissions."
"Having announced 575 job losses at Gandrange in Moselle on 4 April 2008, Arcelor-Mittal is agreeing to keep 124 jobs on the site provided that it can have CO2 emissions certificates."
"And to sweeten the pill of the job losses in Lorraine, Arcelor-Mittal is allowing rumours to circulate of a possible pilot CO2 capture project, although this process has not yet been validated in terms of its energy neutrality."
"Gandrange in Moselle is becoming the Trojan horse of the energy-intensive industries, with their great defender in the European Council, the French President, Mr Sarkozy."
"I am delighted that the Commissioner is with us because I would really like us to reject this new kind of blackmail using carbon emissions."
"To be effective, the energy and climate package must follow the beat of European legislation."
"The European Parliament must demand that the Council comply with the rules we are set and not give in to the sirens of industry seeking free quotas."
"We as co-legislator must ensure fair access to quotas for European SMEs against the large industrial companies."
"(HU) Hungarian citizens who emigrated from Romania to Hungary and became pensioners after 2007 following Romania's accession to the European Union have not yet received the pension they are entitled to for their years of pensionable service in Romania."
"On the basis of the agreement in force between Romania and the other members of the European Union, from 1 January 2007 the Romanian authorities were supposed to make pension payments directly to those affected."
"For some months now, the Romanians have failed to do this, and Hungarian citizens drawing their pension from the time of Romania's accession in 2007 are only receiving the portion of their pension due to them in Hungary."
"The Romanian authorities tend to procrastinate when it comes to settling such matters, despite the fact that the relevant EU directives are supposed to be in force in Romania too."
"Since it is the job of the European Commission to oversee compliance with EU directives, I ask the Commission to investigate what is happening in Romania as regards assessment and payment of pensions, and to call the attention of the Romanian authorities to the need to resolve this problem as soon as possible."
"It is small consolation that these pensioners would win their case in Luxembourg. Thank you very much."
"(SK) The local government in the Hungarian village of Mlynky, where 55% of the inhabitants are Slovak, approved the mayor's proposal to evict two Slovak minority organisations from the traditional 'Slovak House'."
"The organisations protested to the local authorities in writing, drawing attention in their letter to the fact that it was a violation of the existing status and damaged the national interests of the Slovak minority in Mlynky."
"In any case, the decision to evict them is not a random act."
"It follows a decision made by the local authorities to stop publishing a bilingual magazine, change TV broadcasting to the detriment of minority broadcasting and reduce the wages paid to Slovak teachers."
"This is a general negative trend and I must protest against such actions."
"These actions and decisions are dangerous primarily because they interfere, in a fundamental and perhaps premeditated way, with the minority status in the area in question and lower the existing standards on minority rights."
"The Hungarian Ombudsman for national and ethnic minorities, Mr Kállai, denounced these decisions as incomprehensible."
"The actions of the local government in Mlynky, which repeatedly attacks the Slovak minority, are a very bad signal, particularly at a time when senior officials of the Slovak and Hungarian Governments are planning the meeting of their respective prime ministers, from which an improvement in relations between our countries is clearly expected."
"(SK) Some Members of the European Parliament have voiced their concerns about the construction of a coal-fired power plant in the town of Trebišov in eastern Slovakia."
"I should point out that the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak Republic has rejected this idea and does not expect construction of the power plant to go ahead, within the framework of energy security in the Slovak Republic, before 2030."
"I want to give my support to the efforts of the citizens of Trebišov, who bravely oppose the construction of this power plant, too."
"I also want to stress that the former Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Mr Mikuláš Dzurinda, and other politicians who are worried about the negative impact the power plant would have on the environment and on the quality of life in Trebišov, and about its negative impact on the unique Tokay winegrowing region bordering Ukraine and Hungary, have lent their support to the actions of the citizens of Trebišov."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give the Commission and the Presidency of our Parliament and of the Council some information, if I may."
"If we obtain recognition from Beijing, even if incidental, that in all his public appearances and declarations in the last few years the Dalai Lama has never asked for independence but has always asked for autonomy, and if it is also acknowledged that in all his public appearances he has urged non-violence, this declaration from Beijing could immediately be interpreted as a gesture of openness and goodwill by the government in exile and the Dalai Lama himself."
"I hope this is the direction we want to move in."
"(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Finance Ministers have decided not to agree on a Europe-wide increase in wages to counter the rising cost of living."
"We all know of the demonstrations that took place in Ljubljana."
"My fellow Member who spoke just now has already referred to them."
"We all know too about the increase in the cost of living that has ruined middle- and low-income groups."
"What has the EU done about this?"
"Nothing whatsoever!"
"Instead, the wages of large company executives continue to go up, while ordinary workers find surviving until the end of the month increasingly difficult."
"Let me point out in conclusion that Mr Almunia indicated the impact of a possible increase in wages on productivity."
"Such statements are a slap in the face for the hundreds of thousands of workers in financial difficulty."
"The huge profits of multinationals are, of course, no secret."
"(SK) The recent actions of the Hungarian Guard against the Roma represent a serious threat to the basic principles on which today's Europe has been built, as does the fact that is openly advocating extremism and revisionism and looking for an external enemy in neighbouring countries and among other countries' nationals; this alongside the continuous activity, on the increase with new members of this organisation sworn in less than two weeks ago, and the support it receives from political parties and groups of similar stripes both inside and outside Hungary."
"This is not only a growing threat but also a challenge, which fundamentally affects not just all people with democratic views in Hungary and neighbouring countries, but Europe as a whole."
"Displays of aggressive nationalism, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism or neo-fascism do not have, and must not have, a place in democratic Europe."
"These phenomena cannot be seen as relative and marginal events, nor can they be justified in any way."
"This is why I am calling on the European institutions to start dealing with this matter in earnest."
"(PL) The Erasmus Mundus programme, which is intended to spread intercultural understanding and promote the European Union through its very good results in education, is not accessible to young people in Belarus."
"Belarus is a country with no respect for human rights, a country where national minorities and trade unions are discriminated against and displaying a civic attitude results in persecution."
"Young people in particular are punished for their convictions by being deprived of opportunities for education."
"We must find a way to enable young people in Belarus who are suffering discrimination in terms of access to knowledge in their own country to gain access to the benefits of the Erasmus Mundus programme."
"Warsaw University and other educational institutions have admitted students who have been expelled from educational institutions in Belarus for taking part in demonstrations."
"I hope that the European Union will find a suitable formula to resolve this problem."
"Mr President, this coming weekend the second phase of the largest commercial seal hunt in the world is about to begin off the coast of Atlantic Canada."
"The Canadian Government has given its assurance that this hunt will be conducted humanely and, as a condition of their licences, sealers are now required to stun seals and check they are unconscious and then bleed them out before they are skinned."
"Yet, according to independent observers, there is little evidence of this happening. That is, of course, when they have actually been permitted to observe sealing activities."
"The Department of Fisheries' systematic attempts to block the observation of this year's hunt have been almost as alarming as the blatant violations of the sealing regulations that have thus far been recorded."
"If the Canadian authorities are so very confident that these regulations are being adhered to, then why are they doing their utmost to prevent animal welfare specialists and journalists from witnessing it?"
"Moreover, we should not forget that no such animal welfare guarantees have ever been made for the commercial seal hunts elsewhere in the world, such as Russia and Namibia."
"With the current legislature coming to an end, it is vital that the Commission take swift action, in response to Written Declaration 38, by publishing a proposal to ban the import and export of and trade in seal products."
"Such a ban would not affect subsistence farming, but it would demonstrate a commitment to protect animal welfare."
"(PT) Mr President, in Portugal at the moment more multinationals are threatening to relocate a part of their production, as is the case with Yasaki Saltano and Delphi."
"In both cases these multinationals, producers of car parts, received millions of euros of Community funding for setting up their factories and for vocational training of their workers."
"Now, claiming that the car industry is experiencing problems, Yasaki Saltano wants to make more than 400 workers redundant in Vila Nova de Gaia."
"Approximately 70% are women, many of them with health problems such as tendinitis caused by their work for the company."
"Two questions arise in this connection: what is the position with regard to the social responsibility of those companies and when will measures be taken to prevent such relocation in defence of workers' rights and production in our countries?"
"(HU) First Kosovo, now Tibet."
"In both cases, violent colonialist policy pursued by nationalist-communist police states has resulted in bloodshed."
"In both cases, the refusal to honour a people's right to self-determination has triggered a crisis that threatens world peace as a whole."
"The Nobel peace laureate, the Dalai Lama has exposed the cultural genocide and demographic aggression inflicted on the people of Tibet."
"In formerly Communist Romania too, these were familiar methods."
"Ceauşescu too considered oppression of minorities to be a Romanian domestic issue, just as China has asserted in the case of Tibet."
"May the European Parliament stand alongside Pope Benedict XVI in taking action against injustice, hatred and violence; may it, too, take up the fight to secure territorial autonomy for Tibet."
"Let us look forward to the Dalai Lama and the Roman Catholic Pope telling the world here in Europe's Parliament that there is no peace without justice."
"(SK) The hottest topic at the 10th meeting of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee held in the European Parliament in February was improving visa processing."
"Following the enlargement of the Schengen area in the end of last year, the conditions under which Ukrainian citizens are granted visas for EU countries have become stricter; the fees and waiting time have increased."
"A new Berlin Wall must not be erected at the EU's external borders just at a time when Ukraine is deciding on its future."
"That is why I welcome the agreement between Slovakia and Ukraine on local border traffic."
"It will make it easier to make frequent crossings of the Slovak-Ukrainian state border in border regions for social, cultural, economic or family reasons."
"A speedy solution to the visa regime issues would help to convince Ukrainian citizens of the benefits of EU membership."
"(PL) Mr President, one positive outcome of the latest enlargement of the Schengen area has been the elimination of controls at internal EU borders."
"Poland has of course removed all control points and consequently in my province alone we have shut down as many as 55 border crossings."
"Their closure has, however, presented the local authorities with a need to manage the remaining infrastructure."
"This comprises a number of buildings, towers, hangars, warehouses and parking areas along with adjacent land, excellently positioned, often beside important international communication routes."
"The local government districts in which these facilities are located are interested in managing them, but they do not have the funds to do so."
"There is consequently a high degree of likelihood that all these facilities will be used for commercial purposes."
"I am therefore appealing to the European Commission to set up a special fund that will help districts in border areas to manage this infrastructure for public utility purposes, including trans-border purposes, thus promoting cultural integration."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to express my respect for the brave mountain people of Tibet who are fighting for national independence."
"What I have to say is not a demonstration against the Chinese."
"On the contrary. I have respect for the Chinese people, who also fought for national freedom against the Japanese occupation, and for freedom and civil liberties inside China itself - an example of this being the Boxer Rebellion in the 19th century."
"This is all the more reason why the Chinese, with this tradition in mind, should not refuse the people of Tibet the right to self-determination."
"As Members of the European Parliament we must make our solidarity with Tibet evident, not only in words, but also through deeds."
"European politicians should not lend credibility to the Beijing Games by attending them."
"We should stay away from Beijing at this time. I say this as a keen fan and observer of the Athens Olympics."
"For our part this is the least we can do."
"Mr President, tomorrow is the 10th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement."
"Some find much to celebrate; I do not."
"Why?"
"Because it is the Belfast Agreement which rewarded 30 years of terrorism in Northern Ireland by undermining both justice and democracy: justice, by granting an early-release amnesty to all duly convicted terrorist prisoners; and democracy, by prescribing that unrepentant terrorists must be included in the government of the region they ravaged for decades."
"That is to be achieved by the iniquity of mandatory coalition."
"The region which I represent is the only region in all of the European Union where citizens are denied the fundamental, democratic right to vote a party out of office."
"Why?"
"Because the Belfast Agreement by law stipulates that all parties must be in government if there is to be a government."
"That is the Belfast Agreement and that is wrong."
"It is something to be denounced, not celebrated."
"(BG) Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, one of the greatest challenges faced by my country, Bulgaria, during the first years of its membership in the Community has been to ensure transparency and prevent any misuse of resources absorbed from the European funds."
"In support of anticorruption efforts, I have initiated the establishment of a Public Council for citizens' monitoring of the absorption of EU funds in Bulgarian agriculture."
"This will not be a formal institution but a civil society formation to pool the efforts of all who want to make sure that this opportunity to boost Bulgaria's development would not be squandered away due to corruption, misuse and mismanagement."
"The great goal is to set up mechanisms for public control and general access to information on how funds are spent in agriculture, information on project implementation and dissemination of best practices in the sector."
"Let us remember that promoting active citizen involvement in socio-political processes is a key priority on the Community's agenda."
"(RO) More than one year after Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU and almost nine years after the beginning of the Bologna process, eight European countries do not acknowledge the university degrees and other qualifications obtained in these two Member States."
"Many times, Romanian citizens are discriminated when they wish to become employed or continue their education abroad."
"The non-recognition of diplomas also contributes to low participation in European student mobility programmes, especially as regards postgraduate diplomas."
"For instance, a Romanian student could not participate in a master degree programme financed by Erasmus-Mundus in a university centre from any of the eight Member States that will not acknowledge the student's basic university degree."
"This is discrimination against the citizens of a Member State and its result is the limitation of their chances to obtain European funds for academic mobility."
"The European Commission has recently condemned this conduct."
"I believe the European Parliament should have the same firm attitude in this respect."
"(RO) On the background of climate change and in the context of primary natural resources, especially energy resources, becoming ever fewer and more expensive, a common agricultural policy could represent an efficient instrument for achieving the European Union objectives."
"On the other hand, non-compliance with the Community rules in the field of agricultural expenses currently leads to the recovery of no less than 83 million euros by the European Commission from eleven Member States."
"It is not a very large amount; but since the common agricultural policy is financed from public funds, I believe a more sustained involvement from the European Commission in assisting the Member States is necessary, especially in assisting the newly-integrated states, so that such irregularities would be considerably diminished and food security and safety would truly be an achievable objective in the European Union."
"(RO) The Commission will soon propose a new amendment to the Directive on charging heavy vehicles for access to the transport infrastructure."
"By 2008, the Commission has to present, after examining all options, including the costs related to environmental protection, noise, traffic congestion and health, a generally applicable, transparent and comprehensive model for the assessment of all external costs, which would define and serve as a basis for the subsequent calculation of the charges for using infrastructures."
"Any revenue collected in this manner should be reinvested in the related infrastructures."
"Road carriers need specially equipped parking areas where drivers can rest under conditions of complete safety, as well as their vehicles and carried goods."
"I believe the Member States should be financially supported and, at the same time, forced to invest more in building safe parking areas, improving and developing the transport infrastructure."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, European Union Member States from Estonia to Poland lost millions and millions of their most talented and enterprising citizens to Nazi aggression and the decades-long Soviet terror."
"The European Parliament report 'Citizens for Europe' established the action entitled 'Active European Remembrance'."
"It was aimed equally at preventing Nazism and Stalinism and at commemorating the victims of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes."
"Now, 70 years on from Stalin and Hitler's secret pact, there is still a lack of awareness in Europe of the outrages of Stalin's apparatus of coercion."
"The Member States should establish a standing inter-governmental working group with the task of carrying out an impartial examination of the crimes of the Bolsheviks and the KGB and assessing them using European values."
"Today, however, the date 23 August should be designated European Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism."
"On 23 August 1939 the Nazis and the Bolsheviks carved Europe into two spheres of influence."
"In so doing they inflicted a terrible wound on Europe which has not totally healed to this day."
"(RO) I would like to use this opportunity to speak in the European Parliament plenum about the history of the NATO Summit hosted by Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on 2 - 4 April."
"We all know the importance of NATO, both for the security of the Euro-Atlantic area and for the democratization and welfare of the newly-integrated countries."
"This happened to Romania in 2004 and we hope the same will happen to Croatia and Albania, the countries invited to join NATO in Bucharest."
"I am convinced that the crisis regarding the name of Macedonia will also be solved by the dialogue with Greece, so that another reliable partner of the European Union, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, would be invited to join NATO."
"We also know that accession to NATO is an important step for integration into the European Union."
"As a member of the ALDE Group in the European Parliament, I welcome NATO's openness to Ukraine and Georgia, as a decisive signal for including these countries on the European path."
"I am confident that we, the European Union, in general, and the European Parliament in particular, will also have the openness to encourage Ukraine and Georgia to undertake the correct path, the European path."
"(PL) Mr President, the process of ratification of the EU Reform Treaty is continuing."
"Following in the footsteps of the French, Romanian, Slovenian and Hungarian parliaments, among others, the Polish Parliament has also taken decisions on ratification."
"There would perhaps not be anything untoward about this, but for the fact that MPs ratified the Treaty in a great hurry and often failed to get to grips with its content."
"In view of this situation, the numerous initiatives to ratify the Treaty through national referendums are entirely justified."
"In a democracy, after all, the citizen is sovereign, not the MP, and the most important form of expression is a referendum, not votes that compromise MPs and parliaments."
"Citizens have a right not to recognise ratification of the Treaty without it having been read."
"These facts already constitute a basis for future political and national conflicts, and everything was in fact supposed to take place in accordance with human rights and the will of free states and peoples in the name of the common good."
"(PL) Mr President, in my speech I would like to raise the issue of respect for rights of ownership, the rights of peoples and the rights of religious minorities in Ukraine, which has declared a wish to accede to the European Union."
"In 1962 the Soviet authorities closed the Catholic church of St Magdalena in Lwów and turned it into an organ recital hall, destroying many valuable relics in the process."
"Since 1991 the inhabitants of Lwów have been struggling to reclaim their church dedicated to St Magdalena, so far without success."
"Bearing in mind the reconciliation between the Polish and Ukrainian peoples, I would like to appeal, through the forum of the European Parliament, to the authorities of the city of Lwów for the return of the church to the church authorities, in order to deepen the friendship between our peoples, Polish and Ukrainian, and also in order for this church to become a symbol of reconciliation, which is so important in view of the approaching Euro 2012 Championship."
"(RO) I would like to raise the issue of the people suffering from leukaemia, who die every day in Romania or in other Member States, without being able to do anything because certain countries are not included in the international register of non-family donors."
"This register exists in Europe but, unfortunately, not all the Member States have access to this register."
"In Romania, this register does not function."
"This shortcoming has led to a much higher mortality rate in Romania than in the other Member States."
"Hundreds of young people die every day for the simple reason that they don't have access to this register."
"Nevertheless, this problem is not a priority for the current government in Romania."
"I would like the Member States to have equal access to this register."
"This would lead to the decrease in illicit trade in organs and would offer people suffering from leukaemia a chance for life, no matter what their financial situation."
"I also believe that ill people should benefit from bone marrow transplants according to the seriousness of their condition and not their nationality."
"Taking into consideration that today we have voted in favour of investing Commissioner Vassiliou, I request Madame Commissioner to find a solution to this problem."
"All European institutions, including the Parliament, should support an information campaign."
"(RO) Last week, Romania had the honor to host the Bucharest NATO Summit."
"As Rapporteur on regional cooperation in the Black Sea area, I would like to welcome the organization of this crucial event in the Black Sea region but, in particular, the explicit acknowledgement of the strategic importance of this area."
"I hope this acknowledgement will mean consolidated and concrete efforts at the level of the European Union and NATO in order to transform the Black Sea into an area of stability and prosperity and ensure the security of the entire European continent."
"No less important is the acknowledgement of Georgia's and Ukraine's transatlantic aspirations."
"These two countries' path to joining NATO should be irreversible, and the years 2008-2009 should become significant in recording progress in this direction, both from the two countries and from NATO."
"In conclusion, I welcome the fact that the member states of the Alliance have proved flexibility and long-term vision, thus transforming the Bucharest Summit into an important benchmark for NATO enlargement and for the subsequent development of the security system."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, once again in the last few days, in Saint-Nazaire in France, some workers - this time Greek - employed by a German subcontractor to another subcontractor in the shipbuilding industry, have gone unpaid."
"European Court of Justice jurisprudence has reaffirmed the employment rights of workers seconded within the EU, but how effective are these rights if Europe is not equipped with the necessary legislation to compensate for the failings of subcontractors?"
"We are no longer talking about isolated cases."
"Throughout the European Union, order-givers are increasingly using tiers of subcontractors from other Member States, and cases of seconded workers not being paid are becoming more common."
"Three men, three Greek employees, finally obtained payment of their wages, but only after three weeks of hunger strike."
"We cannot make grandiloquent speeches about Europe and do nothing."
"It is essential that, as soon as possible, we come up with the necessary legal arsenal for order-givers to be held responsible for the failings of subcontractors."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the parallel between the Olympic Games in Beijing and in Moscow 28 years ago."
"Granting the right to hold the Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980 was probably an artful plan designed by Jimmy Carter's administration and his national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, to open the Soviet Union, at least for a short period, to the West and its democratic influence."
"Our goal is to trigger democratisation in China and therefore we should appreciate the chance for such an international presence in a country that is otherwise rather isolated."
"Also, in boycotting the Beijing Olympics, we deprive the Chinese authorities of their triumph."
"We also lose the opportunity to introduce democratic values to the Chinese people at grassroots level."
"Our presence at the Olympic Games in Beijing should not be viewed as an acceptance of the Chinese authorities but as an effort to make the Chinese people see the need for the transition to a new regime."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the 25 fellow Members who signed a letter to the Cambodian Prime Minister and dictator Hun Sen, bringing up the case of Saumura Tioulong, one of the leaders of the Sam Rainsy Party."
"I would also like to bring this case to the attention of the Commission."
"We have information that there is a real risk that Saumura Tioulong, who is also a member of the non-violent radical party, will be arrested in Cambodia."
"So far it has not happened, and I hope this is partly due to the intervention of my fellow Members, but it is a situation that needs to be monitored very closely."
"I would also like to use this time to let the President and all my fellow Members know that the Chinese embassy sent us all a letter which speaks of the separatist nature of the Dalai Lama's 'gang' which, according to this letter, would by nature be violent."
"It seems to me that this is one of the statements and ideas we need to help the Chinese regime to overcome in order to bring democracy to China, Tibet and elsewhere."
"(BG) In the past 48 hours, there have been three contract killings in Sofia, Bulgaria."
"Since Roumen Petkov, the current Minister of Interior, took office, a total of 22 contract killings of business people, mafia bosses and politicians have been carried out in Bulgaria."
"Not a single one has been solved, not a single person has been convicted."
"On Monday, in the bright of day, writer Georgi Stoev was murdered."
"He authored several books of investigations into organised crime."
"In the meantime it has emerged that Minister Petkov had been in communication with criminal elements on a regular basis and even met with such individuals."
"These facts are a clear indication of the complete merging of government and mafia."
"What I am saying is that Bulgaria's Interior Minister is a mafia guy."
"During the pre-accession period, the Bulgarian people were told that the Union would be a safeguard to ensure success against banditism and killings, a guardian of stability and security, for a life free of crime."
"Today, when anyone of us could become the next victim, the Union needs to act in order to clear away this shameful sore."
"Not only off Bulgaria but off itself."
"(BG) Mister President, colleagues, the occasion that makes me take the floor is yet another tragic incident in Bulgaria a few days ago which forces us to break our silence."
"On Monday, in the centre of Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, writer Georgi Stoev was shot dead in a demonstrative assassination."
"In a series of ten or so books he dared shed light on the whole truth about organised crime in our country and its close ties with the political elite and the judiciary."
"This contract killing, one of many, has shown with ruthless clarity that the prosecution office, the judicial system and the Ministry of Interior in our country either do not have the might to deal with crime or, which even more scary, lack the will to do so."
"Through their inaction, they are turning into accomplices in crimes and are being used solely for political racketeering of nonconformists."
"It is not by chance that Mr. Barroso, the President of the European Commission himself said so directly during his recent visit to Bulgaria."
"The bitter truth is that in Bulgaria no one feels safe for their lives anymore and we have to admit that without help from Europe, statehood in our country is at stake."
"Mr President, the European Court of Human Rights has passed 24 rulings on appeals originating from inhabitants of Chechnya - 200 more are pending."
"The Court has found Russia responsible for shocking human rights abuses in Chechnya that include murder, torture and illegal detention."
"These abuses are continuing."
"In addition, up to 5 000 people have 'disappeared' - mostly murdered - at the hands of the state security services."
"Incredibly, not a single official has been held responsible for these acts."
"I call on the EU, the Commission and the Council to make it clear to President Medvedev that Russia's full compliance with the rulings of the Strasbourg Court will be a high-priority EU expectation with a view to resuming further partnership."
"Mr President, I undertook a week-long mission to Chad in an effort to raise public awareness about the humanitarian crisis, particularly in the east of the country."
"I also wanted to assess what possible positive impact the EU peacekeeping mission led by Ireland could have in this present stage of its ongoing deployment in Chad."
"Approximately 250 000 Sudanese refugees have crossed over the border since 2003, almost all of whom are located in 12 camps in the east of the country."
"There are also about 180 000 IDPs in eastern Chad who have moved and continue to move, fleeing inter-ethnic violence."
"The World Food Programme in eastern Chad is now faced with the daunting challenge of pre-positioning six months of food supplies before the rainy season for these refugees and IDPs."
"Donor contributions are urgently required to ensure that purchases are completed in the coming months and that the food reaches Chad on time."
"Regarding EUFOR, which is to provide protection for refugees, some of the members of the French military mission are now forming part of EUFOR."
"It is important that EUFOR is not seen as an extension of the French operations in Chad."
"Mr President, in the six weeks since the election of Mr Christofias as the new President of Cyprus, more progress has been made towards trying to find a lasting solution on the island than in the previous four years."
"The atmosphere in Cyprus is full of renewed hope, but one thing is threatening to destroy the euphoric climate. This is the continued interference of the Turkish Army."
"A week ago the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Army paid a sudden visit to Cyprus and made a number of inflammatory statements that almost stopped the peace process in its tracks."
"Today, the commander of the Turkish land forces was due to go to Cyprus and his presence is expected to create more problems for the peace negotiations."
"I urge the President of this House and all my colleagues to use any diplomatic means at their disposal to strongly point out to the Turkish generals in Ankara that they should stop trying to destroy the peace dialogue in Cyprus and leave the Cypriots free to get on with the job of finding a solution to their island's intercommunal problems."
"Thank you, and may I also say, Mr President, how grateful we all are for your generosity in allowing so many people to speak this afternoon."
"Mr President, the European Union is the largest exporter in the world today."
"This position is also due to the economic diversity of its Member States, some of which rely mostly on services and others on manufacturing."
"In order to sustain the leading position of European exporters, we have to make sure that they compete in a fair global trade environment."
"The Community trade defence instruments that are meant to provide assurances for European economic operators in international trade need to be reformed."
"The use of the trade defence instruments has to be more accessible, more efficient and more transparent."
"The reformed Community trade defence instruments need to be equally accessible and efficient for stakeholders from both service-based economies and economies that have strong manufacturing sectors."
"They need to be equally accessible to the new and old Member States."
"The temptation of protectionism has to be strongly discouraged."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, on 5 April, the Christian orthodox priest Youssef Adel was assassinated by unknown assailants in the centre of Baghdad."
"The Chaldean archbishop of Mosul, Monsignor Rahho, was kidnapped at the end of February."
"Parliament did not react and his body was found in mid-March."
"If the international community turns a blind eye, peace will never come to this region."
"The financial resources provided by the European Union will be wasted if the European Union does not protect the local population."
"I am asking the Commission to look into the possibility of managing the European funds committed to Iraq for as long as Iraqi Christians remain targets of violence, kidnapping, murder and bomb attacks."
"I ask our President to make a joint declaration with the Council on our behalf stating that it strongly condemns the persecution of civilian, humanitarian, health and religious personnel in Iraq."
"(PL) We are approaching the fourth anniversary of the most important enlargement of the Union - an enlargement which incorporated 10 new Member States."
"For the most part these are countries that require considerable expenditure and considerable support funds for modernising and transforming the economy."
"Then Bulgaria and Romania joined too. These enlargements were very cheap for the European Union's budget."
"The benefits from enlargement were felt by both the old and the new Member States."
"We are in the process of ratifying the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is a major success, but at the same time, during discussion of the future of the Union, there is talk of a diminution of the budget for the years 2014-2020."
"How do we think we are going to respond to these new challenges, new challenges for an enlarged Europe, if we are going to devote less money to matters of such importance for Europe, for the world, and for the European Union?"
"That concludes the one-minute speeches."
"Combating cancer in the enlarged EU (debate)"
"(PT) The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on combating cancer in the enlarged European Union, by Miroslav Ouzký, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - B6-0015/2008)."
"Commissioner Vassiliou is with us for the first time to take part in this debate."
"Welcome, Commissioner;"
"I hope you will feel at home among us."
"Your speech, when the moment comes, will mark the beginning of your cooperation and collaboration with the European Parliament."
"author. - (CS) First of all, I would like to take this opportunity, as the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to congratulate the Commissioner, who was nominated and appointed to the Commission today."
"Although serious reasons prevented me from listening to her presentation in person, I must say that she made an excellent impression on the members of my committee and was unanimously welcomed in her new capacity."
"Regarding the oral question, I would like to begin by explaining what made us tackle this issue and ask individual states to pay more attention to this serious diagnosis."
"You probably know, from the emphasis in the report and in the question, that cancer cases in Europe are on the increase."
"There are a number of reasons for this: as we know, the population is ageing and more and more people are exposed to carcinogens."
"According to the trade unions, at least 8% of annual cancer deaths are directly caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace."
"We have to bear in mind that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease."
"Another important matter is the significant differences in cancer treatment success rates between the old and new Member States."
"This imbalance is surely also food for thought."
"What can we do in this area and what can we recommend to the European Community?"
"A structure such as the EU undoubtedly has the capacity and power to coordinate individual national policies."
"By adopting national cancer control programmes we can reduce cancer mortality by as much as 30%."
"We know that only 3% of the total budget in developed countries is spent on cancer prevention, compared with 97% on treatment."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to make an appeal on behalf of patients, who become the focus of our treatment and should become the focus of our care: they should have better access to new scientific knowledge and new information."
"The European Union should push ahead with a single register and, as far as possible, common education."
"Paradoxically, the European Union has not yet introduced in all its Member States as undeniably important a topic as oncology."
"Although oncology is an interdisciplinary subject, its recognition as a subject in its own right is a necessary condition if we want to successfully fight this disease."
"Since I would like to allow my colleague from the PPE-DE Group, Professor Trakatellis, to use some of my speaking time, I will now conclude my introduction."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is my first official appearance before Parliament, so let me firstly express my thanks to its Members for placing their trust in me through their vote."
"I repeat what I said at my hearing: I aim to cooperate with MEPs fruitfully and to the best of my ability."
"Now, Mr President, to the subject of cancer:"
"In addition to the priority given to cancer by you and by the Slovenian Presidency, this issue has been a particular concern of mine for many years, so I am pleased that it is the first topic for me to address in front of the plenary."
"Every year 3.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with cancer, but this burden is not spread equally across the Union."
"For example, the most recent data shows that cervical cancer is over four times higher in Bulgaria than in Finland, and the risk of dying from cervical cancer is almost five times higher in Lithuania than in Italy."
"These variations show that there is scope to do better across the Union."
"Clearly, the primary responsibility for comprehensive cancer services lies with the Member States, but European action can make a difference."
"The Commission is currently preparing a report on the implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening of 2003."
"I expect that this will show that progress has been made, but that more still needs to be done."
"We will work with the Member States to pursue this."
"But even though screening is important, I think that Community action against cancer must cover a wider range of topics. For example: health information and data on the cancer burden that will highlight inequalities and best practices across Europe; preventative measures and health promotion on topics such as tobacco, nutrition and alcohol; best practices on treatment and integrated cancer care, such as palliative care; bringing together expertise through European reference networks; providing investment in infrastructure through the Structural Funds; and support for cancer research at Community level."
"I plan to bring forward proposals for an action plan on cancer next year."
"This will aim to provide focus and coherence for all these actions."
"We will also consider whether the scientific evidence justifies updating the existing recommendation on cancer screening."
"Some actions are already under way."
"We plan to include provisions for European reference networks as part of the forthcoming proposals on the application of patient rights in cross-border health care."
"The proposals later this year on rare diseases will also help to improve, inter alia, the situation regarding rare types of cancer."
"Moreover, when a person has cancer, it affects them most, but it also affects their family, their employer and society as a whole."
"My proposals will be accompanied by an impact assessment that will make clear not just the human cost of cancer but also the wider social and economic costs."
"I look forward to hearing your suggestions on issues we need to address as we develop those proposals."
"You may be sure that your proposals will be taken into account as we develop this action plan, and I count on your support for all our future actions."
"Mr President, firstly let me congratulate the Commissioner on taking up her duties."
"I welcome the views she has already expressed on cancer."
"Commissioner, I think it is time for us to adopt an effective strategy on cancer in line with current scientific and technological progress, so that the disease can stop being the main cause of death in Europe."
"Today, one third of all cancers are preventable."
"We must therefore review the existing preventive programmes and measures and create new ones to cover every eventuality."
"If we expand our scientific knowledge, we must review the Council's recommendation on early diagnosis and improve diagnostic methods for more types of cancers."
"In addition to breast, cervical and colorectal cancer, we must add skin cancer, and possibly lung and prostate cancer."
"Strengthening prevention and early diagnosis could cover nearly 70% of cases."
"For cases where prevention or early diagnosis is not possible, as you said, we need to improve therapeutic strategies and practice by being more effective and innovative."
"We must ensure that full use is made of the treatments provided by ever more successful innovation and research."
"It is necessary simply to incentivise research into innovative cancer treatments and to increase research funding."
"Naturally, bureaucratic formalities should not hinder research."
"Moreover, authorisation procedures should be reviewed in such a way that it becomes possible both to accelerate procedures for new drugs and to adhere to high standards of safety."
"Commissioner, this is all feasible today."
"The means made available by the EU may allow us in the immediate future to control cancer, thus almost freeing European citizens of this scourge."
"With steady focus on this goal, we are thus called upon today to move forward."
"We must do so, as you said, by drawing up the various composite elements of this strategy."
"We hope that both the European Commission and the Council will support Parliament's resolution and will take appropriate measures to achieve our targets."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, cancer affects one in three of us across the European Union and results in over one million deaths."
"Therefore this disease has a twofold cost: firstly, the human cost in terms of its impact on sufferers and their families and, secondly, as a major health burden to society as a whole."
"Further, due to the demographic changes we are experiencing, and with an ageing population, this is a problem that will only increase."
"We need to ensure that all our citizens have access to high-quality screening programmes, diagnosis and treatment, including palliative care."
"A cancer task force would ensure a cohesive and coordinated approach to all aspects of the disease, ensuring exchange of information and promotion of best practice."
"We must ensure that more is done to secure research and innovation, giving as many people as possible access to the best in cancer prevention and treatment."
"We also need to highlight the link between cancer and obesity - the most avoidable cause of cancer after tobacco."
"It is also vital to ensure that workers are protected from cancer-causing substances - around 8% of all cancers are caused by exposure to carcinogens at work - and we need binding limits on crystalline silica, which can cause disabling illness and fatal lung disease."
"On that point, I would urge Members to support paragraph 33 and recital K of the original text agreed by the committee - remember the construction industry is not party to the social partners' agreement on crystalline silica."
"There are massive disparities in cancer treatment and screening across Europe."
"Many of the deaths from cancer could be avoided by prevention measures, such as access to information and to comprehensive screening programmes."
"Tackling these disparities must be a priority."
"It is our moral duty and it is possible."
"What we need is the political will to achieve it."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would like to use this opportunity to thank the Slovenian Presidency for putting cancer so high on its political agenda."
"I want to highlight one initiative in particular: the European Cancer Patient Summit, which was held this week here in Brussels under the patronage of the Slovenian Presidency, with the participation of more than 150 patient groups from all over Europe."
"This very successful summit, where I also had the honour of addressing the audience, was the first event our new Commissioner for Health attended in this capacity."
"I must admit I was impressed by the Commissioner's speech and the commitment she expressed for the fight against cancer as a whole and the concerns of cancer patients in particular."
"I was also very happy to learn that the Commissioner intends to put forward a new cancer action plan, starting next year, to ensure that cancer remains high on the Commission's agenda."
"These initiatives from the Presidency and the Commission must encourage all of us to focus on what should be done, rethink what we have achieved and discover where the current deficits are."
"And now we are very much looking forward with high expectations to the upcoming Council conclusions on this topic."
"I am confident that these conclusions will provide a very good and solid basis for the following presidencies to continue along the lines set out therein."
"Therefore, I would like to strongly encourage the upcoming French Presidency to follow up on established initiatives and to keep cancer high on its agenda."
"Finally, I would like to thank all those colleagues who contributed very much in drafting the motion for a resolution on combating cancer in the enlarged European Union, on which we will vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, may I, too, add my congratulations."
"You are a cancer expert, since you were the director of an oncological centre before you came here as a Commissioner, so you must be used to what you are hearing now."
"I will not take issue with the statistical data that my fellow Members are giving you."
"Mr Trakatellis said that 30% of people can be saved by prevention."
"As an oncologist myself, I can assure you that a further 30% can be saved by reliable screening programmes."
"Yet how many of the 27 Member States have such programmes?"
"You must do something about this; coordination and hence assistance need to be assured."
"Perhaps you will also have to use funds from the Structural Funds and the 7th Framework Programme so that all these methods can contribute."
"You must help to raise the profile of oncology, since, as you have said, this is very important."
"The Slovenian Presidency is to be congratulated, but just as important is the creation of a task force wholly dedicated to the issue of cancer."
"(SK) Commissioner, I, too, would like to congratulate you on your nomination."
"It makes me very happy to see that the issue of cancer is being dealt with not only by experts but also by politicians, which is very important in this case."
"The experts are drawing our attention to alarming statistics and the trends in cancer occurrence are extremely unfavourable."
"Yesterday I was talking with patient organisations until lunchtime, and I can tell you that what they want is adequate treatment, which can be very demanding, especially in the case of rare types of cancer."
"There is still a huge gap between the 15 old and the 12 new Member States regarding the occurrence of this disease, its late diagnosis and the approach to its treatment at all stages of the disease."
"Insufficient prevention and late diagnosis or treatment aggravate the patients' state of health and their chances of getting better."
"Commissioner, please ensure that the fight against cancer is not just a priority during the six-month presidency, or for professional medical organisations such as ESMO or patient organisations."
"We, the Members of this Parliament, will also give you our support in the search for a solution."
"(SL) Commissioner, I did not expect to have the chance to talk to you about cancer three times in one week."
"I see that we have a Commissioner who knows how things are with cancer, and who will, together with us, put up a fight."
"Because knowing that health is the responsibility of member states, the European citizens wish certain tasks to be performed at European level, since it is only at this level that they can be performed properly."
"I am pleased that you have announced the action plan to fight cancer."
"We need it urgently, and if cancer has the exponential dynamics of epidemics, we too must have our own political dynamics, otherwise the gap and the consequences of cancer will become even more serious."
"I am pleased the Slovene Presidency has strengthened expectations that, in the future, activities will be more coordinated, there will be more continuity, and the initiatives will be more vigorous, and, as you yourself put it on another occasion earlier this week, that this will coincide with multi-partnerships."
"Moreover, I believe that it would be better if countries holding the EU presidency did not prioritise only single aspects, but continuously considered the entire frontline against cancer, as has already been mentioned today."
"In this spirit, I hope that with your help, a task group could be formed - or we could call it something else - to bring together the main institutions and key actors in the fight against cancer, not with the intention of creating a new bureaucracy, but in order to achieve better combined results owing to good methods of cooperation."
"Commissioner, I wish you much success in your work."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the media in my country are noting Germany's successful record on mammography screenings."
"Once again the EU guidelines on quality assurance have proved their worth."
"However, demands are already being made to offer this to younger women as well."
"This shows how important European guidelines are."
"Therefore, in its motion for a resolution, too, this House will tomorrow be calling for the further development of evidence-based EU guidelines on early detection, diagnosis and treatment of all widespread cancers and the formulation of an urgently needed accreditation and certification procedure for relevant facilities."
"Criteria on their own are not enough here."
"Only in this way will we manage to put quality above populism and above class and market interests when it comes to the early detection and treatment of cancer."
"I would ask all my fellow Members - and the Commissioner, too - to continue to persuade and bring on board the Member States still doubting the need for an accreditation procedure."
"Madam President, cancer is already the second biggest killer in Europe, but the reality is that many cancers are preventable and many cancer deaths unnecessary."
"Screening, diagnosis and treatment have improved but not enough."
"We must set up mechanisms at EU level to ensure that best practice is shared more effectively."
"Take colorectal cancer, for instance."
"It is estimated that over 27 000 lives could be saved in the EU each year if modern screening programmes were in place across Europe."
"We also need to make sure that those diagnosed with cancer are not discriminated against in the workplace."
"That should be covered by the Employment Directive 2000 on combating discrimination in the workplace, but many Member States do not class chronic illness and cancer as a disability."
"That is why we need a definition of disability at EU level that could include people with cancer."
"(GA) Madam President, I support the establishment of an interinstitutional taskforce on cancer that would allow representatives from the European Parliament, Commission and Council to meet on a regular basis."
"Research on cancer detection and prevention should also be funded under the seventh framework programme."
"I welcome the contribution made today to this debate by the Commission."
"Strategies which include women and, particularly, inexpensive and regular cervical screening and inexpensive and rapid breast screening must be implemented."
"We must also look at the effect of chemicals, which must be regulated through the REACH regulation."
"Finally, poverty is a key factor in ill health."
"Poor people are more likely to become ill and die at an earlier age than those who are more affluent."
"This is especially true in respect of cancer prevention and cure."
"(SK) I, too, want to welcome the fact that Mrs Vassiliou was today appointed the new Health Commissioner."
"I expect a lot from this new cooperation and, personally speaking, her presentation in the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety convinced me of her qualifications and her appetite for solving certain problems, for example those related to smoking, which is a subject dear to my heart."
"In this context, I would now like to concentrate on a similar topic."
"We know that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and that the most common diagnoses are lung cancer, bowel cancer (which some people have mentioned) and breast cancer."
"It is well known that lung cancer occurs up to five times more often than all other types of cancer combined."
"There is absolutely no doubt that passive smoking causes cancer just as active smoking does, and we also know that up to 95% of people who are diagnosed with lung cancer are smokers or passive smokers."
"Putting warnings on cigarette packets is not enough."
"It is time for adequate legislation to protect non-smokers to be introduced in the old and new Member States that are still putting if off, for reasons that are difficult to comprehend."
"In countries where good and sufficiently restrictive laws are in place, the health situation has improved significantly and billions have been saved instead of spent on cancer patient treatment."
"Ladies and gentlemen, articles recently published in professional medical literature point to a direct link between hormonal contraception and breast cancer."
"I want to ask the Commission and our programmes to allocate funds to research in this area, too, in order to reverse these trends and improve women's health."
"Madam President, cancer, as many know, is not necessarily an incurable disease."
"Modern treatment methodologies, along with early and more accurate diagnosis, mean that many forms of cancer are today eminently treatable with success."
"Of course, much remains to be done and this is why the EU must take it upon itself to declare an all-out war on cancer."
"We must fight this disease on all fronts, with strong aggression and endless determination."
"Our efforts must, for example, be directed at making sure that efficient screening programmes are in operation and implemented among those sections of the population that most need them."
"They must also be directed at ensuring that sufficient funding is always available to the research institutions that provide our hope for the future."
"Our citizens must be reassured that cancer can be defeated and we, in the European Parliament, are determined to continue to support this fight until, and unless, this is accomplished."
"In conclusion, let me take this opportunity to add my congratulations to the new Health Commissioner, Mrs Vassiliou."
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President, and greetings to the new Commissioner."
"Cancer is the second most common cause of death."
"In both 1993 and 2003, Hungary came first in the world in terms of cancer deaths, with the most common being lung, bowel and breast cancers."
"We know the causes: unhealthy diet, too little exercise, contraceptives, alcohol, smoking, and harmful environmental factors."
"We know that the most cost-effective way to combat cancer is prevention, and yet there are Member States, including Hungary for example, where this year money is only being put into screening programmes for mouth, breast and cervical cancers, but not other types of cancer."
"Patients have to wait six to eight weeks for CT and MRI scans and to commence treatment."
"I hope that this report will open the eyes of the Member States - including those of Hungarian politicians - and provide a boost to the current legislative debate on combating smoking. Thank you very much, and best wishes again to the Commissioner."
"(PL) Madam President, it is good that the Slovenian Presidency has taken up the fight against cancer as one of its priorities; but this cannot be a one-off action."
"The fight against cancer must be among the priorities of each successive presidency, if only because the incidence of this terrible disease in Europe is rising and will continue to rise as our society ages."
"I would like to draw attention to the inequalities emphasised by the Commissioner in the detection and treatment of cancer, which are so apparent when we compare the old and the new Union."
"Statistics point to a higher survival rate and lower mortality in the old EU, and I therefore appeal to the European Commission to apply special monitoring to the implementation of the EU programme 'Europe Against Cancer' in Central and Eastern Europe in particular."
"Citizens of the new Member States should enjoy the same conditions as citizens of the old Union as regards avoidance of this disease and, if they are already affected by it, fighting it."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to comment that prevention is the best way of combating cancer and that consequently our strict position regarding the marketing of carcinogenic substances and endocrine disruptors cannot be relaxed."
"I appeal to all my fellow Members who did not adopt the correct position in the first vote on pesticides."
"They could set things right in the second vote on the marketing of pesticides."
"As regards keeping national registries, I would like to point out to the Commissioner that this was suggested at the time of the vote on the Seventh Framework Programme two years ago, but was not retained."
"You will therefore have your work cut out, Commissioner, to encourage the Member States to accept this principle."
"Meanwhile, I congratulate you on your appointment and wish you luck."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"I too would like to say a few words about the importance of prevention."
"This debate has touched on the issue of smoking."
"Smoking is perhaps a good example of how social opposition can be generated; in many places nowadays smoking is not - if I can put it this way - a cool or trendy thing to be doing."
"At the same time, cancer has other causes that have not so far aroused healthy social opposition."
"Chemical contamination and air pollution are major causes of cancer."
"In the area of environmental protection, however, the kind of social awareness has not yet developed that would make us realise that certain chemicals must be taken out of our system, that excessive urban traffic is bad for city dwellers' health, or that reducing the amount of toxicants and pollution we are exposed to involves changing our whole lives."
"I would therefore like us all to realise just how closely interlinked the ideas of combating cancer, healthy lifestyle and protection of the environment are. Thank you."
"(PL) Madam President, thanks are due to the Slovenian Presidency for recognising the fight against cancer as one of its priorities for 2008."
"Sadly, in the European Union cancer reaps a harvest of one million lives each year."
"The numbers are shocking."
"During our lifetime, a tumour will be diagnosed in around 33% of people living in Europe, and for 25% it is the cause of death."
"The highest percentage of people dying of lung, prostate or breast cancer is recorded in the new Member States, i.e. in the poorest countries."
"Action needs to be taken at EU level to enable the disparities in oncological services to be ironed out, and especially where monitoring and screening are concerned."
"Let us not forget that early detection of cancer offers the best chance of curing it."
"It is estimated that one third of cases could be avoided by adopting a healthy lifestyle, not smoking tobacco or abusing alcohol, and participating in sport and keeping to a diet."
"(RO) I would also like to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency for introducing this theme and, obviously, Madame Commissioner for the opportunity to debate on this subject in her presence."
"I would like to emphasize the fact that it is important to have quality services for scanning, detecting and treating this disease."
"I also believe it is important to certify institutions with responsibilities in the field of oncological treatment and the Member States' governments should finance these institutions adequately."
"Last but not least, I emphasize the importance of the social integration of the ill; they should not consider themselves disabled and, for this reason, I believe the psychological condition of these patients could help them fight this disease."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I have followed with interest the discussion on cancer and I must say once again that cancer is not something which is temporarily on our agenda: it is something which is so serious for the whole of the European Union - and not only - that we cannot be complacent and it will always be among our priorities."
"I have been described as an expert on cancer."
"I must say that I am not an expert on cancer."
"There are people here who are really experts on cancer, but I am a person who has worked for many years in the fight against cancer and I will remain as such."
"I have heard very interesting comments."
"I will try to answer some of them, but rest assured that I have taken note of all the comments that were made, and we shall include them in our deliberations when we formulate our action plan."
"Concerning Structural Funds, the Commission has now included health as one of the priority areas for funding, so the funds can be used for health infrastructure, including cancer."
"Mention was made of carcinogens in the workplace."
"We already have strong European standards, as you know, on health and safety."
"The Commission will, of course, work to keep those standards updated as science updates our knowledge of risks."
"I will work on this with Commissioner Špidla, who is responsible for this area of legislation."
"The suggestion was made repeatedly concerning the setting-up of an interinstitutional task force to fight cancer."
"I would examine this during the deliberations of the forthcoming Health Council in Slovenia, and I would also make another addition to this suggestion: that I would like to see representatives of patients and of professionals included in this task force."
"Recognition of oncology as a specialisation is something that is, indeed, very necessary, but I would point out that this is something for the Member States to do."
"But, as far as I am concerned, I will exert all my influence in encouraging Member States to do so."
"Many speakers spoke about anti-smoking campaigns."
"We all know that smoking is one of the most serious detriments to health, and my intention is not only to continue the campaign against smoking but also to try to involve youth in this campaign, not only to make it less trendy for them but also to make them understand that it is to their benefit not to start smoking, and make them involved actively in the campaign so that the word is spread among young people, because that is the first stage to prevent smoking - to start with the young people."
"As I said, many other interesting proposals have been made."
"I will take all of them into consideration, and I will continue to work closely with Members of Parliament in reaching a very good action plan for next year."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) In accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion for a resolution on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to conclude this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the main points of the report in question."
"On one aspect, however, I believe we need to be clearer and more decisive: greater resources must be invested in research, in fact and not just in words, and researchers must be guaranteed better conditions."
"Important results have been achieved in the last few years, giving greater hope to those with cancer and their families, but there is still a long way to go."
"However, I think a more secular approach to the ethical issues would be desirable in each of the 27 Member States, because these often constitute a hindrance and constraint on research freedom."
"The priority objective, while complying with current laws, should be to stamp out this disease that in its varied and terrible forms continues to claim too many victims throughout Europe.<0 The task and duty of setting out on this path falls to us."
"in writing. - (SK) Although calling the number of cancer cases in the European Union an 'epidemic' is alarming, it is an appropriate term because cancer claims over 1 million lives a year."
"However, epidemics spread in those countries where the hygiene and epidemiology standards are not met and people live in poor conditions or do not have access to effective health care."
"I do not know which of these conditions the EU fulfils."
"We are talking about a cancer epidemic in the EU at the same time as we are talking about improving the economy and competitiveness, about massive investment in prevention, in new effective treatment methods and in the pharmaceutical industry."
"My country, the Slovak Republic, has for more than 30 years been running a national oncology programme to prevent cancer."
"In spite of that, cancer incidence rates continue to rise."
"Is this the doctors' fault or the patients' fault?"
"How are the EU funds for cancer prevention used?"
"In 2003 the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality prepared an own-initiative report on breast cancer."
"Although it accurately identified the causes and possible solutions, only a little of what was included in the report has been implemented."
"Sometimes I feel that the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and that our society, and the EU as a whole, deliberately keep quiet about the real reasons for this disease, perhaps in order to project a better image and for fear of telling the truth."
"Fighting cancer cannot be a priority for just one EU presidency."
"Its implementation as a systematic EU policy should already have been the norm for several years."
"Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (debate)"
"(FR) The next item is the report by Riitta Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Madam President, Commissioner Dimas, the targets under the Sixth Environment Action Programme are not going to be achieved as a result of the sort of environmental policy being implemented in the EU."
"The thematic strategies planned as the cornerstone of the Environment Action Programme and the legislation passed and largely now adopted based on them are insufficient to achieve the environmental targets."
"The decline in biodiversity is unlikely to be halted and legislation on the protection of the seas will not have any effect until 2012."
"Soil protection, as we know, has run into problems, not just in the Council but also here in Parliament."
"Legislation on waste is now on the home run, and it does not look good."
"We need to achieve satisfactory targets in the reduction in the volume of waste."
"Nor are the targets agreed in the air quality directive at the level agreed in the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"The targets in the Environment Programme are, however, being achieved in one area, and that is climate policy."
"That is the case especially when the measures which have now been agreed are actually implemented."
"We have to remember that the implementation of climate policy also helps when it comes to air quality and partly also waste, so in that respect it is very important."
"What then can we still do to get back on the road to achieving the targets in the Sixth Environment Action Programme?"
"First of all, Member States have to step up national implementation of EU legislation."
"The Commission must be given the necessary resources for it to be able to ensure that all Member States are attending to their obligations."
"Another big issue, and one which is perhaps the most important of them all, is how we manage to integrate the environment within all European Union legislation."
"We have spoken about this for years, but as yet nothing has been done in practice."
"We still have areas where we subsidise activity which is environmentally harmful."
"We must now do away with environmentally damaging subsidies, and Parliament should propose a timetable for this."
"Any policy that is environmentally favourable is to be recommended, including taxation measures."
"Unless legislation at European level can be used to develop eco-taxation, we will have to employ the means available to us, for example, flexible cooperation, using that to take tax matters forward."
"If the state of the environment is to be improved, binding legislation still needs to be a priority."
"I would like to thank all the groups who took part in this work, and I wish to say that I have tabled a few amendments solely with the purpose of clarifying the text and make its tone more balanced."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a Europe of results is a priority for the Commission."
"Our environmental policy has been - and is - a very successful EU policy, since it has offered its citizens clear and tangible benefits."
"Around 80% of the Member States' environmental legislation is based on corresponding EU legislation."
"The latter has made a vital contribution to major improvements in air and water quality, as well as to the protection and maintenance of Europe's natural resources."
"The EU is thus able to play a leading international role in issues such as climate change, biodiversity and legislation on chemical products."
"Nearly a year has passed since the Commission published its Communication on the Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme."
"Last year was particularly important, since environmental issues were constantly to at the top of the EU's list of political priorities."
"Over this period we have wholly fulfilled our political commitments."
"Let me give you three examples of this."
"At the Bali Summit last December, a procedure was launched to achieve a new agreement on global climate until the end of 2009."
"The EU's 'green diplomacy' was largely instrumental in achieving this positive result."
"The package of proposals on climate and energy produced by the Commission in January was ambitious and demonstrated the EU's continuing commitment to setting a global example."
"The proposed new directive on industrial emissions strengthens the provisions already in force and simplifies existing legislation merging seven different directives, on integrated pollution prevention and control."
"Thus our legislation has become easier to implement and we are contributing towards making it more environmentally effective."
"In the past year important progress was made."
"One of the main messages of the mid-term review - that the long-term viability of the European economy needs to be based on sound environmental principles - was largely accepted by industry."
"The high standards set by EU environmental legislation encourage ecological innovation, which in turn boosts industrial productivity and creates new employment."
"In other words, the ambitious environmental goals are both improving European citizens' quality of life and central to achieving our goals in economic development and employment."
"These positive developments contradict scientific evidence that Europe has not yet entered a phase of sustainable development."
"In fact, we are only half-way through the time period covered by the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, so there is obviously plenty more to be done in tackling the current and emerging threats to our environment."
"In the coming months the Commission will produce new proposals, many of which are included in Parliament's report."
"These initiatives include the review of the directive on national emissions ceilings, and a package of proposals in the area of sustainable consumption and production."
"We are also preparing a legislative proposal on restricting timber trafficking from illegal logging."
"After the summer, communications will be ready concerning the European view on the issue of halting deforestation and on finding ways of recording companies' results using criteria that go further than GDP."
"We are also preparing a proposal to prohibit trade in the skins of seals that have been inhumanely hunted."
"Improved implementation of Community legislation is a major priority; it is the key to creating a better environment."
"Only by ensuring the correct implementation of the acquis communautaire in its entirety can the goals of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme possibly be achieved."
"Effective implementation is connected with better legislation."
"I can now express my satisfaction because in the last two years the Commission has been able to disassociate better legislation from lower environmental standards."
"The truth is that the older and simpler legislation is one of the better ways of improving the implementation of the new rules and can thus contribute to better environmental protection."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am especially pleased that in your report there are constructive conclusions on the way in which Europe can successfully create a better environment and genuine sustainable development."
"I assure you that the Commission will examine these conclusions with great care when analysing areas where it can see policy gaps and when setting out priorities for the coming years."
"Let me thank the rapporteur, Mrs Myller, for her efforts and likewise Mr Karim, Mrs Jeleva and Mr Navarro from the Committee on International Trade, the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their excellent recommendations."
"It is obvious that there is broad agreement as regards the way forward."
"It now remains for us to transform this support policy into concrete action to ensure a better environment from 2012 onwards."
"on behalf of the PSE group. - (HU) In terms of the goals set out in the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, we are lagging behind in many regards."
"I would like to mention just two of these here."
"The air in our cities is polluted and unhealthy."
"In the absence of Community legislation, in many cities achieving the goals set out in the thematic strategy on the urban environment seems a very long way off."
"The Commission must therefore put forward legislation that clearly defines a framework for the urban environment and urban transport in the whole of the European Union, as otherwise our citizens will continue to suffer from poor air quality and other forms of pollution."
"Similarly, implementation of the Water Framework Directive keeps stalling."
"If legislation on industry does not accord with policies on agriculture and rural development, then our water resources will continue to be polluted."
"As demonstrated by the foam on the River Raba in Hungary resulting from pollution by Austrian leather manufacturers, current legislation is not able to prevent contamination of water resources."
"The Member States and the Commission must do everything in their power to ensure universal compliance with the Water Framework Directive and the Floods Directive. Thank you."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, many thanks to Riitta Myller for her excellent report and for her cooperation."
"As the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety says, the implementation of the EU's Environment Programme is in many respects late, but what is even more startling is that, even if all the concrete targets set thus far were fully achieved, the EU would still not be on the road to sustainable development."
"For example, we probably will not manage to halt the decline in biodiversity by 2010, even if we are committed to doing so."
"The unpleasant truth is that our society is constructed to work in a way that is unsustainable."
"If everyone on earth consumed resources the way Europeans do, we would need four earths to produce the necessary resources."
"If the middle classes of China, India and other developing countries copy our consumption habits the planet will be in crisis."
"I hope that the wake-up call that is now on its way thanks to climate policy will result in a more comprehensive reassessment of our lifestyle and production habits."
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"Let me begin by saying that I, too, disagree that implementation of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme is going according to plan."
"Moreover, in many cases concrete quantitative and qualitative targets and timetables are lacking, not only in the Action Programme, but also in the thematic strategies."
"There is no doubt that implementation of the Sixth Action Programme is behind schedule; we have not yet managed to meet the priority environmental objectives set out in the Programme, and implementation of the legislation in the Member States keeps stalling."
"Let me give you a concrete example."
"First: no concrete steps have been taken to draft legislation concerning indoor air quality."
"A particular priority in this regard is the drafting of provisions relating to schools and other public indoor spaces used by vulnerable groups."
"At the very least, pilot projects should be initiated."
"Second: implementation of directives on the Natura 2000 networking programme has also stalled."
"Best practice needs to be disseminated, and fiscal measures put in place against polluters."
"I myself have approached the Commission with a submission relating to contamination of Natura 2000 areas, but the Commission has merely been sitting on its hands and has not taken any action."
"Third: illegal dumping of hazardous and municipal waste in the territory of other countries has proliferated in recent times."
"Africa and Asia are often the destination of European waste, and this is unacceptable."
"Equally unacceptable is the fact that several German Länder are illegally transporting many thousands of tonnes of waste to eastern Europe, and then refuse to take it back - take the case of Bavaria, for example."
"Fourth: whatever happened to the fine principle of preventing cross-border pollution?"
"One Member State, Austria, has been polluting the River Raba for the past seven years, as Mr Hegyi mentioned earlier."
"Thick foam floats on the surface of the river."
"I have raised this issue at least half a dozen times already, and indeed I have also made a formal complaint, but to no avail: the foam on the river remains, while the Commission sits there doing nothing."
"Fine principles are meaningless unless they are implemented."
"The Commission is the guardian of European Union law."
"It is time for this guardian to do its duty and not give in to Member States, but instead to ensure compliance with the laws that we have jointly adopted. Thank you very much."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"I think it reflects Parliament's concerns about how much the Union has so far abided by its commitments within the framework of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme."
"The Commission's mid-term review reveals that coordinated efforts are required to plug the gaps in legislation with new legislative proposals."
"It is also necessary to secure the requisite resources to ensure proper implementation of Community legislation."
"Meanwhile, it is becoming understood that a greater reliance has to be placed on a sustainable model of production and consumption, and that economic growth must become more dependent on natural resources."
"It is just as important to emphasise the international dimension of European environmental policy."
"The Union must be encouraged to continue promoting ambitious environmental policies and requirements, and to develop technology transfer and the exchange of good practice with developing countries."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I really do not think that the document that we are considering is what it could be, and I will explain: it is a document to assess what has been done with the broad guidelines that the European Commission had proposed for the environment, and for all environmental policy."
"I do not think that it is an assessment document."
"It is not a detailed assessment document that could have helped us to plan for the future, perhaps because the Commission is not accustomed to being judged or assessed, nor does it vote, or have a group of shareholders that demand results from it."
"I do think, however, although it may appear to be a contradiction, that the Commission can be congratulated on the results that it has had in recent years, but not on the document."
"I think that environmental policy has been absolutely integrated into municipal and regional policies, and industry itself is responding to the European Union guidelines."
"However, the document lacks a projection of how we need to change for the future, because those points where the system has not worked well need to be reviewed."
"Europe has been making environmental policy for more than 25 years and it needs to review some of its methods, because this is not the only thing that explains the failure of some policies."
"I do not see any examination of how we can change the ways that we involve the regions and create networks, whether or not these are EU dominated in attitude."
"There are now many countries, as happened with the Soil Directive, that already have much better regulations than Europe can give them and others that do not have any."
"In response to this imbalance, Europe needs to take different positions and look for new ways of working, because it is logical that, if the world has changed, we should change our working methods."
"Thank you very much, congratulations on the results but let us change in the future."
"(SK) In my opinion, it is very important that the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme has brought to light an important fact: implementation of this programme is running well behind the planned schedule."
"As a result, the likelihood that everything will be done by 2012 and that the priority goals will be met is rather low."
"I share the opinion that clearer and more tangible quantitative and qualitative goals still need to be incorporated into the programme."
"I also agree that the submission of thematic strategies has not generated effective results."
"For this reason, I would stress the need for further efforts to eliminate loopholes in environmental laws by means of new legislative proposals."
"It is also very important to ensure the effective implementation of environmental regulations."
"Climate change, biodiversity, health and resource use will continue to be among our most urgent challenges for the future."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should carry out these evaluations from time to time, and in particular publish the findings from the Member States in a register, as conflicts do occur on the individual issues, of course, over the years, for example in the case of the Water Framework Directive, where we are going to great lengths on the one hand to promote renewable energy, but on the other hand are wasting unused water."
"There are also problems with Natura 2000."
"We should be listening to citizens here and adapting the programmes accordingly from time to time."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first mention the excellent comments that have been made tonight."
"The Commission will of course take these into account and put them to good use accordingly."
"In its mid-term review, the Commission came to the conclusion that the EU was generally on the right track as regards fulfilling the measures set out in the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"If we continue to make progress in these crucial years, we shall be able to carry out the proposals contained in the programme up to 2012."
"The preparation of the proposals, however, and even their adoption and approval, account for only half of the work required."
"As has been pointed out tonight, without effective implementation of environmental policy, we will certainly not reach the environmental targets set in the Sixth Environment Action Programme, however well the legislation may have been prepared by the European institutions."
"For precisely this reason, I fully share Parliament's view that greater efforts are needed and sufficient resources must be made available to the Commission to enable us to continue to deal properly with implementation issues."
"This will allow the Commission to help national authorities to develop those capacities necessary to achieve the results we are aiming for."
"The Commission also shares Parliament's view that it is vitally important to incorporate environmental issues into other policies."
"As the report makes clear, this integration is crucial in trade policies, since the EU has highly significant economic relations with other countries of the world, and trade has an obvious environmental impact."
"It is just as important, however, that environmental issues be incorporated into agricultural, regional and transport policy: if the essential funding is provided, Community policies will have a significant effect on the regions of Europe."
"The impact study procedure, also established by the Commission, aims to improve the cohesion of Community policies and includes an assessment of all the environmental parameters of our proposals."
"The Commission would like the European Parliament's support so that a full assessment of all environmental aspects can be guaranteed during the consideration of proposals by other institutions as well."
"Finally, the report highlights the key role of the national, regional and local authorities, as well as of citizens, consumers and businessmen, in attaining the environmental targets set in the EU's Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"I assure you that the Commission will do everything it can to raise the programme's profile and to secure the support of the parties concerned."
"I am sure that Parliament will assist in these efforts and I hope that the protection of the European environment will be one of the main issues of concern to voters in next year's elections."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Madam President, I wish to thank everyone who took part in the debate and the Commissioner."
"Parliament and I, as rapporteur, are actually aiming at a situation where the Commission acquires new instruments to get environmental policy on a path which leads to the targets under the Sixth Environment Action Programme being attained."
"In its mid-term report the Commission said it was its opinion, just as Commissioner Dimas remarked, that the means cited in the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme would be enough to achieve this, but a study which has been undertaken on the Commission's current policy indicates otherwise."
"This report, which hopefully will be adopted tomorrow with a large majority, indicates areas where improvements are still needed at European level, and it mentions very largely the same remedies as those proposed in the Commissioner's speech."
"In other words, we are of the same opinion as to what needs to be done, but, as Mrs Hassi said here, whether or not the means proposed are generally adequate to get the European Union on the road to sustainable development we shall certainly have to have very frank discussions together."
"We are now on the right path with regard to climate policy."
"If we establish such ambitious policies in the other areas, then surely we will succeed."
"I said I had tabled a few amendments in order to clarify this report."
"I would just like to mention that that the Finnish in Amendment 14 is very odd: the English text should be used as a reference."
"(FR) The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written declarations (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I think it would be a good thing if we were to accept the Sixth Environment Action Programme according to Article 251 of the EC Treaty, i.e. through a codecision procedure."
"Protecting the environment is a matter of exceptional importance for the EP, which, after all, represents some 500 million Europeans."
"Including the EP in the codecision procedure distinctly demonstrates the role it has."
"The 10 year operating period of the Sixth Action Programme requires regular evaluations, especially as regards its priorities."
"It is true that the thematic strategies included in the programme have improved the participation of stakeholders and developed the dimension of environmental policy, but at the same time they have delayed or prolonged the process of law-making in this sphere."
"A disgraceful example has been set by the unfinished air quality directive."
"Parliament has rightly commented that the greatest progress has been made in those subsections of the Programme concerning which no separate thematic strategies (e.g. climate change) were drafted."
"On the other hand, though, we should bear in mind that the Sixth Action Programme urges us to support sustainable production methods and consumption models by fiscal means."
"Although it is difficult to see this mid-term review as highly satisfactory, it is nevertheless the only mechanism through which the EU can effectively push for achievement of the goals set."
"A lack of achievement in this area would damage the credibility of the EU and of its Members who are genuinely concerned about the deteriorating state of the environment."
"in writing. - (RO) The Commission Communication regarding the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (EAP) confirms the fact that climate change, loss of biodiversity, health and use of resources represent the most pressing environmental challenges and, for this reason, it is essential for this programme to become an important instrument in the strategy for sustainable EU development."
"Taking into consideration the measures implemented so far by this programme, it is improbable for the priority environmental objectives to be achieved by 2012."
"For instance, the objective of stopping the loss of biodiversity by 2010 cannot be achieved, and the strategies proposed for protecting the marine environment and the soil will give no concrete results by 2012."
"At the same time, the actions taken to improve air quality, as well as those set in the Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution and the objectives regarding ambient noise reduction are not enough to achieve the EAP objectives."
"Neither the settlement of problems, nor the reticence of certain Member States toward the implementation of directives regarding the habitats and Natura 2000 are dealt adequately with in the Commission communication."
"Once the N2000 sites are designated, it is necessary to formulate, promote and monitor the conservation objectives."
"This review calls attention to these problems and requests the Commission to aim at ambitious results in the field of environmental protection."
"Eurostars (debate)"
"(FR) The next item is the report by Paul Rübig, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on support for research and development performing SMEs - C6-0281/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, today we are dealing with the Commission proposal to support the Eurostars Joint Programme, and I thank you for giving me a few minutes to explain the key features and the importance of this initiative."
"The Eurostars Joint Programme aims to support research and development performing SMEs."
"These SMEs are able to bring new products and services onto the market thanks to their own research and development work."
"They have the ambition and the capacity to grow and to become the 'stars' of tomorrow."
"A group of 29 EUREKA countries, and now Luxembourg, which has just applied to join, have decided to develop the Joint Programme, specifically designed to support SMEs undertaking their own research and development activities, in cooperation with their partners."
"In order to enhance the impact of this initiative, the Commission has proposed to the European Parliament and the Council participating financially in the Eurostars Joint Programme, based on Article 169 of the Treaty, with an amount of up to EUR 100 million."
"This amount will leverage approximately EUR 300 million from the participating countries for the next six years."
"An essential aspect of this initiative is that the participating countries commit themselves to integrate their national programmes in order to create a joint European programme."
"In addition, Eurostars reinforces the cooperation between the Framework Programme and EUREKA."
"For these reasons, I think that this initiative is a further step towards the realisation of the European Research Area."
"I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Rübig, and also to the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for the good cooperation and the improvements they are proposing to the Commission proposal."
"On behalf of the Commission, I can inform you that we accept these proposals."
"I particularly appreciate the fact that you agreed to handle this proposal swiftly, so that we will be able to contribute to the first Eurostars call."
"A rapid adoption by Parliament and the Council would indeed send a strong signal to the SME community that a continued investment in research and innovation activities is crucial to maintain and enhance their competitiveness."
"Eurostars should be a good example of how Member States can cooperate by bringing their national programmes closer together, and of where Community funding results in more impact for the programme, for the benefit of the European SME community and, of course, for the benefit of Europe as such."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Slovenian Presidency, too, as it has done everything it can right up until the last minute to ensure that this programme is able to be implemented on time."
"I should also like to thank all my fellow Members, of course, because we have demonstrated once again here how effective European legislation can actually be."
"When you think that the report was only introduced in January and that tomorrow we shall be voting on it, then you see that this House, the Presidency and the Commission are able to work together very effectively."
"We can be extremely proud of this."
"I should also like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as it is not easy to negotiate a relatively complex matter in such a short space of time, to prepare and implement the basic principles accordingly."
"We are very happy that Slovakia, the United Kingdom and - at the last minute - Luxemburg, which we did not know about until yesterday, have expressed a wish to join this programme in recent weeks."
"I shall also be tabling an oral amendment on this tomorrow, and I would ask the Presidency that Luxembourg therefore be considered tomorrow when the Member States are named, so that small and medium-sized enterprises in Luxemburg, too, are able to take part in this programme successfully."
"During the negotiations, we in Parliament have been emphasising a transparent and above all unbureaucratic, but efficient programme for promoting research."
"This should also, in particular, make possible our very earnest wish for one-off payments to be made and quick decisions taken, so that enterprises raise the funds needed to carry out research activities and do not take out a bank loan in advance, and then often have to wait a very long time for the money."
"I believe, Commissioner Potočnik, that this programme is a sign of better regulation, that we have really succeeded here in implementing the objectives concerning SMEs and better regulation under the Seventh Framework Research Programme appropriately."
"Participation and management by Eureka is also exemplary, as Eureka is able to make very efficient and rapid decisions on this as well as ultimately bearing a large share of the responsibility."
"The Community ultimately provides up to one third of the support."
"Commissioner, as you have already said, we are talking about up to EUR 100 million."
"New to the programme is also the fact that this is a genuine bottom-up programme, and therefore comes from the business community, from the small, research-intensive or medium-sized enterprises."
"I am actually proud of the fact that the Eurostat Secretariat in Brussels is operating on the market here very efficiently and very quickly in close cooperation with the national funding agencies, and that it is therefore also becoming possible to focus on market-oriented research activities aiming at short- and medium-term commercial results."
"This is a key element of the work of small and medium-sized enterprises, and it should be cost-effective."
"High costs should not be incurred in the process for either the enterprises or the authorities; instead, everything should be clearly and coherently worded in order that each individual enterprise is also able to respond to the questions asked as part of its activities without a huge outlay."
"We have recently checked this. It has been a great success."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Madam President, I would first like to congratulate our rapporteur, Paul Rübig, on his report and I would like to thank him for having agreed to present an oral amendment to include Luxembourg in this programme and to thereby remedy the administrative dawdling that caused its absence."
"We have known, Commissioner, at least since the first evaluation report on the Lisbon process, that SMEs play an essential role in the field of research and innovation."
"However, their level of participation is not yet meet expectations and the latest investment figures are proof of this."
"This special programme should therefore facilitate the participation of SMEs, and also reduce any excessive bureaucracy."
"In fact, in some ways it is a matter of setting things straight, covering the risk and counteracting the hesitancy of companies when it comes to investing in research and innovation, which is perhaps also an evil of the European corporate mindset."
"I congratulate our rapporteur for insisting on adoption at the first reading, which should accelerate the implementation of this programme, guarantee its effectiveness and prove that European legislation is perhaps not as cumbersome as people sometimes accuse it of being, but that it can act effectively in the interest of citizens."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Thank you, Madam President."
"Commissioner, thank you for attending this debate."
"I would also firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work."
"For some time now, in various forums and also in Parliament, the possible relationship between the Community Framework Programme and the EUREKA intergovernmental programme has been the subject of analysis and debate, as both involve considerable aid to SMEs."
"The result of these synergies has been Community funding for the Eurostars programme, on the basis of Article 169 of the Treaty, a programme that complements the Framework Programme through what I understand to be the main virtues of EUREKA: its bottom-up structure, which enables better adaptation to the needs of SMEs and facilitates participation, given that the bureaucracy required in order to participate in the Framework Programme is, in many cases, an excessive burden that is impossible for many SMEs to bear."
"Supporting greater integration of SMEs into R&D is something that Parliament has always advocated, and Eurostars can have a considerable mobilising impact."
"We therefore especially welcome this initiative."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, Mr Rübig has - as usual - presented an excellent report. Congratulations to him."
"This is a very important subject, since the introduction of research results into industrial and business practice may be relatively promptly facilitated via SMEs."
"This is a fundamental aspect of the Lisbon Strategy."
"It is consequently a good thing that the Eurostars programme builds on the 7th Framework Programme for transnational enterprises and finances work in the sphere of science and technology put into effect by SMEs in cooperation with higher education institutions, research entities and other companies - large ones."
"The direction of research is also important; it should be pro-market and have practical applications that are as prompt as possible."
"This good idea, which supports business initiatives and should be free of bureaucracy and clear, including its financial aspects."
"This is important for all partners, especially for business people."
"The success of this programme will set a good example for the future."
"Let us hope that our one hundred million euros are not wasted."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Small and medium-sized enterprises provide 70% of jobs in the European Union."
"That said, these enterprises invest only 4% in science, research and technological development, which is without any doubt the reason why they do not make better use of their business potential."
"We need to develop the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises within the framework of the renewed Lisbon Strategy."
"There are several ways to do this: give them better access to information, offer them better credit conditions, enable them to cooperate better with the public sector and help them to improve ties with large businesses so that both small and big systems are mutually linked."
"I think that this is feasible and can be achieved in a relatively short period of time."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, the EU extends its reach into more and more areas."
"The problem is that there is no principle for deciding what the EU should do."
"A sound principle is the one paid lip-service in policy speeches but ignored in decision-making: the subsidiarity principle."
"That argues against centralising research and development, except as regards very large-scale projects on the lines of Galileo or fusion energy."
"Research and development bureaucratised in large organisations gives less return on the money put in, not more."
"There is seldom any reason for Member States to send money to Brussels and then have their researchers ask for it back later."
"This assessment is particularly valid when it comes to research and development for small and medium-sized businesses."
"The enthusiasm shown by researchers and businesses comes from the fact that they are conned into thinking that more funds will be available overall."
"There is nothing to indicate that this is the case."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(SK) First of all, allow me to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on this report."
"I think that thanks mainly to Mr Rübig this Parliament has managed to find a compromise that is acceptable to both the Commission and the Council and should result in adoption of this proposal at first reading."
"I believe that the EUREKA initiative concerning a research and development programme for small and medium-sized enterprises is very much welcomed by the business community."
"The fact that so many countries participate in this initiative confirms that prior to this programme there had been a lack of interest in solving the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In spite of the European Parliament's efforts, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development has not solved the problem of how SMEs approach the funds provided to support their research, development and innovation activities either."
"It is thus extremely encouraging to see that this bottom-up initiative has met with so much approval in all the relevant European institutions."
"Although there is no doubt that some progress has been made, the fact is that some questions still remain unanswered."
"I am thinking here of the eligibility criteria for the SMEs, in particular the proportion of time and annual turnover dedicated to research activities."
"Personally, I am of the opinion that when setting these criteria we should be more broadminded and consider opening the Eurostars programme up to smaller enterprises with substantial innovation and development potential in spite of their size."
"In conclusion I want to say how pleased I am that my country, Slovakia, is also involved in the cooperation: this should improve the situation of small and medium-sized innovative enterprises whose development has to some extent been lagging behind until now."
"(RO) First of all, I congratulate Rapporteur Rübig and I would like to specify certain elements."
"For the economic competitiveness of the European Union, it is essential to support small and medium-sized enterprises investing in applied research."
"The 22 Member States and the 5 states in Eureka that have decided to invest, together with the Commission, the 400 million euros to support the research carried out by small businesses, contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon Strategy objectives."
"We should not forget that the SMEs represent 99% of the total European enterprises."
"The selection of projects to be financed by the Eurostars programme shall be made according to the scientific excellence and economic impact."
"Nevertheless, I call attention to the difficulty that small and medium-sized enterprises meet in ensuring the co-financing of 50% of a project's value."
"Many of the small enterprises would rather assign their specialists to projects bringing rapid income, to the detriment of long-term research programmes."
"Also, the financing of small businesses based on a business plan might determine a very large number of SMEs participating in the European research."
"I hope that, during this programme, the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs will also continue."
"(PT) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is extremely important to support small and medium-sized enterprises as well as to stimulate their scientific and technological development."
"SMEs need a solid technological base to enable them to boost their contribution to economic growth and development."
"As a rule SMEs have a great capacity for initiative and adaptability since they are not stifled by bureaucracy and are normally run by entrepreneurs and managers who are highly committed to their work of wealth creation."
"That capacity for initiative and adaptability makes it easier to launch new business ventures involving the manufacture and/or sale of new products or the operation of new services tailored to the needs of consumers or other businesses."
"Such new products and services could frequently require a more solid technological base than is available in many such small enterprises, therefore the Eurostars joint research and development programme aimed at supporting SMEs could be very important because of its potential impact on the 'real economy'."
"It will thus help to improve the skills of small and medium-sized enterprises in various European States, serving citizens as consumers as well as the European economy."
"It will thus also help to create more and better jobs."
"For all those reasons Mr Rübig's report has been most useful."
"(RO) First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Rübig for the correct and rapid way in which he managed this report."
"This report creates a premise for a new approach of the Lisbon Strategy by simply relating research to SMEs."
"Thus, we give a new value to competitiveness and a new boost to start-ups, SMEs with innovative activity."
"Eurostars should become the starting point for relaunching the European economic activity, a programme of European innovative stars, a transparent, flexible and non-bureaucratic programme."
"I end by requesting the Commission, together with all the states participating in this programme, to encourage and promote this programme closely related to the European priority themes: climate change, energy efficiency, promoting renewable energy resources and, last but not least, the fight against cancer."
"(SK) The Eurostars joint research and development programme supports research and development-performing SMEs in executing market-oriented research in transnational projects, implemented on behalf of various SME associations."
"I would like to stress in particular the importance of the transfer of knowledge and the need for cooperation within the framework of this programme between enterprises themselves and with other institutions, based on industrial and economic partnerships."
"The fact that this is a bottom-up programme, directly adapted to the needs of research-performing enterprises that participate in it, is a very positive aspect."
"The key issue is that the research activities are market-oriented and aimed at short to medium-term commercial results."
"I also want to mention a new feature of this programme: namely the introduction of the Risk Sharing Finance Facility designed for more risky RTD projects."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"I, too, would like to congratulate Mr Potočnik and Mr Rübig."
"The Eurostars Joint Programme is an excellent means of achieving the Lisbon goals, of enhancing competitiveness, and of strengthening innovation."
"Research and development SMEs that spend at least 10% of their turnover on research and development are key players in this domain."
"Hungary is a member of this programme, and interest in it has been enormous."
"More than 200 businesses fulfilling the criteria have applied, although a problem now emerging is that Member States have not set aside adequate resources."
"In Hungary, for example, only EUR 500 000 are available, sufficient for only 2-3 projects."
"Consequently, I think the Member States should at all events increase the resources allocated for this, or try to spend at least 3% of GDP on research and development so that we can be competitive at world-class level too."
"I believe that Eurostars and EUREKA are the kind of programmes that provide an excellent means of achieving this."
"Congratulations again."
"(PL) Mr President, simply put, it pays to invest in small businesses."
"Scientific studies have shown that small businesses with simple technologies have room for good innovations, and I would very much like to emphasise this."
"This is also the case with family firms, in which investment is made in one child in the given firm's line, so there is a certain continuity, and I consider this to be a very sound way of going on."
"Moreover, these firms are highly flexible, and for a small outlay are capable of moving from one place to another, and also from one product to another;"
"I believe, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that if more than 60% of income in the EU comes from SMEs, it would be a major error on our part to skimp on investment in them and their development."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking everybody not only for supporting the proposal in the report but also, and even more, for supporting the SMEs."
"SMEs are a vital part of the European economy and here, as I have already said, in the Eurostars programme we are talking about SMEs which will be the 'stars' of the future."
"This is an innovative approach."
"It is not easy to implement approaches where we combine money from the Member States with Community funding, but it is definitely worthwhile, because that is exactly the direction in which we should go in the future."
"We are joining the best of EUREKA - flexibility, simplicity, decentralised approach, market orientation - with the best of the Framework Programme: centralised management, common evaluation and common selection."
"I can assure you that also in the other parts of the Framework Programme we are keeping our eyes very much open for the benefit of the SMEs."
"Simplification is the name of the game, so we have introduced, as you are probably aware, a higher funding rate for SMEs than for the rest."
"So they have a 75% co-funding rate in the Framework Programme, while the rest of the bigger companies have 50%, which means that we are stimulating their participation."
"We have introduced a guarantee fund, which very much simplifies their participation in the Framework Programme, because the fact that they have to submit some bank guarantees in advance was one of the major problems for SMEs; and we are also about to introduce a 'unique registration facility' which will again ease the job because you will have to apply only once and all your data will be stored and the next time you apply this will be done automatically."
"Therefore, if we look at the results of the first year - and as you know, we agreed about the target of 15% funding which should go to SMEs from the cooperation part of the programme - we can say that it is working."
"While in Framework Programme 6 we were not achieving the target, from the first evaluations and first insight into the results, we can see that this figure is closer to 20% than 15%, which is a major step forward."
"We are also working in the Commission."
"I have just come from a meeting of the competitiveness group where we discussed the Small Business Act - that is the working title - where we want to address all the issues connected with SMEs in an organised way."
"I would also like to mention that, although today we are deciding about financial participation from the Community side, in fact this has already begun, and more than 200 have applied for the first call, which is an important success."
"Finally, I should like to mention that I am extremely glad that Luxembourg has decided to join."
"There is definitely no problem in substance."
"We should all do our best to make its accession to the programme as quick as possible."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Potočnik, ladies and gentlemen, in summary we can say that we have again set ourselves an objective here that focuses on the Lisbon Agenda."
"Implementation of research results in the short-term will, we hope, create new jobs and lead to higher net wages."
"Of course, an essential feature of innovation is that new products are offered, and thus also success is achieved on the market."
"I am also pleased that, together with the European Investment Bank, we have succeeded in providing an additional instrument for risk sharing, and that these sums can therefore be spread significantly further."
"We have also devised an evaluation in order to see whether the funds are actually being claimed and check that the European Parliament is not having to make cutbacks again on account of the funds not being completely exhausted in the previous year, as happens with other programmes."
"I believe this programme can ensure that the funds are exhausted, and I would ask my fellow Members to ensure in the Member States, too, that cofinancing works as intended."
"It is in the interest of all of us that the take-up of this programme be good. I believe that it should also be communicated accordingly."
"I would also ask Commissioner Potočnik to arrange with Commission Vice-President Wallström for this programme to be presented to the public as exemplary: this is part of the process."
"I should like once again to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency: this is a product and a project that is really worth showing off."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (DE) Commissioner Potočnik, talking about the role of SMEs is the done thing in this House."
"Indeed, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the EU economy."
"In Germany alone, almost 20 million people are working, researching and developing in more than 3.3 million small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Whether Europe grows or stagnates mainly depends on them."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises produce more patents, innovations and jobs than the large conglomerates. Yet the SMEs continue to have too little access to loans and funding programmes."
"Eurostars is a good example of how things work."
"Unlike the Seventh Framework Programme, which is based on a top-down approach with central funding by the EU, Eureka and Eurostars are bottom-up approaches."
"The programmes are managed by the Eureka Initiative."
"This is a good thing, and could also perhaps be a model for our Seventh Framework Programme."
"The advantages of the Eurostars programme are as follows:"
"• research-intensive SME required in leadership role"
"• eligibility checking and evaluation by international experts"
"• harmonised invitations to tender and workflows in all Member States"
"• fast decision making regarding funding: 14 weeks after the cut-off date"
"• the Commission awards additional top-up"
"• funding exclusively in the form of non-repayable grants (cash allowance)"
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on his work."
"I wish the programme every success."
"in writing. - (SK) By voting for Paul Rübig's report, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises can often be effective participants in research and development but they have to put up with less favourable conditions than those that apply to large international corporations."
"From now on, SME associations performing research and development can avail of financial support from Europe and operate within a European network together with other small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Slovak SMEs will thus be able to contribute their knowledge and capacities to the European research and development sector."
"In Slovakia many small and medium-sized enterprises are located in rural areas with less developed infrastructure, which hampers their development."
"Many women are employed in research and development performing SMEs, whether directly or indirectly."
"European funds are useful because they give SMEs a start, thus allowing their professional capacities to serve the common interest."
"The Eurostars programme is a programme for researching and developing new products and services at European Union level."
"SMEs play a key role in Eurostars projects."
"It is a real pity that the Slovak Republic, an EU Member State, does not participate in this programme."
"Slovakia's small and medium-sized enterprises consequently have no access to the significant financial support available for the effective development of new products, techniques and services."
"Research Fund for Coal and Steel (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Adam Gierek, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel - C6-0248/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first and foremost, I wish to express my gratitude to the European Parliament, and particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Gierek, for the interest and support shown regarding the Research Fund for Coal and Steel."
"Let me also thank the chairwoman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Ms Niebler, and the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Laperrouze and Mr Březina, for their constructive help."
"I understand that the request for a debate was made by a number of members of the ITRE Committee. I am therefore more than happy to summarise what is at stake."
"In 2002, a protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice created the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, a smart financial design using the interest accrued from the assets made available at the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Treaty."
"Activities under that Treaty were funded through a levy paid by the coal and steel industries, 27.2% and 72.8% of the budget being respectively allocated to coal and steel."
"Through a bottom-up approach, this Research Fund is intended exclusively to fund research projects in the sectors related to the coal and steel industries, two major traditional sectors where research is still needed: firstly, to comply with current EU policies on environmental standards to combat global climate change and, secondly, to maintain energy security of supply by having a fuel mix that meets European demand."
"The essential principles and proper decision-making procedures related to the management of this fund are defined in the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel."
"These technical guidelines are to be reviewed or supplemented every five years, the first period ending on 31 December 2007."
"On 10 July 2007, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the revision of these technical guidelines."
"This proposed revision looked to further the positive results achieved during the first five years of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel research programme, notably in terms of environmental protection."
"In the Commission's view, no major overhaul was needed, but rather a fine tuning of the existing rules in order to adapt the guidelines to EU enlargement, to the Seventh Framework Programme and to current European regulations, notably in terms of gender balance and financial management policies."
"This proposal for a Council decision was sent to the European Parliament for consultation, and this is the reason why we are here today."
"I would like to express my appreciation of the fact that Mr Gierek's report by and large supports the Commission's proposal."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, the Commission's decision regarding the continued functioning of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel should be received with satisfaction."
"This fund arose as a payment of 72.8% made by the steel industry and 27.2% made by the coal industry following the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty."
"The interest from this Fund amounts to around EUR 60 million a year, which makes it possible to provide top-up subsidies for research that does not come under the 7th Framework Programme."
"This concerns essential research for rationalisation of the functioning of both the iron and steel industry and coal mining, as well as research leading to further improvements in finished product quality in this industry, that is to say coal and steel."
"The need for such research activities is particularly relevant to these industries in the new countries of the European Union."
"Steel."
"Steel is still the most important construction material."
"The technological potential to raise the quality of various grades of steel and improvements in the efficiency of steel production are still far from exhausted, particularly where new technologies for the production of intermediate products for subsequent machining are concerned."
"Increased reliability of steel structures and increased operating efficiency of various items of machinery and equipment require considerable volumes of empirical research in this sphere."
"This also applies to improvements in chemical composition, and to improvements in the functional properties of various steel grades."
"Work on an effective and environmentally sound method of recycling scrap, e.g. steel from problematic galvanised automobile industry scrap, is also of exceptional importance."
"Coal."
"Coal means energy security."
"The competitiveness of this solid fuel, the definition of which, according to the proposal made in this regulation, is to be expanded for practical purposes to include bitumen shales, also known as oil shales, which are mined in Estonia, depends on efficient utilisation of its regional reserves."
"The specific problems of coal mining depend to a large extent on local geological conditions and require routine surveying work."
"These studies should precede the construction and operation of, for example, deep coking coal mines with a methane problem."
"Coal utilisation can also include the non-conventional method of its underground gasification."
"The continued proper functioning of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel requires that each advisory group include in its make-up experts able to guarantee optimal representation from the aspect of the location of the coal and steel industry in the European Union, with particular regard to experts from the new European Union countries."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) After a period of five years, in accordance with the Council guidelines, the European Commission reviewed the operation of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel."
"This Fund manages the assets of the now expired European Coal and Steel Community and invests the interest generated by the capital in coal and steel research."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission's proposal consistently reflects the changes that have taken place over the last five years, takes account of the provisions laid down in the Accession Treaties at the time of 2004 enlargement of the EU (one specific example already mentioned is Estonia's Treaty of Accession), incorporates the fact that the definition of the term 'coal' is now broader, and focuses in particular on job protection and on effective use of materials and energy resources in production and manufacturing industries."
"The provisions dealing with amendments to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development and to those areas that the Seventh Framework Programme does not cover in detail are also an important part of the proposal."
"In addition to the Commission's proposal itself, I would like to praise the work of the rapporteur, Adam Gierek, and his report."
"The results of the vote in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which adopted all the substantive amendments, are a testament to the excellent groundwork and sensible approach to further investment in science and research in the area of coal and steel, two raw materials for energy and production that are currently irreplaceable."
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask my colleagues to reject unambiguously the proposals by certain groups aimed at undermining the importance of coal and steel and conventional energy sources in general, or, as the case may be, the importance of the future of this Fund, which has proved to be irreplaceable in terms of financing research."
"Coal and steel are among the most important raw materials for energy and manufacturing that have developed significantly in recent years."
"The report should thus take into account, for example, the geographical location of reserves: this will contribute towards more effective energy use and better energy security in the European Union as a whole."
"on behalf of the PSE group. - (RO) The Research Fund for Coal and Steel was established after the expiration of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the first treaty upon the foundation of the European Union."
"Europe possesses important coal deposits, but we need to invest in new, cleaner processing solutions."
"Steel is a product still used by many industrial sectors, but research is necessary in this sector as well in order to identify cleaner and more efficient solutions from the energy point of view."
"The importance of this research is even greater since the two sectors entail a large number of jobs that must be kept and whose working conditions need to be improved."
"This research should also result in better working conditions for the employees of the two sectors."
"In Romania, approximately 34 million tons of coal are extracted every year and approximately 8 million tons of steel are produced."
"In these two industrial sectors, the number of directly or indirectly employed people is several hundred thousand."
"This is why I believe this document is extremely important."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, research efforts in the steel sector are necessary to protect the European steel industry and therefore the European economy."
"However, my approach to the coal industry is more guarded."
"James Hansen, climatologist and research director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, recently declared that the scale of climate change had been underestimated but that we have various tools at our disposal, one of which is the closure of all coal-fired power stations by 2030."
"One gas-fired power station emits between 300 and 400 kilograms of CO2 per megawatt-hour, a latest generation coal-fired power station emits 800 kilograms and a power station running on lignite emits 1 000 kilograms of CO2."
"How consistent is the European Union being if, on the one hand, it is developing an ambitious plan to combat and adapt to climate change and, on the other, it is supporting coal as a clean energy source?"
"Humanity has gone from the wood age to the coal age, then to the oil age."
"Today, Parliament has the choice of supporting a return to the coal age or being consistent with the climate package and therefore not establishing coal as a clean energy source."
"For this reason my Group intends to support some of the amendments by the Verts."
"In conclusion, allow me to give you a wonderful quote from Alphonse Karr: 'A lover is almost always a man who, having found a glowing coal, puts it in his pocket believing it to be a diamond.'"
"Love is indeed passion."
"For energy, let us opt for reason instead."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those people who championed the irrelevant amendments in committee."
"Yet in line with what Mrs Laperrouze said about coal, it is not at all clear to me why the Commission should stipulate subsidising coal ad infinitum, as it were."
"Coal has been subsidised to an unbelievable extent for 50 years, and continuing this is contrary to all the EU's statements on climate policy."
"We believe that, on the contrary, these coal subsidies should be replaced with more consistent support for renewable energies and energy efficiency."
"Otherwise Europe will not be in a position to meet its targets on climate policy."
"Steel is another story."
"Yet the Commission has omitted to make it clear that steel continues to be subsidised and coal does not."
"In my opinion sufficient provision has already been made for coal, a dirty energy source, in the Seventh Framework Research Programme."
"(NL) Mr President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, coal and steel were central at the start of the European Union, and still are, albeit as part of a completely different agenda involving globalisation, climate change and energy issues."
"It is 'all hands on deck', as it were; the input of this fund, however small, contributes to the technological revolution necessary to keep the steel sector competitive and to make coal a clean fuel, a clean raw material: 'clean coal'."
"The European Commission has also opted for this, on the eve of our pilot projects to achieve carbon capture and storage, for example as a technological innovation."
"I am emphatically in favour of this."
"I am not in favour of closing; I am in favour of keeping open."
"For example, NUON, a Dutch electricity company, is envisaging in Groningen a coal gasifier involving complete capture etc."
"This kind of project requires support and more resources than are currently on the table."
"More important - as Commissioner Potočnik knows - is my plea for a better combination of funds, Structural Funds, input from the European Investment Bank, etc. More matching, bundling, is required to enable major research into infrastructure and investment."
"The existing rule 'one fund, one project' is a definite hindrance."
"We must also tinker with these rules, and fortunately the European Commission is already testing the boundaries in this regard."
"On 5 and 6 March we spoke in Brdo, Slovenia, about more focus and bundling of European projects."
"This summer, the Commission will be presenting a new profile for the Esprit programme, to achieve more targeted investment."
"This is what we want to hear about, not the phasing-out of coal."
"That is indeed the wrong course to take."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Gierek on his report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, a research programme that manages its own resources outside the Seventh Framework Programme and that has an annual budget of EUR 60 million cannot but be well received and supported by Parliament, especially taking into account that steel is still used a great deal in various sectors of industry and that there are still many scientific and technological challenges to overcome in order to make production processes cleaner and more efficient."
"With regard to coal, the challenges are even greater due to its implications for energy production and for achieving our objectives for combating climate change."
"Making coal more competitive in the energy market, improving the safety and operating capacity of the mines and achieving cleaner combustion requires R&D, and the new technologies for capturing and storing CO2 are an area of research that the European Union has clearly backed."
"I therefore fully agree with the content of this report."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his sensitivity to gender equality by proposing measures to achieve a greater presence of, and participation by, women in a sector in which men are still in the majority."
"(RO) Starting from the immediate political priorities of the European Union, I would like to emphasize some budgetary aspects of this report."
"The Commission's proposal refers to the Green Paper on energy and the objective specified in it to increase the use of coal as an important source of energy, by using clean technologies, of reducing and storing carbon dioxide."
"The actions that could receive European financing from the Research Fund for Coal and Steel include pilot projects and projects demonstrating the latest technologies in this field."
"The problem is the extremely low budget allocated to this fund: 57 million euros every year."
"It is difficult for me to imagine how this amount could cover a significant number of projects throughout the territory of the European Union."
"I remind you that more than one quarter of the European Union countries continue to meet their energy needs by using coal as the main source."
"From this point of view, I believe greater financial involvement from the European Union is necessary in this sector, both by way of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel, and by the programmes of the Seventh Framework Programme."
"Mr President, I did not intend to contribute, but I feel compelled to on the issue of clean coal technology."
"The importance of clean coal technology is absolutely essential, and the question which needs to be asked is: what can the EU do, as the previous speaker just said, to support new technologies, including clean coal technology?"
"The advancement of clean coal technology is essential to our fulfilling our climate change targets, and there is such an urgency with this."
"The urgency can only be addressed by us working together across the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am particularly pleased that today the European Parliament is already discussing the second research project."
"I believe that steel research, in particular, is particularly important, especially in the face of climate change, because we are naturally striving to make production as efficient as possible and to make efficiency criteria an essential component of consumption."
"I should therefore like to reiterate my particular congratulations to the rapporteur on this report, and I can say that today is a real day for research."
"(RO) My speech starts from a few aspects: first of all, I am glad that coal and steel return, even if not very often, to the Parliament's agenda."
"I believe Europe's economic power relies on having the best steel at the lowest costs, therefore the results coming from common research should be shared at the Community level."
"In many European countries, there are regions that depend mostly on coal and steel production."
"The conversion of the labour force employed in coal and steel production is still unsolved and, unfortunately, the regions in question have entered the category of regions with problems in the standard of living and need cohesion programmes."
"At the end, I ask myself rhetorically if Europe will stop buying coal and steel from outside the Community if it does not want to align with the European Union environmental protection programme."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I appreciate the comments which support the proposal as much as I appreciate also the comments which called for a view of how we will approach energy and climate change solutions in the future."
"I must make it clear that today we are talking about additional funding for R&D based on an existing fund, based on a protocol - to be more precise, we talk about the technical guidelines."
"I believe that it is better that this money is used for research and development rather than for anything else, because it is true that in energy and climate change there is no room for complacency."
"CCS is one of the activities which will also be addressed, but it is far from being the real answer."
"So the real questions, and the real debate about the issues which you opened today, will come when we discuss the strategy for the energy technology plan - how to approach this, how to act in the future, and how to find the right answers."
"In this respect, it will be extremely important that we are aware that 'business as usual' is not an option."
"We lack human resources and we lack funding."
"The Framework Programme is only partially a solution for that."
"We will have to address that issue seriously because we need to look at it both from a short-term point of view, looking for possible solutions to fill the gap where the need is urgent, and at the same time for long-term solutions."
"Such solutions are very much needed and we must concentrate on renewables from today onwards."
"So I think that will be when we have to discuss that."
"Do not forget that the financing of energy in 1980 was approximately four times higher in Europe than it is today."
"So approaching these problems as though business as usual could continue would be another illusion."
"Do not make that mistake."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I am perhaps taking up just one issue that has been raised here today, namely the view that mines should be closed as soon as possible for environmental reasons."
"I think that energy security, for example in my country, in the Czech Republic and in many other EU countries, is not consistent with this view, and this view is not generally accepted."
"Quite the contrary, in fact: if only because of new technologies that are being developed, such as 'clean coal' and 'CCS', we shall probably be opening new mines in the future."
"Coal will continue to be an important and competitive source of energy in Europe for some time to come."
"We must also not forget - and here I am addressing those who would like to close all mines - that coal is not only an important raw material for energy, but also a chemical raw material."
"Firstly, then, the Research Fund for Coal and Steel is necessary."
"Secondly, this Fund is not met by the 7th Framework Programme, as it deals with an entirely different sphere of action."
"Thirdly, a rise in qualified costs from 40% to 50% is indicated."
"Fourthly, failure to include bitumen shales in the Research Fund for Coal and Steel programme - and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also put forward a proposal of this nature for these amendments - would have been injurious to Estonia, whose power generation is chiefly based on this fuel."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) In Poland, 95% of electricity comes from coal-fired power stations."
"Consequently Poland is particularly interested in new technologies for coal utilisation that improve efficiency in power stations, reduce CO2 emissions and enable coal to be converted into hydrocarbon fuels with restricted CO2 emissions."
"New technologies open up the possibility of utilising nuclear reactors as emission-free heat sources to achieve the stated aims of the coal industry."
"In order to implement the synergy between coal and nuclear energy, however, we need high-temperature reactors (HTRs)."
"In Europe, research into high-temperature reactors has been going on for some years now."
"Unfortunately there is not a single European research centre working on HTRs that might have the goal of introducing a coal-nuclear synergy programme."
"Such a centre would enhance Europe technologically, including the coal industry."
"It could also do much to support the acceptance of nuclear power in Europe through direct cooperation with the coal industry, striving to modernise it and not competing with it."
"Bearing in mind the importance of coal in the Polish energy sector, it would appear to make sense to set up such a European centre in Poland."
"Without decisive action, we shall lose the technology race in this sphere against the United States, South Africa, China and South Korea."
"I call upon the Commission to consider the need to establish such a centre as part of long-term technical guidelines relating to the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel."
"in writing. - (ET) Under the Protocol to the Nice Treaty on the expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel all assets of the ECSC were placed at the disposal of the European Commission in 2002."
"The revenue from these assets is to be used for research in the sectors related to the coal and steel industry."
"The Council has adopted two regulations to improve implementation of the research programme: a financial regulation and a technical regulation."
"The Gierek report concerns the latter."
"Under the Treaty of Accession of Estonia to the EU, oil shales were given the status of coal."
"As a result, the European Commission proposed that the Council should make the technical guidelines for the research programme on coal and steel consistent with the Treaty and included oil shales in the definition of coal under the technical guidelines."
"As a result, Estonian research into oil shales is eligible to apply for funding under the research programme on the same basis as coal."
"The Polish rapporteur, Adam Gierek, has proposed replacing 'oil shales' in the definition with 'bitumen shales', on the ground that the term 'bitumen shales' also covers 'oil shales'."
"In fact, the opposite is true: 'oil shales' is a broader term than 'bitumen shales'."
"The Greens have made a proposal to remove oil shales from the definition of coal completely."
"Once again I draw your attention to the fact that when it acceded to the EU, Estonia agreed that oil shales were to have the status of coal and therefore the basis of funding for the oil shales research programme must be the same as that of the research fund for coal and steel."
"in writing. - I was Parliamentary rapporteur when discharge was being granted for the last time in respect of the European Coal and Steel Community's activities."
"The funds in the expired Community were accumulated from the coal and steel industries, and so it is only fair that any money left over should go on research in these sectors and not be used to cover research in the oil industry."
"Research and research institutions are needed if we are to use emission-free or 'clean' coal."
"This includes carbon capture and storage (CSS), although there is not enough money in this fund to finance this, despite the huge need."
"It is interesting that today by chance Shell happened to call for public funding, meaning EU funding, for this."
"Mr Gierek, as rapporteur, is clearly tending to promote the use of coal in energy production, and he represents the best interests of his country in this."
"Moreover, it is not forbidden in the EU, but there is still a long way to go before we have clean coal."
"Cultural industries in Europe (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Guy Bono, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on cultural industries in Europe."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the report I am presenting follows on from the request made by Mrs Trüpel - who is here today and whom I welcome - and I, at the time of the 2007 Culture report three years ago, for greater recognition of the cultural industries, which I recall are now larger than the automotive industry in the European Union, accounting for 3.1% of the active population of the European Union and generating 2.6% of GDP."
"I have therefore prepared this report by consulting as much as possible with all those involved in the sector."
"Consequently I would like to thank all the experts and professionals from the industry, as well as web user and consumer associations and finally my colleagues in the Committee on Culture for all the discussions we have been able to hold on these crucial issues."
"This report is based on the following postulate: culture and the economy have today become inseparable."
"The economy needs culture and culture needs the economy."
"In view of this, culture urgently needs to be restored to its rightful place on the Lisbon agenda."
"With this in mind, I make a number of proposals in this report."
"The first would be to set up a task force to explore the relationship between culture, creativity and innovation in the context of Community policies."
"Secondly, it is essential make more room in our Community funding for the cultural industries."
"In this report, at the level of the Member States I recommend private/public funding as well as the promotion of a regulatory and fiscal framework that favours cultural industries, and more specifically the application of tax credits and reduced rates of VAT to all cultural products, including online works."
"I also call upon the Commission to look into the possibility of setting up a programme similar to the MEDIA programme for all the cultural industries."
"Thirdly, this report proposes that culture be better incorporated into the European Union's external policies because - and I want to stress this - what makes Europe so rich is its culture or rather, as I should have said, the diversity of its culture."
"I therefore invite the Commission and the Member States to increase the amount of aid for translation."
"Finally, if you will allow me Mr President, I would like to return to the issue of intellectual property rights, which are the subject of a great number of amendments in this report."
"On this subject, I strongly oppose the position of some Member States whose repressive measures are dictated by industries incapable of changing their economic model in line with the needs imposed by the information society."
"Cutting off internet access is a disproportionate measure in view of the objectives."
"This is a penalty with powerful effects, which could have serious repercussions in a society where internet access is essential for social inclusion."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think we need to make a distinction between mass piracy and consumers acting without a profit motive."
"Rather than criminalising consumers, we need to set up new economic models that strike a balance between the ability to access cultural activities and content, cultural diversity and genuine remuneration for those who hold intellectual property rights."
"It seems to me that this is the only way cultural Europe can truly enter the 21st century."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am happy to be here for the debate on Mr Bono's report and I should like to thank him for his contribution and the committee for its work."
"I am sure, as he said, that culture is important to our lives and it is more and more central to the future of the European Union."
"I would like to add that it defines our Community much more than business or geography."
"We also need to understand that culture makes a contribution; culture creates; culture is something positive, not consuming our budgets or conflicting with our needs but bringing a lot of enrichment, including jobs and growth."
"This was the first time that the European Union was able to explicitly recognise last year's summit conclusions, in the study we presented some time ago, and now in the cultural agenda for the European Union at a time of globalisation."
"I would like to underline just three specific ideas or items from your report, because there are many and I will not comment on all of them."
"First, you ask us to establish a European vision of culture, creativity and innovation."
"The European agenda we have now agreed does exactly that."
"We are strengthening the cooperation between Member States, including the promotion of creative industries."
"This is one of three pillars."
"Part of that work will need to look at how to measure more accurately the contribution these industries make to the economy and how best to support them."
"Second, you ask us to look at the external dimension."
"This is one of the three priorities of the agenda and we are very active now in encouraging our partners, our Member States, to ratify the UNESCO Convention - because not all Member States and also other countries in the world have done so - and also in ensuring its implementation."
"And we are increasingly including cultural elements both in our development cooperation and in our bilateral relations with emerging economies."
"Third, I agree with you that full attention has to be paid to implementing Article 151 fully in EU policies."
"I have established really good contacts and cooperation with my colleagues, including Commissioner McCreevy on the internal market, on the various aspects of copyright protection."
"I am confident that, with the help of all of you, we will achieve the objectives laid down in this Treaty article."
"You also mention the mobility of artists and cultural workers, which is very high on our agenda, especially this year."
"Member States have already constituted a working group on this topic and the Commission is implementing the pilot action on the mobility of artists proposed by this Parliament last year."
"The Commission will support all these efforts, in particular with a study to better understand the links between culture, creativity and innovation, as well as another study on how to have an environment conducive to the development of creative and cultural industries, including support for small and medium-sized enterprises and risk-taking."
"The results of these initiatives will feed into a Green Paper on cultural and creative industries, which the Commission plans to publish in 2009."
"I am looking forward to the debate."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new technologies are gaining ever greater weight in Europe's cultural industry."
"Particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property."
"The task of the European Union, and of the Member States, should be to provide the necessary resources to ensure that intellectual property rights are respected and protected."
"Combating piracy is particularly important in this regard."
"All those involved should be aware of their rights and obligations regarding a common solution to this task."
"In its report, our committee has argued in favour of awareness-raising and education campaigns, particularly with regard to consumers."
"Preparatory and education measures explaining the value of intellectual property should start among young people in schools."
"In this context I should like to emphasise once again the committee's opinion that criminalising consumers who are not seeking to make a profit is not the right solution to combating digital piracy."
"We have repeatedly emphasised that free information structures such as the World Wide Web are of great significance to the European creative sector and that we have to strike a balance between the openness of the Internet and the protection of intellectual property."
"In this context, Mr President, allow me one final comment on the revised version of Amendment 22a tabled by 40 Members."
"My group - the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - has clearly stated that it is prepared to support the first part of the amendment, and to emphatically reject the second part of this amendment."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, at a time when traditional economic sectors and industries are suffering from a significant downturn, and the pressures of globalisation are putting European businesses at a significant competitive disadvantage, the sector of cultural industries is one of the few to offer considerable possibilities for multi-faceted economic, regional, social and cultural development."
"At this stage, over and above Article 157 of the Treaty and the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, Europe must aim at an appropriate balance to help businesses, agencies, production and services in this sector to be fully competitive."
"At the same time, Europe must not put its distinct cross-cultural nature at risk or endanger diversity."
"For this reason, Commissioner, during the coming year, which is the European Year of Creativity and Innovation, as you have said yourself, I think that it is the right time for the EU to turn actively towards the cultural industries."
"We must get away from the perception that they are a luxury, but make specific policies to boost investment in this sector."
"Madam President, we fully support Mr Bono's report, which I think will also be seriously examined by Commissioner Figeľ, so that he can discuss and continue his creative work."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, we often encounter cases where the role and significance of culture are neglected."
"Business gets noticed, but culture is seen as something incidental, a sort of add-on."
"Not only is the cultural significance of culture underrated, but also its economic and social significance."
"Thanks to this report, we are presented with a different image of culture."
"Let us please just look at the numbers."
"The European Union has at its disposal 1% of the GDP of all Member States, while the culture industry alone provides 2.6% of GDP and over 3% of employment, so this is a very important problem."
"These data are incomplete, though."
"We know that they do not include the role and significance of crafts, handicrafts and artistic work, and they also fail to include numerous areas that are influenced by culture."
"I therefore consider this report to be a very important one, and we should continue this work and get involved, and support Commissioner Figel', because he has adopted a very good course - one which offers everyone an opportunity."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the rigid debate between the concept of culture as purely an end in itself on the one hand and the total 'marketisation' of culture on the other is forced open by the Bono report."
"We are emphasising the significance of the creative industries as part of the Lisbon Strategy for economic growth without at the same time subjecting cultural policy to purely economic constraints."
"The creative and cultural industries are seen as independent economic sectors, and they have been the driving force for jobs in Europe in recent years."
"In Germany, for example, they are creating more jobs than the car industry, and the European Union and the Member States must orient their policy accordingly."
"There is a great deal still to do in this regard."
"I should also like to emphasise once again - in the face of all the complicated arguments surrounding copyright - that the appropriate political rules still have to be found for the products of intellectual property in the digital world, to ensure open access to the Internet for private end-users on the one hand and create new income opportunities for artists who produce creative content on the other."
"Mr President, Mr Bono's report is an excellent document which we support."
"I shall be brief and restrict my remarks to the question of copyright."
"In the pre-digital world purchases of books and records could be regarded as a reflection of normal consumer trends."
"Photocopiers and cassette recorders dealt a blow to authors' remuneration and yet purchase continued to be the rule."
"With the digital world comes a paradigm shift."
"The Internet means that the sharing and free circulation of ideas, information and works have cast off their old physical restraints."
"In this world payment is a thing of the past."
"The free circulation of works is culture's natural habitat."
"We combat piracy for profit, but we are completely opposed to criminalising consumers."
"We still need some constraints and blocks in the digital world because we have not yet discovered another way of providing authors with suitable remuneration; but those days are numbered."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, Europe has a rich and diverse cultural heritage and one which enriches our lives, not just aesthetically but economically."
"The sector contributes 2.6% of the EU's GDP, as has been said."
"It shows higher growth than the economy in general and over five million people are employed in it."
"These are three very clear reasons why the Commission should keep its hands well away, unless we want to see culture go the same way as fishing and agriculture."
"However, the trading deficit in motion pictures alone between the EU and the United States grows year on year as European audiences choose American, rather than European, products."
"That deficit, according to the latest figures, was GBP 7.2 billion in one year alone."
"Free from the restraint placed on them by reliance on state funding, the six major US motion picture companies turned over USD 42.6 billion in 2006, whilst, according to a report by the European Audiovisual Observatory, the overall situation of the European film industry is deteriorating."
"That is because subsidies and legislation do not inspire artists - they breed bureaucrats and parasites."
"(SV) The possibilities for culture have changed radically with the emergence and spread of the Internet."
"In my opinion, these developments have been almost exclusively positive."
"Culture has been vitalised, democratised and disseminated widely."
"Despite this, much of the European debate currently focuses on problems which the Internet is claimed to create for those engaging in cultural activities."
"That is unfortunate."
"That is not to say that there are no challenges to culture."
"Copyright infringements and illegal file sharing are examples of such challenges."
"Large parts of this report also focus on these problems."
"Many proposals are currently circulating in Europe on how we are to deal with these issues."
"Unfortunately, in many cases little attention is devoted to our fundamental freedoms and rights as citizens."
"For example, perhaps the most controversial of these proposals right now seeks to ban those who have committed copyright infringement from accessing the Internet."
"I should like to take this opportunity of urging my colleagues to support the amendment which I have tabled to this report."
"Briefly, my proposal emphasises the positive role which the Internet has played in culture and democracy, but it also rejects the idea of banning individual citizens from access to the Internet."
"Copyright infringements and file sharing must be combated by sanctions which are proportionate and which respect fundamental rights and freedoms."
"Forbidding individuals to access the Internet is in my opinion a gross violation of freedom of expression and information and is anything but proportionate."
"The Internet is more than just a copying machine or a channel for the illegal dissemination of films or music."
"It is an arena for free speech, information and communication."
"For my younger brother, the Internet is as natural as watching television or chatting in the school playground at break time."
"And are we going to impose similar restrictions when a copyright is infringed in other ways?"
"It was not so long ago that I was at university and there, unfortunately, many students illegally copied their course literature, but to punish them by forbidding them to read books or write articles would clearly be unreasonable."
"Someone who has shoplifted food is not forbidden to buy milk and someone who has stolen a bicycle is not forbidden to use the street."
"So let us not do anything so silly as regards other offences just because they have been committed on the Internet. Thank you."
"(ES) Thank you, Madam President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bono, on this report on cultural industries, which covers a wide range of questions that he has sought to answer."
"I would like to comment briefly on one aspect that I consider to be a priority: in the information, communication and digital technology society new forms of production and distribution are constantly emerging that mean new opportunities for producers, creators, artists and consumers."
"In this new context it is essential to find new, balanced formulas that combine respect for the rights of creators with citizens' access to these cultural assets."
"In addition, cultural industries and creators, including SMEs, due to their dual cultural and economic roles, contribute both to promoting cultural diversity and to creating new jobs and possibilities for economic development and, given that they are part of one of the most dynamic sectors our economy, aid for the creative sector should be seen as an investment."
"Therefore, promoting lifelong learning that fosters creative talent and the phenomenon of synergies between businesses in the sector and schools should be a priority in European policies."
"(PL) Madam President, may I offer my congratulations on this important report on culture."
"The statement that, if he had to start all over again, he would start with culture, is attributed to Jean Monet."
"The written history of Europe goes back two and a half thousand years, and how rich and various is its content."
"Culture is a significant component of the development of our civilisation."
"Action favouring the industry that is linked to culture should be supported."
"It would be a good thing if funds could be found for the development of a network of modern libraries in Poland, with thought for people who cannot afford to buy books."
"There are still districts in Warsaw where there are no proper academic reading rooms."
"There is no working inter-library exchange system."
"Young people have to go into the city centre to access scientific works."
"The library system in the United States might serve as a model."
"Funds are needed for the development of local libraries that would provide access to the necessary materials, thus enabling people to educate themselves."
"I do not fully agree with Recital T of the report. National identity and language are at the root of creativity."
"Modern European culture only began when Dante and Petrarch began writing in Italian."
"The reason for the development of European civilisation has always been the spread of human individuality, its spiritual progress and the fact that peoples have made use of this to enrich the content of their own collective life."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, culture is a particularly strong and economic factor for us all, and we have seen that it generates multi-billion amounts in Europe, that millions of employees have a part in it and that many small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, are active in this field and are becoming very creatively and passionately active in the population."
"It is important to me that these cultural driving forces have optimum access to the new digital and audiovisual formats."
"It is important to be able to introduce oneself to the relevant audience, and to devise new products in lifelong learning, in particular, as it is precisely these new and innovative means that are developing and promoting creative talents appropriately."
"Madam President, I would very much like to thank Mr Bono for this report, which highlights the important role of the creative and cultural industries and, particularly, the increasing part they play in our economy."
"As most of you know, I represent London, which is, of course, one of the creative hubs of Europe."
"Because of that, I am very aware indeed of the benefits that creative industries can bring to a locality."
"London is diverse in culture and thriving in its creativity and, as the cultural industries represent a significant sector of London's economy, I very much welcome the recommendations to support their sustainability and growth."
"But, having said that, there is one matter of great concern, which has already been alluded to in discussions on another report this evening."
"That is that, while there are a huge number of employees within the industry who are women, there are not very many women in higher positions in the creative industries, and I very much hope that we will be able to address this in future deliberations."
"(PL) Madam President, the draft resolution draws attention to the link between a flourishing cultural industry and the cross-frontier mobility of artists; it urges the Commission to issue a Green Paper on the internal market for creators of products and services, which will provide an opportunity to compare achievements in this sphere."
"The report emphasises the role of culture in Community politics, and also the role of cultural education in the development of personality and a sense of identity."
"Creativity, and involvement in the creation of added value, are what determine the important economic role of the cultural industry."
"Its actual contribution to economic development, especially in the music and publishing sector, is many times in excess of expenditure on the development of culture."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"(CS) Cultural industries are key providers of value-added services, which are the basis of a dynamic, knowledge-based economy."
"They are an important source of job creation in creative areas that contribute significantly to a more competitive European Union."
"The calls to support cultural and creative industries through better qualification, education and training systems, in particular by seeking to provide students at all levels of education in cultural and artistic disciplines with professional training, reflect this situation."
"I support the calls to the Member States to include entrepreneurship studies in national secondary and higher education programmes, particularly in the fields of humanities, arts and culture."
"Further progress is also needed in the area of the mutual recognition of diplomas in art studies."
"I, too, would ask the Commission to take greater account of the special nature of the cultural sector in all policies relating to the internal market, competition, trade, business, and research and development."
"(DE) Madam President, I should just like to rule out any misunderstandings once and for all."
"This report is not about barring anyone in any way from access to the Internet."
"The Committee on Culture and Education has unanimously rejected this."
"It is about achieving a balanced relationship between open access to the Internet and the protection of intellectual property, and here we do indeed still have a large number of tasks to resolve and instruments to find that take account of both objectives."
"I should therefore like to specifically ask for this approach to be followed in the votes, too."
"Madam President, I appreciate this report, but I would like to make some remarks."
"The topic of the cultural industries is closely connected to the topic of the economic value of culture."
"Culture is now referred to in terms of means towards economic growth, and many studies now emphasise the economic impact of cultural activities."
"In this context, I recall the study The Economy of Culture in Europe made in 2006 by a private consultant, KEA European Affairs, that presents some impressive numbers for the cultural sector; however, these numbers are debatable since MP3 players, mobile phones and publicity are also considered by this study as 'culture'."
"Therefore, we feel that focusing on such economic aspects may lead to confusion, and important things such as creativity or artistic potential may be put in second place if they do not turn out to be sufficiently profitable."
"I am in favour of a cultural policy that supports cultural diversity, artistic creativity and the development of the artistic potential of individuals and communities: these are all guidelines that I think we should keep in mind for future action."
"Member of the Commission. - (SK) I have listened to the debate with interest."
"Of course, the report itself is very interesting and as the Chairwoman of the Committee, Mrs Batzeli, said, in many ways it also represents a stimulus for the Commission, for the Member States and for the world of culture and creative industries."
"I think that the main theme or main goal is to get an overall picture, to make these stimuli a centre of attention and to create an environment that is favourable to creativity, innovation, culture itself and the status of culture in our society and our relations."
"Allow me to say just a few words."
"We cannot exist without the economy but it is culture that lends meaning to our relations and our identities, and that defines the values that unite us in the Community."
"That is my answer to those who worry about everything being seen nowadays in economic terms and expressed in monetary values."
"Culture is about more than money but it is important to see it as a creative asset, as something that creates jobs and helps to develop the economy."
"The absence of culture in most cases results in the deterioration not only of the economy but also of politics and society."
"The absence of culture therefore has many consequences."
"That is why I am pleased to see broad support for creativity and innovation in the proposals concerning the European Commission's proposal for 2009."
"The formal proposal itself is already in this Parliament and I hope that the legislative procedure will soon lead to its adoption and to preparations for the European Year of Creativity and Innovation."
"In conclusion, I would just like to say a few words about fighting piracy."
"I believe, like many of you here today, that we must achieve a balance between accessing culture and its accessibility, communication and cultural opportunities on the one hand, and protecting intellectual property rights on the other hand."
"We must combat the abuse of intellectual property rights since this is often the reason why smaller and weaker enterprises collapse."
"That is the position of the European Commission."
"One way of dealing with this problem is through education: raising awareness of the importance of protecting intellectual property rights and not abusing freedoms."
"The other method is to invite and organise all stakeholders or those who have responsibilities in this area, to get them to cooperate and contribute to the efforts to protect intellectual property rights while developing access to electronic networks in modern communications."
"This is, after all, what we proposed for the first time in our recent proposal to reform the electronic communications networks and services (Telecoms Package) and it is also the European Commission's attitude to the fight against piracy."
"Of course, a lot has to be done by the Member States themselves."
"That is all I wanted to say, thank you."
"I look forward to further cooperation."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I think we should not forget what we are trying to achieve."
"Despite what some subjective studies would have us believe, it is not the 13% of Europeans downloading cultural content illegally who are threatening our culture, but it seems to me that it is the concentration of our culture in the hands of a few large groups that is damaging our diversity and therefore the richness of our cultural heritage."
"I will only give you one example, that of records."
"Today, 95% of what is distributed comes from the four big record companies."
"I believe it is important to ensure that consumers have genuine choice and it is necessary to guarantee pluralism of content in a very concentrated market where those chiefly responsible for innovation and creativity are small, not big."
"You were talking about SMEs, Commissioner, recommending a study which I think is a really interesting idea."
"The permission for a merger between Sony and BMG granted by the Commission totally contradicts the European policy to support SMEs in the music industry, which create more jobs than the large companies and represent 99% of the market players and 80% of innovation in this sector."
"It seems, therefore, that there is an urgent need to support diversity in the cultural sector, which is a genuine driver of growth and a means of development for individuals."
"In conclusion, I will say that it is the diversity of culture that makes it rich and not the other way around."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 10 April 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - Culture and creativity play a central role in promoting European citizenship."
"Both these items, culture and creativity, must be taken into consideration in future policies of the EU."
"An analysis of the economy of culture in Europe was sponsored by the Commission and important data has emerged."
"It transpires that culture taken in a general sense makes a substantial contribution to the economy indeed much more than originally estimated."
"Five years ago it was assessed that the cultural sectors contributed 2.6% of the EU GDP."
"In 2004 3.1% of the EU active population was working in this sector."
"The relationship between cultural activities and the economy in Malta and Gozo can be assessed by a recent 2007 study made by the National Statistics Office involving a total of 5086 participants enrolled in 34 dance schools."
"These dance schools employed 109 persons and generated a financial surplus of nearly 400 000 Euro."
"Total income surpassed 1 million euros."
"This is only one example proving the importance of cultural activities for the economy."
"in writing. - My region, the West Midlands, is leading the way in developing creative industries, with more than one in ten now employed in the sector."
"The region is one of the most multicultural regions in the UK and is proving that its competitive advantage in cultural diversity is becoming a source of creativity and innovation."
"However, the EU must make a stronger commitment to supporting cultural industries by stimulating job creation in this area to counter the relocation of the EU's traditional industries to emerging economies."
"What is needed is joined-up action and greater financial assistance for business start-ups and SMEs in cultural industries through the Seventh Framework Programme, the Structural Funds and the EU Social Fund."
"This will further harness the skills and talent of Europe's entrepreneurs and workers, to ensure that the necessary skills are available to further develop the sector."
"The EU must support creativity for more innovation and entrepreneurship."
"In the European Year for Intercultural Dialogue, we should also recognise the importance of cultural industries in creating awareness and understanding of other cultures, and, therefore, their importance for social cohesion."
"Similarly, Europe has a great deal to gain economically from its cultural diversity."
"in writing. - (FI) I wish to thank the rapporteur for producing a report that deals so comprehensively with the multi-faceted nature of cultural industries and the main problem areas associated with them."
"When pondering the status of cultural industries in European society, there are two basic principles that need to be remembered."
"Firstly, we need to understand how important culture is for people's quality of life."
"Cultural products enhance wellbeing."
"The Community recognises that Europeans have basic rights to education, which include people's right to culture."
"We are therefore talking about fundamental civil rights."
"Secondly, we need to understand how important culture is for those who produce it."
"For many the work is not just a passion - it is a livelihood."
"Receiving appropriate payment for one's work is a basic right."
"It is up to the legislators to ensure that such people can work in an environment which is not detrimental to their rights."
"There is no cultural output without its creators, and if they are not paid for the work they do, the result is a limit to cultural growth."
"Legislation on cultural industries, such as the protection of intellectual property rights and neighbouring rights, therefore always has to strike the right balance between culture's two social dimensions."
"It requires special sensitivity on the part of the legislator."
"It has to be recognised that cultural industries are a very special sector and therefore require a very special legal status."
"The main challenge for cultural industries is obviously information technology."
"They clearly benefit from developments in technology and the information market, but at the same time they need protection when new systems are being used."
"We also need the Commission to deliver prompt measures to clarify the relationship between intellectual property and culture and the economy."
"The main challenge is how we can guarantee fair and genuine remuneration for every right holder and each individual cultural industry for the work done, at the same time ensuring that consumers have choice and easy access to cultural products."
"in writing. - As the production of material goods is increasingly mechanised and outsourced, more people in Europe engage their talents in producing cultural goods."
"The KEA study commissioned by the European Commission significantly underestimates the contribution of cultural industries to our economy and society."
"While only 3.1% of the EU's active population may be directly generating monetary value in the cultural area, their impact is noticeable almost in every aspect of our lives."
"Pop culture carries cultural and social messages."
"Musicians and actors were instrumental in releasing the green economy wave."
"Music and film are powerful promoters of better understanding between people and of European values."
"Cultural industries predominantly created the demand for new technologies, for digital platforms."
"Therefore, it is vital that the European cultural industries remain viable."
"First of all, we must ensure that creative people are able to sustain themselves by their creativity."
"This means that we must enable the creators to distribute their work as widely as possible, without any fear of abuse from the middlemen or the consumers."
"I continue to see this as the leading motive of this report, for which I thank the rapporteur and my colleagues who contributed their thoughts."
"Culture in a globalising world (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Vasco Graça Moura, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having proposed a general framework for cultural matters in the context of the Lisbon agenda, I decided to incorporate into my report the many proposals put forward by Members since they were in line with the general approach."
"Therefore, if the report contains some points that might seem redundant when set against other instruments already approved in the meantime and in force, they serve to emphasise the topics thought to be the most relevant."
"Recalling the main points of that framework, I would say that the European Union has a very special duty to safeguard Europe's cultural richness."
"The European cultural heritage, in all its dimensions, must, by every means, be preserved and disseminated both within and outside the Union, without denying the fact that it is wholly desirable to take as open an attitude as possible to every other culture, which has, moreover, always been the hallmark of Europe."
"Our cultural heritage, encompassing its diverse forms of expression and the combination of its founding sources, such as, Graeco-Latin and Judaeo-Christian antiquity, has, over the course of history, placed Europe in the vanguard of all the continents."
"It has proved to be an unrivalled driver of innovation, development and progress, which has spread in every direction, and today still constitutes an essential reference point for humanism, spiritual enrichment and enlivenment, democracy, tolerance, and citizenship."
"In an increasingly globalised world, the outstanding specific qualities contained within the nucleus of Europe's cultural richness constitute genuine European added value and their identity-giving role is vital for Europe and the Union in that it helps them to understand the world, bring about cohesion, emphasise their uniqueness, and assert themselves in relation to other peoples."
"The particular ways in which the influence of European cultural heritage has over the course of history found expression in other continents must lead to special measures emphasising those factors which serve to build civilisation, mutual understanding and a constructive approach uniting the peoples represented."
"We recommend the Council and the Commission should enhance the prestige of Europe's classical heritage and the historic contributions of national cultures in all their dimensions down through the centuries, while also allowing for the needs of the culture sector in the future."
"We therefore suggest that the year 2011 be considered 'European Year of the Greek and Latin Classics' in order to make the peoples of the Union and the rest of the world more aware of this essential aspect of cultural heritage now in danger of being forgotten."
"For the same reason we stress the need to develop the promotion of European languages in the world and their role in creative artistic activity in other continents, so as to facilitate both mutual knowledge and understanding and the cultural interaction generated and conveyed by those languages in their extra-European dimensions."
"On the other hand, the existing Community programmes in the culture sector do not fully reflect the implications of Europeans' common cultural heritage, which is why we need specific programmes in order to foster creativity and preserve the links, on a wider scale and at a deeper seated level, with the goods and values, both tangible and intangible, that constitute European cultural heritage and to enable those goods and values to interact according to the humanist conception of identities and differences and in present-day cultural works."
"The programmes in the cultural sector will all do a great deal to foster cohesion, real convergence, economic growth, sustainable development, innovation, employment and competitiveness, but we should not forget that culture and cultural products have value in themselves (culture qua culture)."
"We would remind the Council that the intended budgetary funding for the measures proposed in the Commission communication and those already in existence need to be reviewed immediately and as a matter of urgency."
"Finally, since there is no time to mention any more points, I welcome the Commission's communication and its approval by the Council."
"We agree with the objectives set."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Graça Moura for his commitment, the Committee itself and all relevant contributors to this report."
"I believe that it confirms that culture deserves a more central place in our discussions, and in our days and years of cooperation."
"I think it is confirmation that we have moved from an original agenda dominated by hard material - coal and steel - to intangibles like culture, education, creativity and citizenship."
"We cannot measure it in kilos or tonnes but it is about the future of our unity, of our communities at local, regional and national, as well as European, level."
"I think that is why we put forward the proposal."
"Since last year it has received a great deal of concrete attention and support in the public domain in the Member States as well as in the Council."
"I am happy to see it because this was the most important answer: we want to work more through culture, for culture and also for the world of cultures or culture in the world."
"I am happy to see your support for this agenda, which is also very important."
"It has always been very clear to me as Commissioner, and also to the Commission, that the Parliament seeks to do more in these areas."
"Of course we need to adopt a common approach."
"This is the way to implement this agenda."
"The three basic areas are important, and were also mentioned in the previous report: creative industries; cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue; and, equally important, the external dimension - external cooperation in culture and culture in the Union's external policy."
"I agree with you that we should not give too much weight to the economic importance of culture, but we really need to get the right balance in our cultural policies."
"Your report rightly recognises the importance of giving culture a larger role in international relations."
"We consider that this is an opportunity to build a proactive and constructive agenda on cultural diversity in Community policies."
"I know I can count on your collaboration in this matter."
"On the issue of mobility, we support the need for transnational mobility of cultural players as a major tool for building a European cultural area."
"Look, for example, at Erasmus in education."
"After a decade - now two decades - we have a European higher education area, the most popular programme and a lot of modernisation and openness at our universities."
"I think this quest for mobility, knowledge, respect and acceptance should also be developed in the area of arts and culture."
"I believe we can achieve a great deal now by starting the pilot project on mobility that you in the Parliament proposed last year."
"Last, but not least, it is important, as I said, to adopt a common approach."
"I am happy that Member States endorsed open methods of coordination."
"In November last year two expert working groups with representatives of Member States were set up with the aim of enhancing mobility of artists and culture professionals, as well as maximising the potential of the cultural and creative industries."
"You will be duly informed of the results of the work within these groups."
"As you know, we set up the cultural forum and the first was organised under the Portuguese Presidency, for which I am grateful."
"We also suggest that the cultural and creative sector at large should set up a platform on the cultural and creative industries and one on the access to culture, along the lines of the existing platform on intercultural dialogue."
"I think that there is a growing volume of potential contribution and I am happy to work with my colleagues in the Commission, as well as here with you in Parliament, to reinforce the mainstreaming of culture in many other EU policies."
"I am, of course, looking forward, not only to the debate, but especially to the implementation of this agenda."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to offer my sincere congratulations to Mr Graça Moura on a good report that, in a coherent and specific manner, presents the priorities in the sphere of culture and defines the long-term aims."
"The report shows the importance of culture for the development of the European Union and for enhancing the potential for innovation and increased competitiveness."
"Culture is a sector that creates jobs and gives a genuine boost to economic growth."
"On behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of the regions of the European Union as an important forum for cultural cooperation."
"Culture and language stimulate the development of regions and are a magnet for investment, especially in poorly developed regions with meagre natural resources and few tourist and leisure attractions."
"This is why local and regional authorities have such an important part to play in generally supporting and nurturing culture in the areas under their control."
"There is just one item in the report about which I have reservations - and here I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, so that I do not have to repeat myself in a moment - and that is what we find under Recital K, which suggests that we demand that immigrants and tourists subordinate themselves to European tradition and heritage."
"This is not a good piece of phrasing."
"During the Committee's work, the members of the ALDE Group voted against this."
"In the Year of Intercultural Dialogue it is worth pointing out that the European Union should, in putting into practice the values of intercultural dialogue, be open to other cultures."
"It should promote and create common ground for cooperation by putting forward interesting programmes."
"It is therefore not a good thing that the potential for European third countries to take part in the exceptionally engaging and prestigious European Capital of Culture programme after 2010 has been scrapped."
"Madam President, I was supposed to be making a further speech in just a moment, so I would like to request another 10 seconds this time round, if I may, and then I shall not get up a second time."
"I believe that it is first and foremost those countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy that should have the possibility of taking part in this programme."
"I keenly support the demand made in the report for 2010 to be declared as the European Year of Fryderyk Chopin, given that it is the 200th anniversary of the birth of this composer of genius, who made an incontrovertible contribution to European and world culture."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura most sincerely on behalf of my group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for his excellent report."
"Thank you, too, to the Commission for presenting this communication on the European agenda for culture."
"It can count on Parliament's support for culture as a horizontal task, for increasing artists' mobility, for increasing regional cooperation and for strengthening international cooperation."
"However, we also note the absence of something on this agenda."
"This is a subject we discussed in detail a little while ago."
"The cultural industries and their growing significance also mean that the economic aspects are becoming considerably stronger than has been the case in the past."
"The agenda for culture is not only about issues of better cooperation on the cultural agenda or of increased funding, but also of the legal framework."
"In that regard, it is indeed true even within the European Union that, if culture is in competition with internal market law or competition law, it always draws the short straw in case of doubt."
"You will all remember the Lévai report: the Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services described collective management societies for online music as obstacles to competition on the internal market."
"Here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than European internal market law."
"Hence the urgent need, and tomorrow Parliament will decide the same way as the Committee on Culture and Education."
"The Unesco Convention must be applied not only to securing cultural diversity with regard to third countries, but also as a matter of the utmost urgency in our own European law."
"Our heartfelt plea to the Commissioner, therefore, is that we have just one time slot, and therefore need a proposal quickly for strengthening cultural diversity in European internal market law."
"on behalf of the PSE. - (ET) Colleagues, our colleague Vasco Graça Moura has carried out some excellent work in compiling a report which refers both to cultural heritage and future needs, to common principles and specific initiatives."
"As shadow rapporteur, I express my thanks."
"I would like to focus on just a couple of points."
"As of the beginning of 2009 our circumstances will have changed: the Lisbon Treaty will have entered into force."
"In order for our diplomatic representatives to be able to represent our cultures properly, the cultural dimension should be consistently incorporated into our external policy."
"Currently we are a long way from achieving that."
"Initially we are talking of incorporating a cultural dimension only into development activities although this in itself poses difficulties for us."
"There are many very valuable elements in European culture, but instead of enjoying the aggregate of those elements we seem to achieve only an arithmetical average."
"European culture has, unfortunately, only a small presence worldwide."
"I venture to believe that the world's finest film-makers and writers live in Europe, yet the world's cinemas are dominated by Hollywood and the bookshops are full of entertainment in paperback form from America."
"Why do we translate mass foreign products, and why do we not translate each other's best authors?"
"Why do third countries aided by us prefer to spend money on American cultural products?"
"This situation is in need of change."
"We must without doubt place greater focus on re-establishing a common European cultural space."
"A cultural space which includes the countries of the Mediterranean and Central Europe as well as the Nordic, Baltic and East European countries."
"We will be stronger as a result, and will achieve an aggregate incorporating all the valuable elements, an aggregate which is greater than the sum of its parts."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, this is a very valuable and thoroughly prepared document."
"I congratulate Mr Graça Moura."
"The draft resolution draws attention to the need for a specific approach to the problems of culture at a time of globalisation."
"Regardless of our openness to the heritage of other cultures, it is exceptionally important to protect, disseminate and promote European culture."
"It is important to remember the roots of our culture, and especially the role of the Greek and Latin classics; however, we should also look at those areas of culture that cross borders without hindrance and without the need for translation."
"I have in mind music and painting."
"In 2010 it will be 200 years since the birth of Fryderyk Chopin - a composer of genius who is known throughout the world."
"Emphasising the significance of this event will make it easier to perceive the part played by all the outstanding European musicians - Mozart, Liszt, Handel, Haydn, Schumann, Verdi, Grieg, Berlioz, Paganini and many others - in the creation of European civilisation and in its contribution to world culture."
"The report also draws attention to current problems faced by artists in such matters as crossing frontiers, as well as the impact of their mobility on artistic development, and emphasises the role of art in economic development."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the interesting thing in this paper on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world is that it really asserts the strategic claim not only to organise cultural policy as a sector, but that culture should be an integral part of various European policy fields, such as foreign policy, urban development policy and Structural Funds policy."
"This really is a new quality."
"It changes the European Union's self-image regarding the importance of culture and its strategic importance to policy as a whole."
"Culture is always a double-edged sword, and this is what is particularly interesting."
"It is always a product, but it is more than a product because it carries meaning and purpose."
"This evening I should like once again to put it in graphic terms: I am anticipating that this dual nature of culture will really have an effect in all policy fields, particularly regarding internal-market logic."
"Besides, Commissioner Figeľ will be very strong if he is successful in imparting the strategic importance of culture to the other Commissioners."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) A globalised world implies global culture."
"This, however, is a term that can be interpreted in many ways."
"Across the European Union a global culture can be the essence of the best that individual European cultures represent."
"It can also be a post-modern universal culture that gradually overrides and forces out original European diversity."
"Personally, I favour the former scenario."
"I want the European Union to promote cultural diversity that enriches nations and lets them learn from each other."
"A globalised world globalises our lifestyles and ways of working."
"Multinational companies have turned our cities into a common marketplace so that sometimes we do not know whether we are in Paris or in Prague."
"As far as I am concerned, we have now had quite enough."
"Culture has a place in the soul of a nation and roots in its place of origin."
"Culture can be communicated and is capable of both absorbing and eliminating."
"It is also vulnerable, however, if it becomes a mere commodity or makes concessions to popular tastes in order to be 'accessible to all'."
"Culture should indeed be accessible to all but it should promote high values instead of pandering, set higher targets instead of reflecting our low demands, because the general public does not need a great deal to satisfy it."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for emphasising in his report the importance of preserving the cultural heritage of all European nations."
"(HU) Madam President, I warmly welcome this worthwhile report by Mr Graça Moura."
"In this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, we must emphasise the special significance of culture in reinforcing European identity."
"As an ethnic Hungarian from Romania, I would like to draw Member States' attention to supporting Europe's minority and endangered cultures."
"Examples of these include the ancient cultures of the ethnic Hungarians living in Romania, the Moldavian Csangos, the Szekler people of Transylvania, as well as those of the Macedonians in Greece and Bulgaria, the ethnic Serbs in Romania and the Basque people in Spain."
"The recommendation adopted by the Council of Europe on the basis of a report on the Csango people by the Finnish MP Tytti Isohookana-Asunmaa is a concept that could be emulated, as its objective is to preserve the Csango culture, which is on the point of extinction."
"In the context of the European Union's foreign relations, we must also pay heed to Tibet, under occupation by the Chinese Communist dictatorship and where, as the Dalai Lama has put it, cultural genocide has been unleashed on one of the world's most ancient cultures. Thank you."
"(FR) Madam President, first I would like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura for the quality of his report, which in every point reflects his knowledge and high level of expertise on the subject."
"This report reaffirms culture's place in the construction of Europe and the need to protect it and to promote diversity."
"He underlines the essential role it plays in meeting the Lisbon targets and in the EU's external relations."
"He quite rightly calls for the strengthening of actions in areas such as literary translation, the promotion of European languages, the teaching of art and the cultural industries, but also in the protection and promotion of our heritage."
"In this regard, we need to promote existing cultural programmes and support new initiatives such as the creation of a European heritage label, which will help to develop a common identity while encouraging cultural tourism."
"This report also highlights the opportunities offered by digital technologies in terms of access to and the promotion and spread of culture, while emphasising the need to protect intellectual property rights."
"In this context, it is right to support the setting up of specific projects such as the European digital library, the purpose of which is to digitalise our heritage and access to it, and preserve it for future generations."
"(DE) Madam President, thank you to the rapporteur and also to the Commission for this document."
"Once again the central role of culture in European integration and in the worldwide image of the European Union is being highlighted."
"How we choose to deal with this recognition, which is not new but is extremely important, and integrate it into every area of policy - as is already specified in Article 151 - has been well defined in the present agenda for culture."
"It is pleasing that, during the preparatory work, a wide consultation process took place with various cultural stakeholders who do essential cultural work, for which we must thank them."
"We urgently need this cultural strategy in order, for example, not only to be continually referring to our cultural diversity with pride, but also to be able to cope with the challenge of dealing with this diversity and the problems that arise."
"Implementation of the strategy will be crucial, however."
"President Barroso announced a task force for culture back in November 2005 in Budapest, which could be an important signal to the outside world, but has not so far been implemented."
"I hope this will not be the case with this agenda for culture."
"Promoting culture is a return on investment in the areas of intercultural dialogue, of implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and of internal relations, and it is also above all a social value added."
"We use art and culture."
"It offers us great benefit in almost every social and economic field."
"It should not be exploited, taken advantage of or starved out, however, and we should also therefore be thinking of an appropriate budget."
"(RO) I congratulate the Rapporteur, my colleague Vasco Graça Moura, for the way in which he knew how to manage the rather large number of amendments to this report."
"Personally, I was glad when the Committee on Culture and Education of the Parliament approved, with a large majority of votes, my amendment regarding the study of the European Union history in all Member States."
"The European Union construction should be studied so that young people would know the stages of the European Union's establishment and development."
"I believe that, in order to know the culture of a country, each of us should know the history of the given country."
"Creating a parallel with the European Union, in order to know and understand European culture in a globalized world, we should learn the history of European construction, especially since, as of 2009, the new Treaty of the European Union will become effective, we will all be European citizens and each citizen has the obligation to know his/her history."
"My initiative aims at preventing future situations in which young people learn parallel histories, which have no ground in reality."
"Since the European Parliament has just celebrated half a century of existence, I believe it deserves to have a history that promotes cultural identity and European culture in the context of globalization."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I particularly welcome this report because it shows that this Europe is growing together and that culture plays a very special role in this."
"If we think of the Capitals of Culture alone - next year it will be the city of Linz in Upper Austria - these give many creative artists the opportunity to get to know another new part of Europe."
"Later on there will also be a lot of visitors travelling from Linz to the other Capitals of Culture."
"This programme contributes a great deal to mutual understanding."
"In the case of Vilnius, in particular, we have a very good opportunity to show how strong cooperation can actually be."
"This should also be an example for the future."
"Madam President, the point I want to make concerns equal access to culture no matter what your background; rich or poor, culture has to be accessible to all."
"Free entry to museums and art galleries - certainly in Scotland and the United Kingdom - has seen record levels of people visiting cultural institutions."
"That is why free access to cultural institutions and cultural events is so important across the European Union."
"Many of the points in this report - paragraphs 10, 25, 26, and 46 about 2011 being the 'European Year of the Greek and Latin Classics' - are very interesting."
"The decline in the teaching of classics in state schools in my country of Scotland is deeply depressing."
"How can we understand the present without understanding the past?"
"I am grateful for the report."
"(CS) The European Union has a duty to safeguard Europe's cultural wealth because our cultural heritage must be preserved, disseminated and shared both within and outside the Union."
"If this plan is to be implemented, it must receive political and financial support."
"The Community's existing cultural programmes do not fully reflect the scope of our common European cultural heritage."
"I support the calls to the Commission to propose specific programmes to promote both artistic creativity and the tangible and intangible goods and values that constitute European cultural heritage."
"This cultural heritage should be managed in a sustainable manner."
"The support of public/private partnerships is vital to achieve this goal."
"The proposal to establish a European arts sponsorship scheme may be a step in the right direction."
"(RO) It is more than suitable to discuss, in the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a true European agenda for culture, which is to be promoted both inside the European Union and internationally."
"Therefore, I welcome the drafting of this report, which correctly emphasizes the importance of this field and the need to mobilize its potential fully."
"Culture is the basis of promoting the values of peace, democracy and tolerance, as well as a highly-performant economic growth that could deal with the challenges of globalization in the 21st century."
"From the report's multitude of recommendations, I would like to reiterate two aspects."
"First of all, at an internal level, it is essential for the local and regional actors to get involved in promoting culture, as factors of economic development and Lisbon Strategy implementation, as well as of consolidating cultural heritage and promoting cohesion in contemporary society."
"Second, it is in the European Union's best interests to promote culture and intercultural dialogue at an adequate level in its foreign policy."
"In this field, the countries included into the Neighbourhood Policy should be the main beneficiaries of these actions."
"Member of the Commission. - (SK) Thank you for the debate and in particular for the positive, constructive atmosphere."
"This is a testimony to the belief in the importance of culture and the current agenda."
"I want to assure you (although I am one of the new arrivals from the enlargement) that never before in the Union has culture been as prominent and as central as it is today."
"Of course, this is not only about the formal agenda: it is about a process, progress and implementation."
"In recent years several things were achieved for the first time in history: the European Commission's role as a representative of the Community as well as common representation of Europe's 25 or 27 Member States in UNESCO are the results of a certain cultural maturity."
"A few months ago the Member States agreed to introduce an open method of coordination although many people did not expect them to do so."
"We have a permanent forum for culture, 2008 is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and there is a consensus on making 2009 the European Year of Creativity and Innovation: all this represents enormous progress."
"On the other hand, culture has of course a dual nature."
"It has an economic dimension but it is also a vehicle for conveying meaning and substance."
"That is why culture is specific and lacks exclusivity in European law."
"That is also why in individual cases or disputes we want European law to apply but at the same time we want the specific nature of culture to be taken into account: the need to maintain and strengthen the culture diversity that is our heritage, our distinguishing feature."
"Before I finish, let me say that I agree that more investment is needed."
"The Commission proposed a budget of EUR 500 million for the Culture Programme but only EUR 400 million was approved."
"In the future it may be possible to support cultural aspects under other programmes as well."
"When we were summing up the contributions of the Structural Funds to individual structural operations in the 27 Member States, I was very pleased to find out that for the period 2007-2013 approximately EUR 5 billion have been allocated to culture as a whole, across the entire Union, from the Structural Funds."
"If we act responsibly, we can combine our individual potential, resources and policies."
"This, I assure you, is also my responsibility and I would like to invite you to cooperate and help to implement this agenda."
"Finally, I would like to thank Mr Vasco Graça Moura once again."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, after so many good contributions I am sorry to have to reply briefly just to some of the points that I consider essential, but I think they all, like the many points in the report not mentioned here, bring extraordinary enrichment to this debate."
"First I should like to stress the new policy to introduce culture in the terms set out in the Commission's communication."
"That was mentioned by Mrs Trüpel and it is a question of ensuring that the cultural aspect is included in other European policies."
"I think that is fundamental."
"The second point was raised by Mrs Mikko, and concerns the cultural dimension that should be incorporated in Europe's external policy, not merely European Union culture but the culture of the Member States - it is absolutely essential."
"Thirdly, as Mrs Hieronymi mentioned, there is a fine balance between economic aspects and the economic utility of culture and culture as a value in its own right (culture qua culture)."
"Just two more points, Mrs Staniszewska mentioned the importance of cultural action at regional and local level that is also emphasised in the report, but I think needs to be underscored."
"I am in complete agreement with that."
"Finally, I must also stress that giving families and students access to culture via schools and society, as well as building bridges between cultural heritage and the exact sciences, innovation and technology, are fundamental aspects of those concerns."
"Madam President, since it is impossible to go into any further aspects, I should merely like to conclude by saying that culture is an inalienable and indispensable system of individual collective values and experiences and that it is with those collective and individual values and experiences in mind that Europe should approach the future."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 10 April 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - I wish to use this opportunity to outline some major issues presented in the Graça Moura report on the 'European agenda for culture in a globalising world'."
"First, the social situation of artists: I agree with the fact that we should work out an appropriate legal framework in the areas of tax, labour and social security for artists and performers."
"We should also focus more on the preservation of cultural heritage."
"The Culture Programme is good, but is not enough, and I support the idea that we should have other programmes alongside it, more focused on the preservation and promotion of European cultural heritage."
"Last but not least, I wish to emphasize the need for an effective partnership between the public and the private sector."
"In order to overcome the present challenges, culture should be partially funded by the private sector."
"Therefore, a European arts sponsorship scheme should be created as soon as possible."
"in writing. - (HU) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the efforts of the Commission in proposing an agenda for culture enabling a European strategy to be pursued both within the European Union and in the EU's relations with third countries."
"In this Year of Intercultural Dialogue, it is important to devote special attention to promoting diversity and intercultural dialogue, as culture is a key dimension of the Lisbon Strategy and we will not achieve the fundamental Lisbon goals unless we treat it as such."
"I was disappointed to see that the report pays scant attention to relations among cultures, minorities, national or ethnic groups, or among the countries they live in."
"We cannot ignore the fact that the arts have a prominent role to play in the integration of minorities, but they can also provide social support for talented but impoverished artists."
"By supporting the arts and artists, we can provide prospects for poor ethnic groups that are transnational in character, such as the Roma people, who have preserved their centuries-old cultural tradition to the present day."
"Furthermore, we must ensure that regulations governing commercial (Internet) relations are open and transparent to ensure fair market access, thereby allowing European cultural industries to develop all their potential, particularly in the audiovisual and musical sectors."
"Alongside adequate consumer protection, we must eradicate the root causes of counterfeiting and piracy, and protect Europe's cultural diversity by means of sound and fair regulation of competition based on achievement."
"Fishing activities of Community and third-country fishing vessels (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Philippe Morillon, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters - C6-0236/2007 -."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report."
"Since the adoption of the Council Regulation on fisheries outside community waters in 1994, many conditions have changed and international obligations have increased for the authorisation of Community vessels outside Community waters."
"This proposal has, therefore, been put forward as part of the 2006-2008 Action Plan for simplifying and improving the common fisheries policy."
"The aims of the proposal reflect that spirit by integrating existing legislation into one regulation, while ensuring that the rules applying to Community vessels in third-country waters are applied equally to third-country vessels in Community waters."
"Many provisions are unchanged regarding the current system of issuing fishing authorisations."
"The major new points of the proposal can be summarised as follows."
"Firstly, all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are included in the scope of the proposal, those being fisheries partnership agreements, bilateral fisheries agreements, agreements in the context of regional fisheries management organisations and private agreements."
"This wide scope is essential, as all flag states under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea are responsible for the vessels flying their flags."
"Consequently, vessels fishing under all kinds of agreements should be included."
"Secondly, a mechanism to reallocate under-utilised fishing opportunities has been introduced in order to optimise the utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements."
"This point was raised during the discussions on most fisheries partnership agreements and is now integrated into each of them in order to increase the value for money under each agreement."
"As a last point, I would like to mention the proposed provisional application of fisheries agreements, which will grant the Commission the necessary legal basis to transmit licence applications to third countries prior to the adoption of the Council Regulation concluding the agreement."
"This will, in most cases, ensure that Community vessels can continue their fishing activities in third-country waters without interruption."
"Turning to the report, I would like to comment on the amendments proposed."
"The Commission can agree to Amendments 1, 3, 5, 11 and 16."
"As for Amendments 7 to 9 concerning the eligibility criteria, this list has been transformed into a positive list, rather than a negative one, in the first Presidency compromise text."
"In general terms, the compromise text, however, covers the Committee's concerns, except for the extension of the eligibility criteria regarding infringements in the past 12 months, which is Amendment 8."
"The Commission finds that this provision should remain unchanged, believing it important as a precautionary measure in case of possible serious infringements."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment 2 on the definition of infringements, as the definition of serious infringements is clear and is set out in Regulation No 1447/99."
"Regarding the amendment concerning non-transmission of all applications, which is Amendment 12, it should be noted that Article 10 has been deleted as part of the Presidency compromise text."
"This was done on the basis of the opinion of the Council's legal service, which stated that the Commission has no legal basis to penalise the vessels of Member States as proposed in this article."
"The Commission also finds that the Member States' possibility of giving their opinion on any decision is already provided for in Article 9(2) and that any informal procedure prior to or after a negotiation should not be contained in this regulation."
"Therefore, Amendments 6 and 10 cannot be accepted."
"Before closing, I would like to stress the following."
"Firstly, the daily transmission of catch data is required under the Regulation on electronic logbooks."
"Secondly, closing a fishery implicitly means that fishing authorisations are no longer valid for the stocks or areas concerned."
"Thirdly, all fishing activities in mixed fisheries must be considered as affecting the stocks concerned."
"Fourthly, national legislation determines what can be used as evidence in a court of law."
"This is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 13, 14, 15 and 17."
"Amendment 4 and Amendments 18 and 19 cannot be accepted, since the text proposed by the Commission is correct - in the case of Amendment 4 - or is sufficiently clear - in the case of Amendments 18 and 19."
"Equally, I cannot accept Amendments 20 to 24, since the scope of the proposal is to cover all agreements and not just third-country agreements, as I said at the outset."
"In addition, the reallocation of unused fishing opportunities is necessary in order to ensure the best possible utilisation of the fishing possibilities under the agreement."
"Such reallocation is best dealt with in the context of the issuing and renewal of licences."
"Finally, I would like to stress that this proposal is part of a package containing the proposal on combating IIU fishing, as well as the revision of the Control Regulation to follow later this year."
"As referred to by the Committee on Fisheries, the Commission will, while keeping transparency and simplification in mind, aim to harmonise these proposals and avoid any overlap between them."
"Just to explain: because it is a Commission proposal, the Commission speaks first."
"I think Mr Morillon was looking as confused as I was."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, nothing surprises me, and in particular nothing surprised me in the Commissioner's communication."
"Commissioner, thank you for that very detailed exposé."
"I would simply like to recall here that the declared objective of the Council's proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the procedures for managing fishing authorisations."
"It was a question of introducing general provisions applicable to all authorisation applications, as you yourself said, Commissioner."
"A single procedure for managing all fishing authorisations has been proposed."
"The sharing of responsibilities between the Commission and the Member States is defined."
"New eligibility criteria, penalties in the event of infringements and provisions regarding reporting are also proposed."
"Compliance with the international regulations laid down by the different agreements is strengthened by the introduction of measures requiring Member States to exclude vessels from fishing if they are found to be involved in a serious infringement or if they have been placed on a list for taking part in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing."
"Mrs Stihler had been designated for this report but because the majority of members of the Committee on Fisheries did not agree with her on two points she considered key, she preferred to remove her name from the report."
"It therefore falls to me to present this draft as Committee chairman."
"However, I would like, in passing, to thank her for her work and I will leave it to her, when she presents her amendments, to give us the reasons for her decision."
"Within the framework of the consultation procedure, in her report which is now mine, the Committee on Fisheries has proposed a number of amendments to the Council's proposal for a regulation, and you gave an exhaustive list of these - not a list but the numbers, Commissioner."
"These were adopted by a large majority of 19 votes for, 5 against and 2 abstentions."
"I will only present the main ones here."
"Firstly, the regulation should not apply to overseas territories of EU Member States."
"Secondly, an infringement should not be considered to be serious unless it has been confirmed by a successful prosecution in accordance with the relevant national legislation."
"Thirdly, the IUU list should be understood to mean the list of fishing vessels identified in the framework of a RFMO or by the Commission under the Council Regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing - that very important task, Commissioner, which you are personally rather keen on."
"Fourthly, the Commission shall not refuse to transmit applications to the authorising authority without having given the Member States the opportunity to submit their observations."
"Fifthly, the Commission may not refuse to pass on applications unless it comes to the Commission's knowledge, on the basis of duly substantiated facts, that a Member State has not complied with its obligations under a particular agreement."
"Sixthly and finally, Community fishing vessels for which a fishing authorisation has been issued shall transmit to their competent national authority the data concerning their catches and fishing effort with a frequency appropriate to the agreement and fishery concerned."
"The transmission requirements shall be compatible with those contained in the e-logbook regulation."
"I will leave it to my colleagues to talk more about some of these amendments, because some of them are the authors."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, in general terms, apart from some aspects on which the Committee on Fisheries, in agreement with the Council, has corrected the Commission in order to avoid excess discretion, we support the fundamental aspects of this proposal, the objective of which is for there to be a single framework for the Community system of authorisations for vessels operating outside Community waters."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is therefore going to vote against the amendments already rejected by the Committee on Fisheries that have been tabled again with 40 signatures, which go precisely in the opposite direction, in that they insist that agreements on exchanges of quotas should remain outside the general legislation on licences to fish."
"In my opinion, given that the Court of Auditors' report on the shortcomings of the control policy is still making the headlines and it has been decided to tackle once and for all the fight against illegal fishing, it is not very acceptable to claim that some agreements should continue to be outside a general framework that is very necessary as a basic legal guarantee of equal and non-discriminatory treatment, both among operators and among Member States."
"It should also be pointed out that we are immersed in working on an integrated and coordinated focus for the different Community policies, in particular maritime policy, a focus that Parliament has fully supported, as well as the even more necessary process of simplifying Community legislation."
"In this respect, it should not be forgotten that we are talking about more than 9 000 vessels that operate under the different agreements and regional fisheries organisations, which means processing more than 16 000 fishing authorisations, as no agreement, in either the North or the South, is exempt from this obligation."
"If it is time for anything, then, it is time to harmonise and simplify a framework to make it as standardised as possible and not to continue creating differences that only make monitoring difficult and generate mistrust of the rules."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Morillon report on fishing authorisations - or I should say the ex-Stihler report."
"As the original rapporteur, I was compelled to remove my name from the report when the Committee on Fisheries rejected my key amendments."
"The report was supposed to simplify fishing authorisations."
"Instead, the Commission over-reached itself with an unnecessary article awarding itself the right to reallocate fishing quotas."
"If supported unamended, this report will unjustly discriminate against northern countries and their historic fishing rights and jeopardise relative stability."
"To give the Commission carte blanche to reallocate fishing opportunities beggars belief, especially when fishing opportunities are scarcer."
"We have to ask ourselves whether we are facing a fishing free-for-all in the North Sea."
"This is not in the interests of Scottish fishermen, nor is it in the interests of protecting and conserving stocks."
"The next review of the common fisheries policy is due by 2012 and this report is a wake-up call that historic fishing rights are under threat in the North and Baltic Seas."
"I have retabled key amendments for the plenary and urge colleagues to support them."
"If these amendments are defeated, I urge voting against this report."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Morillon on taking over this report on behalf of the committee, but I really have to commiserate with Ms Stihler, because she did a lot of work and then, as we heard, she had to withdraw her name from the report."
"That is always a great cause for frustration, after a rapporteur has put a great deal of hard work into the preparation of a complex bit of work like this."
"But I can well understand her reasons for doing so."
"While few in this Parliament would argue with any proposal that seeks to enhance fisheries compliance, it is of major concern to me that Article 13 of the report, which deals with under-utilisation of fisheries opportunities, will simply provide the Commission with the right to reallocate fishing opportunities from one Member State to another."
"This would clearly undermine the entire concept of relative stability and as such would destabilise one of the core principles of the common fisheries policy."
"In fact, Article 13 is something of a Trojan horse, as it seems to have more to do with gaining access to fishing opportunities previously allocated to other Member States than with reducing bureaucracy and red tape and improving compliance, which I thought the report was all about."
"I know that in the Fisheries Council the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark have all expressed similar concerns, so, as Ms Stihler said, this is a resurrection of the old North-South divide, which I thought had disappeared long ago, and that is something that we do not want to see coming back."
"I very much hope - contrary to what Commissioner Borg told us in his earlier remarks - that tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of Amendments 20, 21, 22 and 23, tabled by Ms Stihler and signed by 40 MEPs."
"(ES) Thank you, Madam President."
"Mr Stevenson, I am sure that we are going to vote against the amendments that you have just mentioned, and I do not have any doubt that this North-South situation is completely new to you."
"So far you have only experienced the situation in the North and we have experienced the situation in the South."
"We would now like to experience something of the situation in the North, because it seems to us that it works well for you in the North, and therefore those of us in the South would like to share some of it."
"I would firstly like to congratulate the Commission for agreeing to simplify the text of the proposal as it is true that the first version had some elements that were difficult to accept."
"The review of the control Regulation, the Agreement with Greenland and something that the Commissioner mentioned, the proposal for a Regulation on IUU fishing, all enable the scope of this proposal to be limited."
"I am sure that tomorrow my group will, as it did in committee, vote against those amendments that aim to avoid the adoption of a general mechanism for using surplus fishing opportunities, something that we have always advocated, just as we have always been in favour of the need to have a uniform system for using surplus fishing opportunities that applies to all agreements, not just to southern agreements, which was the Council's commitment when it ratified the Partnership Agreement with Greenland."
"Consequently, I think that I can say that my group will vote against those amendments that are an attempt to make this system apply only to southern agreements and not to northern agreements."
"Therefore I think that we are going to apply it to all of them, so all of us will feel more comfortable."
"Regarding Article 12, we agree with there being an interim procedure for allocating licences before the Council adopts the decision ratifying the agreement, for and we think that a legal solution needs to be found this issue."
"We therefore agree with the Commission on the need to have a mechanism that ensures that fishing opportunities are not put at risk, as stated in Article 12, if the process of ratifying a fisheries agreement has not been completed."
"Madam President, according to the Commission, the aim of this proposal is to serve the objectives of the common fisheries policy and to allow the Community to better ensure compliance with its international obligations."
"The Community fishing fleet is active in the territorial waters of around 20 countries under the scope of bilateral agreements."
"But as we seek to manage our fisheries sustainably by limiting fishing in the European Community waters, we should be careful not to export the problem of over-fishing by handing out authorisations for vessels to freely exploit waters of third countries."
"As I pointed out to Commissioner Borg only last month, we must pay particular attention to our international moral obligations to Africa."
"Unsustainable exploitation of marine resources in Africa's oceans on a massive scale is causing the collapse of fisheries, the loss of critical ecosystems and the extinction of marine wild life."
"A large part of the problem is unreported illegal and unregulated fishing by the EU and other fishing companies."
"In 2005 alone an estimated 40% of fish were caught without licence or in violation of regulations in the waters of Guinea-Bissau."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all on the issue of the inclusion of overseas countries and territories, I wish to clarify that the regulation does not apply to them, since the scope of the proposal does not cover vessels flagged with overseas countries and territories."
"However, it does apply to the outermost regions, which are considered Community waters."
"I agree with those who have supported this proposal as it stands, with its wide scope in order to make all agreements more effective and to ensure more value for money, in line with the overall objectives set by the Committee on Fisheries itself and others, like the Court of Auditors."
"On the amendments, let me again say that some of the amendments are accepted, as I indicated."
"Others have been overtaken by virtue of the first Presidency compromise text or because the proposed amendments are already provided for elsewhere in the regulation or in some other legal provisions."
"I would like to repeat that all fisheries agreements under which Community vessels fish are to be included in the scope of the proposal."
"This is essential, because the states party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, as I said before, are responsible for the vessels flying their flags."
"Secondly, the reallocation of under-utilised fishing opportunities is there to optimise utilisation of fishing opportunities under the fisheries agreements."
"This is, after all, only proper management of fisheries agreements and it will not undermine relative stability, given that Article 13(6) of the proposal states the following: 'Transmission of applications in accordance with this article shall not in any way affect the future allocation of fishing opportunities amongst Member States.'"
"So it will be a reallocation to maximise the fishing opportunities granted or available under fishing agreements and not a means whereby a precedent would be set which would undermine relative stability."
"Finally, I would also like to say that this provision is becoming a regular feature of fisheries partnership agreements with third countries and it has also been included, with the agreement of the Council, in the Greenland agreement."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, I will probably not need all that time to say that this debate will have been worthwhile and that the fact that some of our colleagues have tabled amendments despite the nearly unanimous vote, made it possible."
"You will have realised, Commissioner, that there are two concerns on this matter."
"You replied in part to the first concern expressed, which is the maintenance of relative stability."
"That is the purpose of amendments 20 to 24 tabled by our colleagues."
"The second concern is the one expressed by Mrs Stihler, namely that with this revision of the regulation, there could be unreasonable exploitation of fish stocks, in particular the fish stocks of third countries."
"Some of my fellow Members here have echoed this and that is why they signed."
"I think I can say, regarding this, that there is nothing in the text of the report that will be voted on tomorrow that could give rise to this concern, but it is up to our fellow Members tomorrow to decide because I think, Madam President, that you are going to announce that this report will be put to the vote tomorrow."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 10 April 2008."
"Rights-based management tools in fisheries (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Attwooll on rights-based management tools in fisheries."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, my thanks are due to the shadow rapporteurs and all on the Fisheries Committee for producing a well-balanced report on what is a very complex and in many ways sensitive issue."
"In some public debate, rights-based management is equated with the employment of individual transferable quotas."
"The report takes a much broader view, treating the term as covering any of the forms that can be taken by the right to harvest fish, given that these are seen as a common public good."
"So understood, it is clear that there is a variety of such forms currently in operation throughout the EU."
"For example, the extent of the right may be specified by reference to the territory to be fished, the amount of fish to be harvested, the effort allowed or some mixture of these."
"Similarly, although the right is implicitly transferable, there are various limitations in this respect."
"For example, that from Community to Member States is conditioned by the principle of relative stability."
"Further, there seems to be a considerable range of such limitations."
"One particular form of divergence between Member States is how far transfer for economic value is permitted, either formally or informally, and thus amounts to a tradable right."
"The central issue is, then, how fisheries management should engage in constituting the right to harvest in order best to obtain the objectives of the common fisheries policy."
"The Commission communication raises the question of the extent to which a single system might be introduced, either at Community level or by harmonising the practice of Member States."
"The report of the Fisheries Committee details a number of concerns about the adverse impacts that certain types of rights-based management might have, but also touches on the manner in which some of these might be prevented."
"It indicates too the way in which certain types of rights-based management can have positive effects, provided they are properly devised."
"The report notes the variety of systems of rights-based management currently in place, the degree to which the forms of right concerned are hybrid ones and the complexity of the issues involved."
"It is consequently rightly cautious about the idea of moving to any single system."
"Over and above the need to protect artisanal fleets, we raise the question of whether, on a more general basis, the same system would be appropriate for both single species and multi-species fisheries."
"We finish by asking the Commission to address a number of different questions in its study and, in view of all that needs to be taken into consideration, to allow a longer time for debate."
"In conclusion, I would like to touch more deeply on one aspect of the report."
"Although rights-based management is essentially a juristic concept, I have the impression that much of the drive towards its discussion has come from economists."
"I do not think that anyone here would doubt that fisheries management must take account of sound economic principles."
"Indeed the report indicates some of the positive outcomes to which economic efficiency may give rise."
"But such efficiency has to be seen as an instrumental good."
"As the report states, it is valuable insofar as it promotes the objectives of the CFP."
"I have personal doubts that economic efficiency is sufficient, in itself, to promote all these objectives to the desired extent and suspect that there are ways in which it may prove counterproductive to some aspects of them."
"I seek reassurance, therefore, that the Commission will take a genuinely rounded approach, both in relation to the content and to the outcome of the study."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur, Ms Attwooll, and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for a very thorough report, the contents of which I can almost fully endorse."
"The report recognises the main advantage of rights-based management systems as being increased economic rationale in fisheries."
"This is a crucial issue in the present context, where poor economic performance is the rule rather than the exception."
"The quest for a higher degree of economic efficiency generally has very positive effects on overcapacity and hence on sustainability of fisheries activities."
"The report, however, also accurately identifies the possible negative effects."
"In my opinion, such effects could be contained, if not eliminated, by introducing provisions intended to limit concentration of rights, to deal with allocation issues and, as proposed by the report, to protect artisanal fleets."
"These are being dealt with by various means in third countries where rights-based management systems in general, and individual transferable quotas in particular, have been in place for quite some time."
"As stated in the report, such systems are a complex matter, but difficulties associated with them are not insurmountable."
"On balance, I think the possible benefits are larger than the possible negative effects."
"However, I would like to confirm once more that the Commission has no intention of proposing Community management systems."
"Nor is it the Commission's intention to promote a given and universal rights-based management system."
"Different fisheries will require different systems. I am also fully aware of the sensitivity of this issue in relation to relative stability."
"The Commission will continue working on this issue."
"In the short term, we are aiming at increasing the general knowledge on rights-based management and identifying best practices to be shared with Member States' national or regional governments with fisheries competences."
"We will also consider issuing guidelines or similar supporting documents to that effect."
"The results of the consultation process - including, of course, the report of the European Parliament - and the outcome of the ongoing study on rights-based management systems in the Member States and experiences in third countries will be important inputs for this process."
"In the medium term, rights-based management is going to be one of the topics in our reflection towards the next reform of the common fisheries policy."
"The Commission will keep you informed about these future developments and I look forward to further fruitful discussions with you on this important issue."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Madam President, more than 10 years ago, Parliament considered the possibility of introducing fishing rights into the CFP, through an own-initiative report on the future review of the CFP."
"We can therefore only express our satisfaction at the Commission's decision to finally examine the possibilities of this fisheries management tool, although in my opinion, in a too simplistic and superficial way, undoubtedly due to a fear of unleashing the fury of the Council regarding these matters."
"Those who are the most resistant to change and the least enterprising, both in the fisheries sector and in the Council, have always feared any change to management systems, even for the better."
"This does not mean that these sectors and Member States are in a better situation, or even in the same situation as they were 30 years ago, but rather they are dragging the more dynamic sectors towards a dead end."
"It is true that management through the allocation of fishing rights raises questions with regard to implementation, but it is just as true that countries in which fishing is an important sector for the future have been able to resolve them, demonstrating that, at least for parts of the fleet that are able to evolve towards more modern, efficient and sustainable approaches, it has advantages that are far from negligible."
"We therefore also welcome Mrs Attwooll's report, which, alongside the concerns, has succeeded in reflecting the possible advantages, which could include improvements in control, a reduction in capacity, a decrease in discards and lower dependency on public aid."
"I would like to say to Mrs Attwooll that fishing is indeed an economic activity, and one that needs to be profitable, which is now ceasing to be the case, therefore perhaps we need more economists in fisheries than there are at present, to analyse these issues in more detail."
"Having said this, I wish the Commission great success in this debate and I hope that the management model, which has been a failure, can be changed in the future."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) I should like to congratulate Mrs Attwooll for her hard work to achieve the maximum possible consensus on her report."
"This is a complex and controversial issue but it is extremely important for all who are concerned about the sustainability of resources, and this includes the sustainability of the most precious resource for all who make up Europe's innumerable fishing communities."
"I therefore think that the report strikes exactly the right balance between the different points of view."
"The results of the vote in the Committee on Fisheries - 21 in favour out of 24 - bears out what I have just said."
"It is important not to avoid this debate but equally important not to decide too hastily."
"As a Member elected for a Member State where the small-scale and multi-species fisheries which predominate in the south of Europe are very important, I am concerned about the introduction of management systems involving trade in fishing rights, which might bring benefits for shipowners with greater purchasing power to the detriment of smaller shipowners."
"I also fear that the general adoption of such a system might be counter-productive, possibly even leading to higher catches to offset the cost of acquiring the fishing right."
"I therefore repeat that I support the overall conclusions of the report, to the effect that no decisions should be adopted until we have studies covering all Member States and the different types of fisheries plus a wide-ranging debate to assess all the variables involved in this issue."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) I should like to begin by paying tribute to the commitment of the rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, in drawing up a balanced report on a question as fundamental as the sovereignty of Member States in the management of their fisheries resources and the setting up of private property rights for access to and exploitation of that public good."
"However, although we appreciate paragraph 11, the report contains many points on which we totally disagree, for example, viewing this debate as an anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy or including points that more or less explicitly argue for adopting fishing right management mechanisms at Community level."
"In our view, each Member State should be responsible for managing its marine resources, in particular as a way of safeguarding its food sovereignty."
"We therefore reject any step-by-step process that could, in future, lead to the setting up of a rights-based management system in Community fisheries, that is the marketing of fishing licences, days at sea or quotas, which would inevitably lead to the appropriation and concentration in private hands of a public good."
"Madam President, this is a complex area and I certainly commend Ms Attwooll for her report and her efforts in that regard."
"Representing a region whose overall experience of the common fisheries policy has been far from positive, I must say that my natural inclination is strongly against the imposition of any EU-based management system."
"Rather, I am quite clear that Member States should be able to decide what management system works best for them."
"Moreover, maintaining stability, I fear, could be severely jeopardised in the industry if unregulated transferable quotas were embraced, with particular threat to single and small-scale operators."
"It would be better by far in my book to repatriate real powers over fishing to Member States and concentrate on getting in place viable local management systems capable of enjoying the confidence of those affected."
"I also fear that this new study will prove to be another protracted excuse for putting off real and helpful change."
"I hope that does not prove to be so, but we have seen that in the past."
"(PT) I would also like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, and to say that, in my opinion, the natural marine heritage should be preserved and should be used in a sustainable manner by the fishing communities whose lives are traditionally bound up with that environment; it cannot be regarded as just another business."
"I therefore do not share the vision of marine ecosystems and the associated fishing communities as a market, where fishing rights may be freely traded, perhaps even on a kind of stock market, which would naturally lead to the industrialisation of fishing and pose a threat to the equilibrium of the ecosystems and fishing communities."
"Even more, it seems to me that we simply must not allow anything to jeopardise the principle of relative stability and I therefore think that the Commission should be as cautious as possible in this debate."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Attwooll for her work and welcome this report as it has initiated a much-needed debate on alternative management measures."
"I strongly agree with the report when it points out that the current fisheries management systems within the EU, specifically in the area of TACs and quotas, do not provide an answer to our problems, and that it is necessary to hold a wide-ranging debate."
"In its green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy, the Commission states that: 'Alternative management mechanisms can play a significant complementary role in Community fisheries management.'"
"However, I would venture to suggest that alternative management measures should and must play a compulsory role in the future, as we need to take on board a range of factors, including climate change and up-to-date marine and fisheries research based on sound science."
"As I pointed out in my now redundant opinion of the Committee on Fisheries for the report by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, I have no doubt that climate change will impact on EU fisheries regulations, as allocations of quotas based on historic catch patterns will need to be revised as a result of the shifting distribution of fish stocks."
"Furthermore, fisheries management will have to be increasingly based on adaptive approaches as historical data will be less valuable."
"As climate change and other factors increasingly impact on our fish stocks, our management will need the necessary flexibility, based on sound peer-reviewed science, to adapt to the new conditions and ensure sustainability of resources."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I think that we all share a common objective: that of achieving a balance between the economic efficiency of such systems but, at the same time, protecting small fisheries."
"I agree with what the rapporteur said, namely that fisheries cannot be looked at purely in economic terms."
"I need to stress here that the subject is far from simple."
"I certainly agree that such systems are a complex matter."
"As I said before, we have to take into account in our reflections possible limitations on the concentration of rights, the resolution of allocation issues and measures for the protection of artisanal fisheries, and we have to approach this matter gradually."
"In the short term, we need to learn more, we need to identify best practices and we need to study where rights-based managements systems have operated successfully in certain Member States and look at experiences in third countries."
"All this will clearly be an important issue for discussion in the context of the next reform."
"I certainly look forward to the input from the Committee on Fisheries on this issue."
"I have noted all the comments made by all the parliamentarians who have spoken on this subject."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I cannot say that I am altogether reassured by the Commissioner's response, because it seemed to me that, in what he was saying, he was actually giving pre-eminence to one particular form of rights-based management, whereas what the report is seeking is a review of all different types of forms to assess their merits and demerits."
"I think we are all agreed that the common fisheries policy is in need of reform."
"A newspaper in my constituency that picked up the European Parliament press release on the report cites me as being cautious about the reform of the CFP."
"This is certainly not so if it is taken to mean that I have any doubts about the need for reform."
"I am cautious, as I think we all are, to the extent of wanting to be reassured that the reform is in the right direction."
"In the course of writing the report, for example, it occurred to me to ask just how compatible with one another the different ways of defining the extent of the right to fish are."
"My feeling was that, whilst quota and effort limitations both combine readily with territorial restrictions, neither of the first two sits that comfortably with the other."
"This in turn made me realise that, technical though a report on rights-based management might, on the face of it, seem, the issue it raises goes to the very heart of the common fisheries policy."
"Whilst generally applauding the direction of current reform, I hope that the discussion may trigger a more radical reappraisal of the tools we use, so as to achieve the best possible balance between improving the livelihood of those engaged in fisheries, having a sustainable marine ecology in which fish stocks are conserved and maintaining the viability of fisheries-dependent communities."
"I would not like to think that, in advance of a thorough study, some prior decision had been taken as to what might achieve the very best balance."
"2009 budget guidelines - (sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII et IX) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Lewandowski on the 2009 budget guidelines - (sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII and IX)."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, today, with the adoption and discussion of the guidelines, and tomorrow, with the vote on the Guidelines for 2009, we are taking the first step in a budget procedure that departs from the pattern of previous years in at least two ways."
"The first departure is that we are testing a new cooperation formula between Parliament's administration and the Committee on Budgets; we are treating this as a pilot project, but this should comply with the generally binding principles for the budget procedure following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Secondly, 2009 brings new challenges, which no-one is questioning."
"One such challenge is certainly the likely entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, and with it a fundamental enhancement of powers of the European Parliament's codecision, the paving of the way for Parliament's activities as a genuine legislative body."
"Secondly, this is an election year, so there will be costs linked to the election campaign and certain costs - besides the obvious savings - linked to the end of the current parliamentary term."
"Thirdly, the Statute for Members will come into effect, which will increase the personal cost burden, the burden of our costs in the European Parliament budget."
"In many of these matters we already have certain quantifications, certain calculations since, in parallel with the principles, we are getting to know the forecasts, the first budget preliminaries for 2009."
"In the most important area, however - in other words, in the area associated with the increase in the powers of the European Parliament following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon - we have got as far as a working group, which will establish the extra costs that may be associated with this."
"Recognising the specific challenges that await us in 2009, we cannot at the same time exempt ourselves from the duty of frugal management of European taxpayers' money, i.e. from certain self-imposed restrictions which we shall also expect from other European institutions."
"Proliferation of the administration in an election year is certainly not the message that the European electorate wants to hear - the electorate to whom we are turning for a renewal of the European Parliament's mandate."
"A further essential aspect of the guidelines is internal obligations, to look for opportunities for what is referred to as the redeployment of existing human resources, not to increase staff numbers, and to concentrate on those functions that will mark out the future of the European Parliament, which we define using the term 'correctivity', and which are associated with legislation."
"Today we must also discuss, and we should discuss, an issue that has a certain media resonance and that clearly also has extra-budgetary dimensions."
"What we need are three new regulations in parallel."
"The first is the introduction of a Statute for Members, with a distinct budgetary dimension; the second is new pension fund principles; and the third is employment rules for assistants, which must be transparent enough not to arouse temptations, and not to arouse suspicions surrounding the European Parliament."
"As rapporteur I propose that this material be referred specifically to our Parliament's resolution of 25 October 2007 and to the unanimous decisions of the Praesidium and the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament."
"I know that at present our curiosity is being stirred more by the calculations than by the guidelines, and so I am counting on this document being smoothly voted through tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE group. - (RO) The budgetary orientations of our institution for the year 2009 represent the document based on which the budget of the European Parliament will be established this autumn."
"Nevertheless, beyond the amounts and programmes, this year's budgetary orientations bring to discussion an issue I consider very important: the legal situation of the European Parliament assistants."
"I would like to thank Mr Lewandowski for having approached this subject as well."
"I believe the time has come for the old system to become clearer and more transparent and to provide these young people with social and fiscal rights equal to the rights of the other members of the institution's staff. For the latter, there are the Staff Regulations of the European Communities, a very comprehensive document, which provides the staff working in the European Union institutions with adequate social protection."
"Most of the parliamentary assistants are also foreign citizens in relation to the country where they carry out their activity and, consequently, they should enjoy the protection provided to all workers in international organizations."
"I don't think it is normal to have cases in which the Belgian state imposes additional tax liabilities on assistants, taking into account that they pay all due taxes and contributions to social insurances in their country of nationality."
"Still, the Parliament needs clear regulations for assistants as regards situations such as disease or maternity as well."
"In several resolutions, the European Parliament has already requested the Secretary General and the working group on the Members' Statute and Assistants and Pension Fund to draw up a new set of rules that would solve the problems the assistants are currently dealing with."
"I believe it is our responsibility toward the European citizens to have only clear and transparent rules in this institution."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Madam President, the European Parliament's budget for 2009 will be a very special one, as this Parliament will have codecision in almost all areas for the first time if the new Treaty enters into force in 2009."
"The Treaty of Lisbon achieves what our predecessors were already calling for more than 50 years ago without obtaining it: not just advisory powers, not just assent procedures, but codecision and democratic control by this Parliament over nearly all of Brussels's policy areas."
"The inclination to call for more staff is therefore great."
"Codecision means a more difficult procedure in each committee, but it does not mean double the workload."
"This budget therefore remains cautious, and that is good."
"Where additional staff are needed, redeployment is attempted."
"Few new staff will be employed - indeed, that would be hard to justify with almost 6 000 employees."
"The work of this Parliament must indeed be made more visible."
"Web-TV is to be launched after the summer and, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I hope that the editorial team enjoys a position of independence, with full freedom to show the debates held here."
"We owe our voters that openness."
"What we also owe our voters is full verifiability of our expenditure, and good management of human resources."
"Assistants must have a proper contract, with the social security and pension provision usual in each European institution."
"At least 1 in 10 members of staff are working here without any social protection."
"This has to change."
"A statute for employees must be brought in, preferably by the end of this year, and it is incredible that there are attempts to oppose this, to oppose the social spirit, the spirit of solidarity, of the European Union, from the ranks of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats."
"Further work will have to be done on long-term strategies, regarding for example the purchase of buildings and technological innovation."
"The Statute for Members also has an impact on the budget."
"Subsidies to the Sakharov Foundation in Moscow must be no more than one-off cases, nor is it the primary role of this House to finance museums of European history; such expenditure must be borne by the European budget."
"Further debate is needed on this."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Lewandowski, for a good report, and also by expressing my satisfaction with the new procedure and the more open dialogue and early briefing of the committee that has been evident."
"As several in this House have remarked, 2009 is a special year."
"Even though the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been ratified in all countries, we have to take account, in our budgeting, of its entry into force in 2009."
"The European Parliament's new powers - giving it, for example, influence over the agricultural budget and over legal policy - will mean adjusting some of its priorities to cope with the new responsibilities."
"Then there are the elections to the European Parliament and the Statute for Members, which also have an impact on the budget."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is content with Parliament's draft budget remaining within 20% of EU administrative expenditure."
"There is no guarantee that this will be feasible in the next few years, but it is important that we hold administrative expenditure in check."
"I should also like to express the ALDE Group's great satisfaction with the emergence of a new model for the remuneration of Members' assistants."
"Our group has wanted to see a statute for Members' assistants for a long time. It is the right solution for Parliament to take over the administration, and this is reflected in the 2009 budget."
"Considerable savings have been achieved from the sale of buildings over the last 10 years, but I agree that we have now reached a point at which this policy must be revised, and that the buildings policy in general should undergo a service."
"We have yet to see a proposal for the other institutions, but there is cause to keep a watchful eye on the growing buildings expenditure of those, too."
"Finally, the issue of the financing of the future EU Minister of Foreign Affairs and the President of the European Council remains important, but we shall come back to that later."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the guidelines for the 2009 budget procedure presented by the rapporteur, Mr Lewandowski, relate principally to the European Parliament, and have the potential to apply to other sections."
"In view of the financial restrictions that have been adopted and the immensity of the new tasks linked to the Treaty of Lisbon, the elections to Parliament, the change in the Statute for Members and the proposed introduction of a statute for assistants, 2009 will be a very difficult year."
"There are a lot of unknowns, so the most important matter will be implementation of the guidelines."
"Detailed analyses of needs and the associated cost analyses will enable us to keep within the financial framework and at the same time should ensure that Parliament functions smoothly and that the new tasks can be handled."
"Our political group will be voting in favour of the report."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, 2009 is the year of new things, and therefore of uncertainties and dangers."
"It will require all the talent of our rapporteur, the former chairman of the Committee on Budgets, to meet this challenge."
"A new Treaty that is going to double the scope of Parliament's codecision."
"Imagine the effort that will be needed for this, particularly in budgetary terms."
"A new Statute for Members."
"Totally unknown at present: which countries are going to allow their future elected representatives to fall into this new system, and which elected representatives are going to want to do so?"
"An election campaign, a new code of practice, particularly for assistants."
"I have been asking the Bureau for this for nearly ten years and I am delighted to see that this dossier is finally ready."
"It is quite simple though, since we are all aware of the package that will not cost taxpayers a penny: putting assistants on a Community footing, for those working in Brussels, and those who pay them directly under Parliament's control, for those working in the constituencies."
"There should be a constant budget for this because honesty does not cost a penny, just a little political effort."
"I am also passionately in favour of new working methods, particularly on buildings issues, because like many of my fellow Members, I am always surprised after a call for tenders at how astonishingly high construction costs are when it comes to building work by the European institutions."
"If we really want to make savings, perhaps it is not necessary to translate everything I have just said into Maltese, Latvian and Hungarian, because in eight months' time it will not be read by anybody and that would save EUR 17 million per year."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Madam President, Mr Lewandowski's report presents a calm view of the size of Parliament's budget."
"The Social Democrats and Greens have quite unnecessarily proposed amendments which would mean a less controlled way of spending money."
"The view taken in the report on the 'House of European History' is along the right lines when the rapporteur states that it is not for Parliament to finance such a project, even though it is the idea of the current President."
"The report also adopts a position on the Commission's budget."
"The comment is made that its administrative expenditure does not extend to some 2 000 employees, who are outsourced for employment in its agencies."
"This expenditure is excluded from the total sum, from which 20% is deducted for Parliament's use."
"Parliament cannot outsource its operations in the same way, and it also has to finance support for the pan-European political parties out of its own budget."
"(SK) I agree with the view of the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets that when preparing the European Parliament's budget for 2009 the priority is to take into account Parliament's more extensive duties after ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"In particular, there is the European Parliament's new role of sharing law-making equally with the Council of the European Union."
"Although the transition from the consultation procedure to the codecision procedure will not necessarily mean doubling the workload of the parliamentary committees, we have to remember that the increase in codecision powers will be unprecedented, and that Parliament will assume responsibilities for producing legislative acts."
"The European Parliament's political priorities must therefore be properly funded."
"Of course we have to try to save money wherever possible but only under the condition that the budget continues to be adequate."
"(FR) Madam President, in Mr Lewandowski's very comprehensive report, I was particularly interested in the Parliament budget for this election year, which has consequences for the institution's communications policy."
"Improving communication to European citizens was one of Parliament's priorities for 2009."
"For them to feel more involved in the forthcoming elections and to get the highest possible turnout, it is important for MEPs to be closely associated with a decentralised information campaign in the Member States."
"We also hope that local media will be fully integrated into this campaign because they play a key role in passing on information."
"Parliament's communication budget and the actions planned for 2009 should therefore make sure that they interest and directly affect European citizens, who often feel that the European institutions are too detached."
"Note that generally speaking these actions follow on from those begun and funded in 2008."
"We also hope that the new visitor centre and the web TV will soon be operational to provide better information on Parliament's activities and to improve the relationship between citizens and the European Union."
"(LV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in preparing the European Parliament's budget for 2009, the issue of the total budget expenditure ceiling and whether it should not exceed 20% of total EU administrative expenditure has once again come to the fore."
"I would, however, like to endorse the approach taken by the rapporteur, namely that the European Parliament's level of expenditure should be based on requirements that are justified following careful evaluation."
"Certainly, 2009 will bring significant changes to the European Parliament's work."
"With the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, the volume of legislative work will increase considerably, and the change in the system of remuneration for MEPs will give rise to additional costs, as will the publicity campaign in connection with the European Parliament elections."
"By focusing on the main spheres of activity, however, and carefully analysing the budget requests, as well as evaluating the possibilities for re-allocating officials internally before creating new permanent posts, it is possible to keep the level of expenditure in the European Parliament's budget within the 20% limit."
"All opportunities to reduce inappropriate paper and energy consumption at the European Parliament have not yet been exhausted."
"I am pleased with the support given last year to the proposal to reduce the circulation of paper versions of individual documents, stipulating that paper versions of these documents be accessible on request, instead of automatically being distributed to all Members and officials."
"Implementation of this proposal is making it possible to save over three million sheets of paper a year."
"This principle can be applied to many more types of document."
"Regarding the European Parliament's budget for next year, the issue of expenditure on Members' assistants cannot be overlooked, and I therefore call upon the working group set up by the European Parliament's Bureau to come forward with proposals to make the payment of these costs more transparent and more easy to monitor. Thank you for your attention."
"(PL) Madam President, there are three issues in this debate to which I would like to draw attention."
"Firstly, the level of inflation in individual EU countries is rising sharply, and as a result the average level of inflation across the EU will be around 4% in 2008, so indexing expenditure at 2% annually actually means a fall in expenditure."
"Secondly, one consequence of adopting the Treaty of Lisbon will be a marked increase in the powers of the European Parliament, the codecision procedure in all areas, and also the powers of the Member States' parliaments, which will cause a sharp increase in the European Parliament's functioning costs."
"Thirdly and finally, 2009 is a year of European Parliament elections."
"So far the turnout for these elections has been exceptionally low, particularly in the new Member States."
"Additional expenditure is therefore needed for an information campaign aimed chiefly at regional and local media, through which the electorate can be most effectively reached."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take the opportunity to canvass support for the amendment by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats on the secretarial allowance."
"I know that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have tabled another amendment; ours has the same wording as the decisions of the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents, which all group chairs voted unanimously to support."
"I do not actually think it fair what is now being said about the Committee on Budgets living up to its reputation of doing its own thing again."
"The amendment by the Verts/ALE Group talks of a statute for Members' assistants."
"This will be the result if the Bureau's amendment, that is, the result of the negotiations with the Council, become available."
"We, too, are striving for this statute for Members' assistants, but we do not yet know whether we shall obtain it, whether we can even come to an agreement with the Council."
"I should therefore like to request that this phrase not result in the rejection of all the Bureau's wording."
"I think it is very important that we proceed in this House with as much agreement as possible and do not needlessly quarrel over details we do not have the power to establish."
"Hence my heartfelt plea to endorse our amendment."
"Not a single word has been added or left out."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, I would like to offer my thanks to all those who took part in the debate."
"The problem that arose most often in this debate, apart from the specific challenges of 2009 and the need to manage European taxpayers' money frugally, was definitely the problem of Members' assistants."
"I want to avoid the manner in which this problem is resolved becoming a battlefield for rival political groups, as all groups in our Parliament are united by an awareness of the need to resolve this problem in a way that removes the temptation to engage in corruption and the suspicions that surround this matter, while at the same time taking into account the heterogeneity of the 27 countries that make up the European Union."
"I would like to reassure my fellow Member Mr Kuźmiuk that expenditure is set to rise by 4.8%, so probably by more than the level of European inflation."
"Meanwhile, may I wish Mrs Gräßle success in completing her reports before midnight."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 10 April 2008."
"in writing. - (FR) I should first like to acknowledge the excellent work of my Polish colleague Mr Lewandowski on the 2009 budget guidelines of the 'other institutions', namely the European Parliament but also the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"This document runs through the main challenges that will be on Parliament's agenda for 2009, particularly the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Everything must be done to ensure that Parliament's enhanced responsibilities following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon are taken into account in the budget."
"However, I wonder whether, prior to the budget procedures, an audit should be carried out of the human resources allocated to the European Parliament's activities."
"The European Parliament's political leaders are becoming increasingly important and it is essential that MEPs have the means to work in complete independence."
"It would seem that the resources currently allocated are no longer a match for the broader political responsibilities that the European Parliament is having to and, in future, will have to take on to represent European citizens properly."
"Amendment of regulation on a standard financial regulation for executive agencies - Framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (debate)"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission thanks Parliament, and, in particular, the rapporteur, for his constructive approach."
"The Commission is entirely committed to providing for full transparency vis-à-vis the budgetary authority as requested today by Parliament and in line with the joint statements of the European Parliament and the Council of July 2007."
"In particular, as regards the decentralised agencies, the Commission will insert in the regulation accrued information requirements concerning the number of contract staff, operating surpluses, assigned revenue, transfers and waivers to recoveries."
"More transparency of information on the work of the agencies, and not only in financial and budgetary matters, is also a concern recently expressed by the Commission in a communication to Parliament and the Council."
"At this point, let me recall the Commission's proposal to set up an interinstitutional group to engage in a political discussion on the role and place of agencies in European governance, both with the Parliament and with the Council."
"The Commission is indeed convinced that, if we have a consistent approach to agencies, we - all three institutions - can promote the transparency and effectiveness of an important part of the European Union's architecture."
"This is why I would like to conclude by expressing the wish that the interinstitutional working group proposed by the Commission starts its work soon."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the opportunity to speak here even at this late hour, and thank you all for your understanding."
"I requested permission to speak here."
"I am speaking for the Commissioner's sole benefit, as I think it is important to tell the Commission that we consider the amendments we have tabled, on which we shall also be voting tomorrow with a very large majority, to be important."
"I wish to tell him that we are only at the consultation stage with this dossier, and I should like to assure him on behalf of the whole Parliament that our amendments will help to bring greater order into the agency system."
"It is therefore very important to us all across the group divide that the Commission take them on board."
"I am obliged to the Commissioner for his assurances in this regard, and I shall also be monitoring the situation."
"It is very important to me that he also understand why we want this."
"We need better accountability in the agencies and greater transparency, particularly among staff members."
"This concerns our budgetary law most directly."
"The Commissioner will also be aware, of course, that if our wishes are not taken on board we shall find our own ways to fulfil them."
"We regard this essential to our budgetary law."
"The Commission had originally intended the present reform of the Financial Regulation to consist of merely technical modifications."
"We talk of better regulation, yet I have noted with great sorrow that the latest joint decision on agencies by the Council and Parliament in July has not been incorporated."
"The Commission's draft came somewhat earlier, but it would have been nice, of course, if it had been subsequently reworked."
"I should have also thought this fairer than leaving the work to us."
"The European Parliament has introduced political changes with great unanimity right across the group divide."
"We want to bring internal operations, responsibilities, transfers of appropriations and accountability of agencies more into line with the operations and practice of the Commission Directorate-General by means of a declaration of assurance."
"We also want a better overview of the personnel and financial costs of the agencies."
"We want to be informed of all employees and not just those on the establishment plan."
"This is an absolute necessity."
"I should like to give an example from a recent report by a decentralised agency on financial management in 2007."
"Thirty-nine posts are listed on this establishment plan, whereas 43 temporary staff and 11 contract staff appear in the text two pages before this."
"No two figures match, therefore."
"It is left to the reader's imagination as to whether we now have 39 plus 11 posts or 43 plus 11 plus 39, or whether the 39 posts of 43 staff are listed and the 11 are then added."
"We just do not know."
"I shall clarify the issue, but clarifying this issue for the large number of agencies is no fun, of course, and reporting and the reporting system are more or less equally chaotic in all the agencies."
"The agency I have just quoted, ENISA, is interchangeable with any other, and I should indeed like to ask why the information we are given is so full of inconsistencies."
"We also want more information on the agencies' revenue - which, thinking of Alicante, can indeed be sizeable - and we want to know what is happening to this revenue."
"I thank the Commissioner in advance for taking on board these amendments - as he has just announced his intention to do."
"Currently, we have 29 decentralised agencies with 3 914 employees on the establishment plan for 2007, with a budget of EUR 1.1 billion, EUR 559 million of which comes from the EU."
"The five executive agencies have 176 posts."
"The latest Commission communication on agencies was a very interesting one."
"The offer of a joint working group is very important."
"All three institutions must undertake to think through with each other the issue of the agencies' future and area of work."
"In Germany, the issue of agencies and the growth of agencies is in the public eye."
"The media resonance is always great."
"The reputation of the European Union is also at stake if we do not succeed in conveying to the outside world why we actually need these agencies and what role they play in the European Union."
"We should also be pleased if the Commission could prove why programme management is more efficient and better value when done by the executive agencies than by the Directorates-General."
"This is a request that those of us concerned with the budget have already put forward on a number of occasions, but has still not been backed up thus far in writing by the relevant facts and figures."
"Parliament's amendments serve to maintain an overview of the European agencies, and our urgent request to the Commission is to help us to bring more order into the agency landscape."
"As the Commissioner should know, we in Parliament trust the Commission on this issue."
"We know that this institution is our last resort, as it were, when it comes to creating order and transparency and providing a better overview in this regard."
"I should like to thank my fellow Members from the other groups, and particularly Mrs Haug, the rapporteur on agencies from the Committee on Budgets, and the two rapporteurs Mr Mulder and Mrs Herczog from the Committee on Budgetary Control for their suggestions, all of which we have taken on board."
"I therefore believe that we have put forward the proposed and desired amendments by Parliament that are most pressing at the present time."
"I beg the Commissioner also to incorporate these amendments in the corresponding draft."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would also like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Grässle, for her important work within the framework of these reports, which enhance the plans for a financial regulation for executive agencies."
"At a time when the European Parliament is set to see its prerogatives strongly reinforced within the framework of the Treaty of Lisbon, I think it is particularly important to remember what our institution's competences are, obviously as co-decider of the budget."
"This Parliament, elected by direct universal suffrage by the citizens of the EU, must be able to do more and better to control the proper use of Community funds spent, this time by the executive agencies."
"I would like very briefly to highlight four points in this report, which seem essential to me if Parliament is to be able to play its role fully and make it as easy as possible for citizens to understand our institutions."
"Firstly, I would also like to emphasise the need for better control over the use of assigned revenue."
"It seems important for the director of the agency to tell us about any transfers between titles exceeding the 10% threshold."
"Secondly I should also highlight the importance of the figures for the establishment plan, as our fellow Member has just mentioned, whether for temporary staff, contract workers, seconded national experts, etc., so that we as the budgetary authority have a clear picture of the development of the human resources budgets of the agencies."
"Thirdly, I think it is quite natural that we should be asking for a summary of the development of the agencies' budgets to be sent to the European Parliament each year, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Court of Auditors."
"Fourthly and finally, the provisions in the report concerning the harmonisation of the deadlines for the discharge procedure should also give Parliament real control of the proper execution of the budget."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to take my turn at complimenting Mrs Grässle on the excellent work she has done, and obviously the Commission for this development concerning the agencies."
"I would like to highlight the very important provisions on the internal auditing of our agencies and suggest, following on from the comment by my fellow Member a moment ago, that we could work towards a consolidation, a sort of sub-consolidation in the EU's accounts for all agencies, so that third parties and particularly MEPs, have a picture of the development of the accounting mass represented by all the agencies of the European Union."
"(PL) Madam President, in taking the floor in the debate devoted to amendment of the financial regulation for executive agencies and their offices, I would like to draw attention to two matters."
"Firstly, there should be support for the rapporteur's proposal that directors of agencies be obliged to notify the European Parliament if they have transferred funds from operational to administrative in an amount that exceeds 10% of the ceiling."
"Secondly, in view of the fact that executive agencies' functioning costs are covered by the budgets for individual programmes, the almost ten percent level of these costs has an impact."
"The failure to specify these costs in the case of the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency in particular has an impact when linked to the information that there is a shortfall of more than EUR 40bn for the projects that this agency deals with."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Mrs Gräßle on two very good reports."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday."

"The Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action' (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action' by Guido Sacconi, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change - B6-0014/2008)."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have no doubt whatsoever that it is vital for the European Parliament finally to take a thorough look at the issue of adapting to climate change, the scale of which we have in truth underestimated until now."
"The Commission's Green Paper has therefore given us a valuable opportunity to examine this subject."
"As everyone now knows, we are engaged in a very tough battle to do our best to mitigate global warming, and we are discussing a legislative package which should enable us to take a major step towards this goal."
"We are nevertheless aware that the effects of climate change are already being felt in many parts of the world, especially in the poorest areas as well as in large parts of our own continent and the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary to react by developing an appropriate policy which goes in the right direction without conflicting with the primary goal of, I repeat, reducing emissions and mitigating global warming."
"I believe some very significant progress was made in Bali from this point of view, given that it was decided to provide finance for the Global Environment Fund, specifically earmarking a share of the CDM to financing adaptation projects in developing countries."
"I have also read, if I am not mistaken, that the programme of work drawn up last week in Bangkok to follow on from Bali - Bangkok being the first major meeting since Bali - has scheduled another meeting in Bonn this June to focus specifically on the subject of adaptation."
"The reason why I have singled out this aspect, the international dimension, is that it seemed to me, when drafting the resolution adopted in the CLIM Committee and now being put before this House for its appraisal, that international cooperation was the top priority."
"The European Union must set about developing cooperation and financial, technical and scientific collaboration with the countries most in need of help, countries less well-equipped to confront the sometimes devastating effects of global warming."
"We need only think of the Pacific islands: we held a hearing which was attended by representatives from some of those countries, and they explained to us how precarious their situation already is now."
"Another priority is of course to strike a careful balance so as to preserve a dynamic link between mitigation and adaptation."
"The third priority is to stimulate research and experimentation."
"There is still insufficient know-how, given the extreme diversity of territorial situations, to properly gauge the likely effects of global warming; hence it is difficult to devise long-term policies to adapt to and prevent the most worrying developments."
"The key point over the next few years will of course be dovetailing these policies with others, which calls for political resolve on the part of all players at all levels."
"We have emphasised in particular the rethink that is needed in order to factor climate change into our cohesion policies, a rethink that must begin with the adaptation of agricultural policies and, more generally, land management policies."
"On this point I think we should back the amendment that has been tabled, calling on the Council to adopt a common position on the soil protection directive at long last."
"Finally - I think I am still within the five minutes, Mr President - I also believe it is very important to find the right balance, as it were, between European policies and action at local level."
"The principle of subsidiarity must be interpreted dynamically and not in a bureaucratic fashion."
"The extreme diversity of situations in Europe means that no single policy can be drawn up."
"We have the southern areas of Europe, of course, and also the Alpine belt, where the effects are very different and very significant."
"The various committees must therefore establish a very close one-to-one relationship with regional authorities."
"I am thinking of large-scale regional bodies such as the Alpine Convention and the Carpathian Convention, which are developing some very worthwhile initiatives and can be used as a model for international cooperation."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I hope you will tell us how work is progressing on the preparation of the White Paper, after the consultation held on the Green Paper."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to talk about the Commission's work."
"It is being developed to help us adapt to climate change in Europe and in the rest of the world."
"Very poor countries especially, without having contributed to the greenhouse effect, will nonetheless suffer the most detrimental consequences."
"Mr Sacconi mentioned that the Commission is preparing a White Paper, which is to be published in autumn 2008 as a follow-up to the Green Paper on adapting to climate change, published in June 2007."
"The main aim of the White Paper is for the EU to have an ambitious and effective strategy for limiting the effects of unavoidable climate change."
"This change has already happened."
"It will continue to take place in the coming years, despite measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which I hope we will take and will be able to agree on in Copenhagen in 2009."
"The EU will continue to play a leading role in international initiatives relating to adaptation."
"These initiatives are being developed under the aegis of the UN International Treaty."
"Meanwhile, the Commission has continued to cooperate with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and with other scientific organisations carrying out research into related fields, in order to determine the most appropriate ways for the international community to deal with the challenges pointed out in recent reports."
"The Commission welcomes the European Parliament's resolution on the Green Paper and I can tell you that it supports the greater part of it."
"I refer in particular to the need to derive the greatest possible gains from the harmonisation of efforts to reduce emissions and adaptation."
"There is a need to increase research and collect more scientific information, protect ecosystems, and analyse and evaluate current and future funding strategies."
"It is also important to strengthen the relationship between research and various policies and integrate the parameters of adaptation into the EU's internal and external policies where necessary."
"We must ensure the full participation of all national administrative bodies and civil society in tackling the issue."
"In drafting the White Paper on adaptation the Commission will, of course, make full use of the contributions of concerned parties within the framework of dialogue, as well as the European Parliament's views."
"Let me thank you for all your support so far for the European Commission's endeavours."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Sacconi, the rapporteur, for an excellent document which I fully support."
"I would like to say that it proved possible to avoid discussing issues other than adapting in this document."
"We focused on adapting and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for limiting the document to cover only issues relating to adapting and reducing the effects of climate change."
"Nonetheless, I would like to emphasis four matters I consider to be very important."
"We should remember that beyond Europe, that is to say, in Asia, Africa and Oceania, the effects of climate change are very considerable indeed and bear no comparison to what we are experiencing on our continent."
"Secondly, we need to develop technology and ways of adapting that will reduce the impact of the climate changes taking place at present and enable us to adjust and adapt to what is happening to the climate."
"A further reason for acting in this way is so that we can then share our experiences with poorer and developing countries."
"You may well ask why we need to do all this, ladies and gentlemen."
"The reason is that negotiating the post-Kyoto Protocol is a key political challenge facing the European Union, because it is much cheaper to guard against climate change and prevent it happening than to adapt to it."
"Anyone who travels to Asian or African countries or to the islands of Oceania will soon appreciate this."
"Our aim therefore has to be to ensure that the whole world commits to preventing climate change."
"This must come about in Poznań and Copenhagen, and it is our responsibility as the European Union to ensure that it does."
"My final point is that the Union's budget does not provide headings for our priorities."
"Our current priority is to overcome climate change and also to prevent it."
"This is linked to the Union's energy policy."
"We do not have any such headings at present."
"The budget headings should be revised during the mid-term review, because our budget should respond to what the European Union deems to be most important."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, let me first of all congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Sacconi, who has brought his experience on the issue of the environment and climate change to bear and produced a first-rate report."
"Commissioner, as we engage in the real debate on climate change, the problems are all beginning to take shape, with great clarity and speed."
"This is especially true of environmental, economic and energy problems, on which the development and growth of both the European and the international economy are modelled."
"This development appears to have continued aimlessly, wasting natural and human resources, with the clear aim of accumulating capital."
"However, the environment has reached a parlous state, as can be seen from natural disasters, and a credit crisis has been reached."
"The energy products market is turbulent because there is no more equilibrium."
"Spatial planning for energy sources and the food market are in turmoil because agriculture is being used to supply energy."
"All this will prompt significant changes in the EU's production model."
"However, other rival powers such as China and the United States will also take action, in a bid to redistribute productive capital and production factors."
"We hope that the policy of adapting to climate change will prepare the EU's new European development model."
"Perhaps this will protect the environment and employment and give new impetus to social policies, cross-border cooperation measures and taxation policy."
"For this to happen, resources and the Community budget must be redistributed and bolstered since as far as we can judge, they are insufficient to cater for adaptation."
"Commissioner, this is essential because tackling the problem of adaptation is politically costly; there must be no gap between the policies we announce and the budget we allocate."
"If there is, we will not be trusted either by the citizens of today or by future generations."
"Let me say that we fully support Mr Sacconi's report and make three fundamental requests."
"Firstly, the policy of adaptation should be added to all Community policies."
"Secondly, local, regional and central administrations should cooperate with each other; all policies, such as employment, cohesion and agricultural policy, should be coordinated; this is an important issue touched on by the rapporteur."
"Thirdly, and most importantly, international agreements must be cooperated on."
"We will have to bolster these policies as well as the fund, to which reference has been made."
"Commissioner, we also await the results of the White Paper to which you have referred."
"Bearing in mind your sensitivity to these issues and to interinstitutional cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, we believe that the European Parliament will play an important role in your endeavours."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is the first outcome of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, which we wished to set up in order to have a forum for the development of an effective policy ensuring a close link between adaptation and mitigation."
"We are talking here specifically about adaptation, but we should not in fact forget the need to ensure that the resources for adaptation derive partly from the emissions trading system."
"Since it is the poorest countries that bear the greatest burden of climate change, we must see to it that the proceeds from the emissions trading system are placed first and foremost at the disposal of developing countries."
"I believe we can do so by applying a principle of general equity, namely by handing out free rights of emission, to be established essentially on the basis of an equity principle: 'one person, one right of emission'."
"If we think of the one and a half billion poor people in the world and the figures now quoted in the current Kyoto Protocol - approximately €20 per tonne - the granting of a right of emission amounting, for example, to one tonne could make €30 billion per year available to the world's poor for mitigation measures."
"Just think, this might be what is needed by Bangladesh to implement minimal mitigation measures."
"Certain African states are already thinking along these lines, and this principle of equity also indicates that we, the countries primarily responsible for the phenomenon, are shouldering our responsibility for carrying mitigation forward."
"Furthermore, climate change in our own countries means more intense rainfall, longer dry spells and less snowfall."
"We must therefore practise integrated land management to protect the soil, and here I would emphasise the importance of what Mr Sacconi said, because in circumstances of widespread water shortages, rain must be kept where it falls so that it can water the lower slopes."
"In addition, longer dry spells increase the likelihood of fires, which we can address by thinning out woodland to minimise the fire load."
"However, we must act on all fronts at once in a consistent and determined fashion."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, climate change really is one of the most serious problems facing mankind in this day and age."
"Contrary to what people would have us believe, however, mankind cannot make a significant impact on climate change."
"The latter is part of a natural environmental cycle linked to the activity of the sun, and to changes taking place on the earth's crust."
"There is no significant scientific evidence to suggest that drastic cuts in carbon dioxide emissions will make a substantial contribution to reducing climate change."
"I repeat, Commissioner: there is no scientific evidence to that effect."
"There is simply the quasi-religion that so much effort is going into establishing."
"In any case, reductions in carbon dioxide emissions are really only possible in Europe."
"If the situation is as I describe it, and we spend unimaginable sums of money on limiting carbon dioxide emissions, whilst India, China and the United States fail to stand shoulder to shoulder with us, we might as well be throwing those huge sums of money down the drain."
"That money could be put to many other uses."
"It could, for instance, serve to provide people right across Europe with clean water."
"It could also be used to reduce pollution and eliminate toxic gases, oxides, nitrides, sulphides, fluorides and others."
"Everyone could enjoy clean air and clean water and there would still be money left for other purposes."
"I do not believe that climate change will never happen and that there is no need to economise."
"I do maintain, however, that there are no grounds at all for the approach adopted here, whereby the main problem is the emission of carbon dioxide as the key greenhouse gas and that action by human beings can change, reduce or limit potential climate change."
"That is simply a myth."
"Commissioner, some very serious studies are currently available."
"There are documents signed by several hundred climate scientists questioning this type of solution."
"I appeal to the Commissioner, to you, Sir, and to the scientists with whom you are working to consider the matter carefully before taking strategic decisions, as the latter will be very detrimental to the further development of mankind."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, as the previous speaker has just shown, in the European Parliament we are still far from reaching a unanimous view on global warming."
"Nor do I believe that for the time being, we will be able to reconcile the two camps: those who think that global warming is a major problem and those who repeatedly and fundamentally doubt that the problem does indeed exist in this form."
"What I am sure about, however, is that there is one argument which must carry weight even with those of you who take that view."
"The major challenge posed by climate change and the major challenge of securing a reliable, affordable and sustainable energy supply in Europe and other parts of the world can be mastered using the same tools."
"I therefore believe that everything that has been discussed in Europe to date as a response to climate change must make sense even to the sceptics: limited resources or difficult access to energy resources, which are often located in crisis regions of the world, must be addressed with concepts based on renewable energies, energy efficiency and energy saving."
"These are good instruments with which to make progress in both arenas."
"Perhaps there is, after all, a possibility of reaching a consensus."
"As to the major debate about adaptation to climate change which we conducted in committee, there does appear to be broad agreement, and that makes me somewhat mistrustful."
"To my mind, the question is this: why do we find it so easy to agree on instruments for adaptation and yet so difficult to agree on ways of actually combating global warming?"
"I am not really convinced that adaptation measures are going to help us very much in Europe."
"In my view, they distract attention in some ways from the fact that the wrong political strategies and wrong development and industry strategies are still being pursued and are exacerbating the problems we face as a result of global warming."
"In other words, we have completely inappropriate settlement policies, the wrong agricultural policy, the wrong approach to the management of water resources, and poor protection of biosystems."
"This all exacerbates the problems we face while we sit here and argue over adaptation."
"I think that when viewed in relation to the instruments which we are using to combat climate change, these adaptation measures always need to be viewed with a critical eye."
"I would like to emphasise one other point, namely the amendments we have tabled to Mr Sacconi's report today."
"In our amendments, we have concentrated to a very great extent on soil protection."
"I hope that this will be supported, for I believe that this is a fundamental problem which has not yet been adequately addressed at European level."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that even if we were able to keep global warming to within two degrees, that would still mean a scenario of extreme climatic variations in Europe, with consequences for the local economy, the environment and the population."
"Such upheavals would lead to a further increase in regional and social inequalities and disparities within Europe."
"Hence we cannot adopt an approach based solely on cost-benefit analysis, because in Europe, as in the rest of the world, poor people will be those hardest hit: it is they who live in the areas most at risk, and generally they lack information and do not have the wherewithal to react to a rapidly changing environment."
"We must act immediately to counter the effects of climate change, beginning for example with new buildings and new infrastructure, ensuring that town planning takes environmental impact assessments into account; there should be no investment in infrastructure which is already obsolete in terms of the new requirements associated with climate change."
"We must at the same time invest in policies to guarantee access to common goods such as water, food and healthcare resources in the areas most at risk."
"Water is becoming an ever-scarcer resource, so it needs to be managed in a way that makes it available and accessible to all."
"Finally, I should like to conclude by saying that policies for adapting to climate change cannot be dissociated from measures geared to social equity."
"We need a new model of economic development which factors in environmental costs and makes sustainability a key means of encouraging employment and new social policies."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the European Commission and Mr Dimas for this Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action'."
"I would also like to thank Mr Sacconi for all the work he has done on the motion for a resolution."
"I think both documents contain very valuable elements."
"Adapting to climate change can be woven into a lot of existing legislation in the areas of water, energy, agriculture and fisheries, and industry, for example."
"It is also important to assist developing countries in adapting to climate change, for example in the field of environmental technology transfer."
"The European Union has, in my opinion, an historical responsibility in this area."
"At EU level we need to talk primarily about coordinating and gathering knowledge for our strategic policy."
"Moreover, it is vital that the Member States, regions, local authorities and businesses, but also individual citizens, take responsibility for adaptation strategies."
"Fortunately, positive strategies have already been created in this area."
"I am delighted that this element has also been highlighted in Mr Sacconi's motion for a resolution."
"I expect that the European Commission and the Council are taking the recommendations of the European Parliament into serious consideration."
"The EU will then be able to speak with a single voice to the other parties in the international climate debate at the upcoming climate conferences in Poznań and Copenhagen."
"Mr President, I have four quick questions on climate change."
"Firstly, is global warming happening?"
"Answer: no, the world has got slightly cooler over the last 10 years and the rate of cooling is accelerating."
"Secondly, is it caused by mankind?"
"Answer: no, there is increasing scientific evidence to show that what climate change we see is part of natural cycles and has very little or nothing to do with human activity."
"Thirdly, can we make a difference?"
"Even those who believe in global warming accept that the whole of the Kyoto process, if it were fully implemented - and it will not be - would make a tiny difference in 100 years time to global temperatures."
"All the efforts we are making will have practically no effect."
"Fourthly, what will it do to our economies?"
"It will be hugely damaging."
"As Mr Pęk rightly said, we are pouring truckloads of money into a doomed project and causing huge damage to ourselves, to European economies and to our children and grandchildren."
"(RO) The creation of the Committee on Climate Change was determined by the direct impact climate changes have on the planet, endangering the existence of humankind in general."
"We debate the European Treaty, we want to strengthen Community institutions, we create plans for the future."
"We should be very careful, we may have no reason to do this anymore."
"Our health, economy, ecosystems, our way of life, Europe as we know it is in great danger."
"Scientists have expressed their position and we have agreed with them in a large majority."
"Studies are very clear and we can also see here, in Brussels, how weather phenomena of all four seasons happen in one day, which is clearly not normal."
"The mandate of the Committee on Climate Change is extremely clear: it has to analyze the present situation, to make a list of possibilities for combating climate change and formulate concrete proposals regarding the European Union policy in this field, at all decision levels."
"Today's resolution includes a large number of action proposals for the Committee."
"Nevertheless, in order for them to have an effect, I believe these proposals should be considered thoroughly and maybe included into the Committee's final report, adding suggestions for the implementation deadlines."
"Moreover, it is absolutely necessary for the European institutions to propose, as soon as possible, a clear strategy to be negotiated at an international level."
"It is useless to take action only in Europe."
"We should be the promoters of combating climate change at a global level."
"Just concrete actions, which would take into consideration only those arguments regarding the stability of the citizens' lives, could diminish the effects of climate change and these actions should be implemented as soon as possible."
"(FI) Mr President, restraint is obviously the main ingredient in the fight against climate change, but we are at a point where we also need to find ways to adapt."
"It is absolutely right to say that we need a pan-European framework for our adaptation policy, in which to coordinate common targets, targets which are as ambitious as possible, and pave the way for cooperation."
"We nevertheless also have to remember, as has been said here, that the remedies for adaptation are also very local and very regional, so that the power of decision for employing the remedies must be at regional level."
"We now know very well what we need to do to be better able to acclimatise to the future in a way that allows our lifestyles to adapt to changed circumstances."
"For example, we already have available to us right now the construction technology necessary to construct buildings which do not consume energy, but, on the contrary, produce it."
"It is quite unbelievable that no progress has yet been made in this field, because it is a relatively simple matter."
"We also know that climate change will have an impact on people's living conditions."
"We have already had experience of heatwaves and the heavy toll of human life that results from them in different Member States."
"There may be a greater incidence of epidemic disease too, with these diseases occurring in places where they are at present unknown."
"It is all this that our healthcare systems must be able to respond to, with everyone having guaranteed access to healthcare services."
"(SV) I would first like to thank the Commission and the Commissioner, Stavros Dimas, for the Green Paper on adapting to climate change."
"It is a document which all decision-makers and business managers, indeed all Europeans, should read in order to understand the kind of challenges that face us and what we need to do."
"After all, as many speakers have already pointed out, a great many people will be affected by the changes in climate which we can see coming."
"Hitherto we have talked a great deal in economic terms in the European debate, but climate change will alter the whole environment of our lives."
"A subject to which we have not so far devoted sufficient discussion is health."
"The World Health Organisation has indicated that 60 000 deaths last year can be linked to climate change."
"It calls for an entirely different approach to social planning, entirely different technology and huge investment."
"It may frighten many people, but we must make this investment in order to cope with climate change and technical development and in order to hold our own in competition with other parts of the world."
"As always in an engineering revolution, there will be winners and losers, but throughout the EU system we are working to ensure that European industry and European workers will be winners in this situation."
"This will require considerable investment, forward-looking decisions and cooperation across borders."
"There can be no decisions on transport which do not take climate change into account."
"There can be no discussion of public health or education without addressing climate change."
"One of the most important matters we have begun to deal with is of course water, in Europe and at global level."
"We have received visits in the committee from representatives of the Maldives, a country where the highest point is just over two metres above current sea level."
"The Maldives will partially disappear if we cannot solve the climate problem."
"It is the poorest countries which will suffer most."
"I would therefore like to issue a challenge to the Commission: the Solidarity Fund must be boosted and given more resources, and aid from the EU must also focus on climate questions."
"Otherwise we cannot help the rest of the world, and moreover, we shall not get a good agreement out of the negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, the debate triggered by Mr Sacconi's question is of great relevance to the citizens of Europe."
"We should link countering climate change with limiting changes in the global market that are detrimental to us."
"I am referring, in particular, to the meteoric rise in the price of gas and oil, of which we are the largest importer."
"We must also consider the scenario regarding the consequences of increasing CO2."
"It is a fact that trees and plants flourished when the CO2 content of the atmosphere was much greater."
"During the last millennium there was a time when it was possible to travel from Poland to Sweden across the frozen Baltic."
"There was also a time when grain and apples were harvested in April in my country."
"At present, the apple trees are just starting to blossom."
"That is why the accepted theory about the harmful greenhouse effect resulting from increased CO2 emissions should be tested against the rather different views held by a large number of scientists."
"There may well be other reasons for these unusual climatic events and droughts."
"Incomplete understanding of the subject may of course result in unnecessary expenditure from our coffers."
"It is true that CO2 emissions are accompanied by compounds of nitrogen and sulphur, and by particulates that are harmful to the environment and to human health, especially in the ever-extending urban areas."
"For environmental protection and economic reasons, sectoral policies should focus on priorities such as: actions to reduce the demand for hydrocarbons, the exploitation of renewable energy, biofuels, the promotion of nuclear energy, the use of coal in chemical processing not just in power stations, and the use of electrically-powered vehicles in transport and communication."
"These priorities will significantly reduce the emissions of CO2 and other harmful substances, providing added value to the citizens of the Union."
"Resources should be ring-fenced for each of these areas by way of preferential priorities and grants."
"(FR) Commissioner, I want to put a question to you."
"Do you not feel slightly alone within the Commission?"
"What you are proposing to us is something revolutionary."
"I am not talking about adaptation because I think that talking about adaptation alone is perhaps not the best solution since we have not yet quantified the consequences."
"What are the real consequences of climate change?"
"At present, we really do not know."
"However, we will certainly be able to quantify the consequences if we do nothing."
"We also know why we have reached this point."
"It is simply the result of the policies we have put in place: the agricultural policy, the economic policy, etc."
"Surely we should be asking ourselves what type of growth we want today in order to slow down climate change."
"What does it mean today to ask for growth in all our Member States?"
"These are fundamental questions, Mr Dimas, that you are asking us to raise today, because this is not just a matter for the Commission or for the Temporary Committee on Climate Change."
"It is a matter that affects the whole world today and every one of us."
"I do not like this manner, shall we say, of perhaps absolving ourselves of responsibility, and maybe even misleading our fellow citizens by trying to get them to believe that we can adapt to climate change and that at the end of the day the situation may not be as serious because we are going to have the means to adapt to it."
"No, Commissioner, that would really be pulling the wool over their eyes."
"Since we are at the beginning of the proposals on this issue, we are in the process of preparing an energy package and we know how much resistance there will be to achieving the level of results we desire, which is nonetheless a minimum minimorum."
"As you can see, we have a long road ahead of us."
"I am not saying that what you are proposing is bad."
"It is encouraging, but the revolution you are proposing will have to be quantified in order to convince the other Commissioners that we need to go in another direction."
"You will have to convince the Agriculture Commissioner that we need to go in another direction."
"You will have to convince Mr Louis Michel that we need to mention climate change in the partnership agreements with Africa."
"We need to reshape our African policies, and this policy will have to incorporated into the synergy we have created with the African countries."
"Today or tomorrow Mr Sarkozy is going to propose a Union for the Mediterranean."
"What has he proposed to combat climate change?"
"These countries are directly involved."
"I wish you luck, Commissioner, for your job is undoubtedly going to be extremely difficult."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall focus on two points."
"Even today, billions of people have no access to water and hundreds of millions are dying as a result."
"Climate change is bound to worsen the situation."
"The price will be paid mainly by continents such as Africa, which are already enduring terrible conditions and, even though they pollute less, are harder hit by climate change."
"The right to water must become a top priority for adaptation policies."
"I say 'right' because this right has still not yet been sanctioned."
"International documents refer to the 'need for water', whilst real military and economic wars are being waged with a view to appropriating water and turning it into a commodity."
"It is therefore necessary to sanction the right to water and pursue policies enabling that right to be implemented."
"In this sense it may be useful - and here I am addressing the Commissioner - to draw up a water protocol for inclusion in the text of the post-Kyoto agreements."
"Along with water goes soil."
"We have a European directive in need of approval."
"We must combat desertification and promote the role of the soil as an agent of climate balance: that is the thrust of our directive."
"Good agricultural practice, unlike for example the production of biodiesel, can guarantee both food output and carbon capture."
"Adaptation, therefore, does not mean surrendering to climate change but intervening to combat it."
"Mr President, the EU is proud of its commitment to the IPCC's recommendations on how to combat global warming by persuading its Member States to inject massive funding into carbon-emission control projects."
"But have you backed the wrong horse?"
"Last month many eminent scientists and climatologists from around the world met in New York and after two days of serious discussions issued the Manhattan Declaration, which states categorically that there is no convincing evidence that CO2 emissions from modern industrial activity have in the past, are now, or will in the future cause catastrophic climate change; and that adaptation, as needed, is massively more cost-effective than any attempted mitigation."
"They recommend that world leaders reject the views expressed by the United Nations IPCC, as well as popular but misguided works such as An Inconvenient Truth, and that all taxes, regulations and other interventions intended to reduce emissions of CO2 be abandoned forthwith."
"Finally, Lord Lawson, who is a member of the House of Lords Select Committee on Climate Change, says this: 'The average temperature in Helsinki is less than 5°C. In Singapore it is in excess of 27°C - a difference of 22°."
"If humans can successfully cope with that, it is not immediately apparent why they should not be able to adapt to a change of some 3° when they are given 100 years in which to do so.'"
"I recommend that you take advice given in the Manhattan Declaration."
"(CS) Despite my doubts that the temperature changes we are observing have been caused by human activities, I would like to support some of the key points of Mr Sacconi's report."
"Like the rapporteur, I believe that the Green Paper lacks an examination of the socio-economic dimension and an analysis of the expected consequences for the populations concerned, as well as issues of interdependence between individual sectors on impact adaptation."
"I also support the requirement that the Council should lower the thresholds for mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund and that the Commission should carry out a study on the economics of adaptation, and develop scenarios establishing a balance sheet of adaptation costs and benefits."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that if we want to act in the interests of the citizens of the EU, we should invest in research, development and education in the field of nuclear energy."
"Scientific findings show that nuclear energy does not produce CO2 and that it minimises the aggravation of climate change."
"At the same time it is the least expensive silicon technology and it is also reliable and secure."
"I think it is a mistake that the Commission Green Paper, which we are discussing here today, makes only a marginal reference to nuclear energy."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, agriculture and forestry are among the economic sectors hardest hit by climate change and therefore have a strong interest in efficient climate protection measures, also at global level."
"All states - particularly developing countries - need to be involved in the regime for the post-Kyoto period."
"Binding targets for developing countries are essential, but emissions must be reduced within a reasonable timeframe."
"Through animal husbandry and the use of fertilisers, agriculture does contribute to greenhouse gas emissions."
"Unlike industry, transport and space heating, however, these are natural emissions."
"Let me give you some examples: in Austria, agriculture produces just 8.66% of emissions."
"Since 1990, these emissions have fallen by around 14%."
"Besides waste management, Austrian agriculture is the only sector to have already fulfilled Austria's 'minus 13%' Kyoto target."
"The opportunities afforded by agriculture range from CO2 storage in soils, the optimum use of humus and the production of biomass as an energy resource."
"I would point out, Mr President, that industry in Austria has also made great efforts to keep its emissions as low as possible."
"Currently, about 9% of total EU greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, which means it is far less of a polluter than energy use, with 59%, or transport with 21%, for example."
"Commissioner, if we really are to get a grip on climate change, energy avoidance and increased energy efficiency must be our goals."
"(RO) Climate changes are more and more obvious and humankind should change its behavior, giving more attention to environmental protection."
"Europe is already dealing with very high temperatures during summer, droughts followed by heavy rains and floods, violent storms and desertification of vast regions, especially in the Southern and Eastern regions."
"Romania has not been exempt from the effects of climate change either."
"In recent years, we have seen devastating floods, hot days, violent storms, the desertification of regions in the Southern and Eastern part of the country, a decrease in precipitation."
"All these have led to loss of human lives, important material damage and a decrease in agricultural production."
"Europe needs to take firm action today in order to reduce the effects of climate change."
"Europe needs to take action for a better water management, protection against floods, wastewater purification, protection of coastal areas, increase in energy efficiency, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, adopting less polluting agriculture, adopting ecological transport, stopping deforestation."
"Special attention must be given to areas under desertification."
"Europe should examine the possibility of investing in an irrigation system that would assist the Member States in danger of diminishing their agricultural production following desertification in building or improving their irrigation systems."
"I congratulate the Commission for the Green Paper on a new urban mobility policy."
"20% of European motorists could use public transport."
"Also, reducing the speed limit will allow us to fight the greenhouse effect."
"The introduction of aviation into the emission certificates trading scheme is a first step forward."
"The introduction of maritime transport into this scheme is also being considered."
"Unfortunately, the Union's current budget does not integrate the necessary actions for reducing climate change sufficiently and coherently."
"The budget for climate change is modest."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the effects of climate change are evident and are only going to become more pronounced."
"We now know that despite the implementation of an ambitious policy to combat climate change we can only stabilise the phenomenon, and we therefore have to adapt to its consequences."
"Adapting to climate change will require ambitious financing in many areas, and in my view the most important of these are: health, agriculture, water protection, housing and population migrations."
"To this end, our policy on support for European research should give priority to these areas."
"Combating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change should become compulsory conditions for the allocation of European funding."
"This is a global problem; we thus need global responses."
"The European Union must make every effort to establish at global level a policy on adapting to climate change."
"This policy should take account of the growing number of natural disasters when drawing up health and agricultural plans."
"This policy should focus above all on the most vulnerable countries, i.e. the poorest countries."
"Just as we can hope to benefit from the fruit of European research, we must ensure that the developing countries benefit from it too."
"We should transfer our technologies to third countries without necessarily expecting any recompense."
"However, adapting to climate change does not just mean making greater use of technologies."
"We also need to look at some of the practices we have inherited from previous generations."
"For example, in my region, the south-west of France, the old farms face directly to the south: the inhabitants had realised that the direction in which the house faced protected them from the easterly and westerly winds, and made them lighter and warmer in winter and cooler in summer thanks to shade from the trees."
"They were bioclimatic houses."
"Today such practices are neglected, and yet they are so simple."
"We must go back to these simple, sensible actions and continue to encourage research into better housing."
"It is in this sector that we need to find solutions to avoid, for example, the use of energy for air conditioning in houses."
"We need to emphasise how important it is for buildings to be energy efficient."
"Finally, we must move from raising awareness among the public to education and training."
"We must pass on to the younger generations the appropriate and considered actions and, of course, our generation must learn them too."
"I would like to finish by congratulating Mr Sacconi on his excellent and polished report."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened with interest to your opening speech."
"You must know that you have many allies here in the European Parliament, but I am afraid that there are far fewer people who support these objectives of yours within the Commission itself."
"In order to be in the vanguard of the struggle against climate change, the EU must above all be consistent in its announcements."
"Consequently, when you rightly talk about mainstreaming and say that we must reduce greenhouse gases, the Commission cannot fund the EU's continuing dependence on carbon and petrol."
"The foreign policy of the Commission and the Council must pressurise Mr Bush, not cajole him, to commit to these agreements."
"The policy must help poorer countries with a technology transfer and resources package so that they can take part in the global alliance."
"You must also listen to the criticisms voiced by the European Parliament about the this obsession with biofuels, which are destroying the Amazon forests, wrecking the global climate, doubling food prices and thus putting pressure on the poorer sections of society."
"To conclude, Commissioner, we are with you, but you must put up more of a fight in order to win over the Commission itself."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, climate change is a challenge to us all."
"We must remember that we share this world not just with people today, but with those who come in the future."
"However, if our policies are going to be effective, we must distinguish between man-made and natural climate change."
"The first is the effect of our activities; the other is a natural process."
"Our landscapes, soils and river systems are all the result of natural and ongoing climate change."
"Man-made climate change is inexcusable."
"The response to it is change - change of fuels, change of consumption and change of heart."
"Making the distinction is not to say that natural climate change is not a worry, but the answer to it is adaptation."
"Archaeologists tell us that, in the past, when the climates changed, people who could adapted and people who could not perished."
"Today we humans have burrowed deep."
"Our homes and cities are cemented into the earth's crust."
"Our habits and habitats have become inflexible."
"Having an ice age or an era of heat is just not on our agenda at the moment: 'please come back in an eon or so.'"
"The response to natural climate change is long-sighted planning, intelligent preparation and common sense."
"Do not build on flood plains."
"Plant deciduous forests."
"Shore up endangered coastlines."
"We must balance our approach to climate change between change and adaptation, between man-made and natural, and use our funds appropriately so that they will be effective."
"(NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against global warming is not just Europe's fight: it must become the whole planet's battle."
"Otherwise all our great plans will be meaningless and the Europeans alone will make enormous efforts for results that will remain a drop in the ocean."
"In addition, we need to ensure European dynamism today."
"Again, massive and unattainable goals lie ahead of us."
"The European summit in March of this year stipulated that greenhouse gas emissions must be down 20% by 2020, with renewable energy meeting 20% of the Union's demand."
"However, one of the major questions that remains is, naturally, who will pay for that?"
"Companies and consumers would have to cough up about EUR 60 billion a year for the climate plan, which for my country, Belgium, would work out at EUR 2 billion a year, and globally at at least EUR 200per citizen."
"This not only threatens an enormous tax increase, but is also a factor that threatens to force businesses to move abroad to countries where the environmental restrictions are less stringent."
"We must therefore stick to 'treating the symptoms' as long as some of the players on the world stage are not prepared to make the necessary efforts."
"(ES) Thank you, Mr President."
"First and foremost, I would like to congratulate Mr Sacconi on his question, which gives us the opportunity to discuss climate change here today."
"My colleagues will speak on more technical aspects, but I want to take this opportunity to thank the Commissioner and, above all, to express my support for everything he is doing in this regard: he was one of the forerunners and one of the first people to talk about climate change here in Brussels."
"What I want, above all, is for consideration to be given to specific geographical characteristics, and one area in particular, which will of no surprise to you: the island regions."
"The beautiful Greek islands - like the Balearics, which I represent - may be at risk in the future from any climate changes that occur."
"In my view, the Commission cannot recognise solely the specific nature of the outermost regions; it must also incorporate the insularity factor and, of course, mountainous and coastal regions."
"The studies by the Spanish Oceanography Institute, and many others, highlight the fact that the Mediterranean Sea is undergoing an accelerated warming process and a rise in the water level."
"This could have significant repercussions on the coastline, especially the beaches, which would be flooded, with the corresponding impact on tourism, our main source of income."
"In the example I was talking about, the Balearics, temperatures have risen notably in recent years, which is cause for concern."
"The Green Paper must also include a commitment to support the regions requiring substantial investment to counteract the effects of climate change."
"I want to end by outlining my personal ambition, and that of the European People's Party, which is for the European Union to take the lead in the area of carbon-free or low-carbon technologies."
"We firmly believe that a rapid and brave switch to more modern and efficient technologies will not only benefit our climate and provide the basis for a global solution, but will also be advantageous for the economy since it will make us much less dependent on imports of fossil fuels."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, adaptation to climate change needs more of our attention and soon, because whatever we do about climate change we also need to invest in adapting societies to cope with rising sea and river levels, or conversely less water and drought."
"All these have consequences for security, water consumption, the soil, agriculture, but also, clearly, for public health."
"Some areas must prepare themselves for severe drought and higher temperatures."
"Irrigation systems and clean desalination units are the solution in this case."
"Other areas must deal with water as an inconvenience and must invest in dyke reinforcement."
"It is for the Member States themselves to make plans, to analyse the impact of climate change and to get ready."
"There are, however, three important points."
"First of all, solidarity is very necessary: some countries are carried along by others while some have more strength than others."
"It goes without saying that the European Union also has a common responsibility."
"Secondly, there must thus also be a common source of financing."
"We must look for sources of financing and the obvious thing is to look at the Structural Funds but also at the revenue from ETS auctions."
"Thirdly, solidarity must of course also apply to the developing countries."
"Many African and Asian countries have themselves hardly contributed to climate change but are still negatively affected by it."
"Sound and solid sources of financing must be found, and here to the obvious thing is to look at the ETS revenue."
"(SV) In this report we ask for measures to make agriculture face up to its climate responsibility."
"Agriculture includes the livestock industry, which accounts for 18% of world emissions of greenhouse gases."
"Eighteen per cent!"
"This is stated by the FAO in its report 'Livestock's long shadow' of 2006."
"What can we do to bring down this 18% share of emissions?"
"When IPCC Chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, spoke to us in the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, he called for a reduction in meat consumption."
"He is quite right."
"Never before in the history of the world have we eaten as much meat as we do today."
"Since the 1950s, world production of meat has increased more than fivefold."
"This is not sustainable."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Dimas: do you agree with Rajendra Pachauri that we should eat less meat?"
"I call on the Commission to develop a plan for the reduction of meat consumption."
"Finally, some suggestions: an information campaign on vegetarian eating, a call on the Member States to introduce meat taxes so that meat becomes dearer and vegetarian food cheaper, promotion of green eating in our own EU institutions; for example, a vegetarian week in the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council would be a good, modern and green start for a more sustainable Union."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I say 'yes' to the climate package because Europe must send a strong signal to the world on the eve of the launch of Copenhagen's international negotiations."
"I must tell you that employees and employers in my constituency are extremely concerned about the proposal to do away with free CO2 emission quotas and allow them to be auctioned off."
"With this proposal, Europe would inflict a double hardship on businesses, which would have to pay for CO2 emission abuses over and above the quota, but also for any CO2 emissions from the first tonne produced."
"European businesses would thus face an unprecedented rise in costs."
"If this standard were to be applied worldwide, that would be fine: everyone would thus be in the same boat."
"However, if this constraint is only applied to European companies, they would be penalised financially and there would be a serious risk of jobs relocating outside the Union."
"Should we then abandon this idea of paying CO2 emissions from the first tonne produced?"
"I do not think so because the ultimate goal is commendable."
"Nevertheless, in this case Europe must have available a fair mechanism that consists of taxing imports from third countries that do not make the same environmental efforts as European companies."
"Yes, let us create a 'carbon' tax: far from being a cautious protectionist instrument, it is an instrument designed to ensure fair and undistorted trade at global level, which is a fundamental objective of the European Union and the WTO."
"As for the rest, I welcome the Commission's various proposals."
"It is a positive move to ensure that as many economic sectors as possible are included in the mechanisms - ETS or others - to combat climate change."
"I note, in particular, that the transport sector, at which we often point the finger, is preparing to make its contribution and that is something I welcome."
"In conclusion, I hope that we will be able to reach an agreement quickly, i.e. before the end of the year, and that this climate package can thus be implemented as soon as possible."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, climate change is on the way; that is a scientifically proven fact."
"The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report states quite clearly that no region of Europe will be spared its effects."
"It is important to keep increases in temperature under 2°C. However, even global warming of less than 2°C would have negative economic and environmental consequences for certain regions of Europe."
"That is why Europe must act now."
"We must initiate adaptation measures now, and in many policy fields."
"However, climate change also presents opportunities; one of these opportunities is for us to prepare ourselves for climate change by means of adaptation measures."
"As we think about adaptation measures, we should also adapt the Lisbon process to the demands of climate change."
"This offers an opportunity to create an environmentally driven industrial policy: an economic and industrial policy which decouples economic growth from CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions."
"This will be the key to success."
"Let me pose a question to the Commissioner here: to what extent is the Commission discussing the Lisbon process in the context of climate change?"
"The second point is this: it is also important to ensure that local and regional decision-makers are informed about the effects of climate change on their areas."
"How will climate change affect the individual regions?"
"This will be very important in terms of development planning, for example, which is why I support the proposal in the motion for a resolution which calls for the establishment of a European database that is accessible to regional decision-makers as a guide for their development planning."
"Mr President, could I suggest that we stop beating ourselves up over climate change and blaming each sector as if one is more guilty than the other?"
"In particular this impression comes through about the contribution made by agriculture."
"Europe is powerless on its own to do anything about climate change, but it can provide much-needed leadership."
"We need global coordinated action, and that is recognised."
"Let me deal specifically with the debate around agriculture."
"It contributes to climate change but it is also affected by it: that has been stated already."
"However, it is important to remember that agriculture produces food and without food we are not going very far."
"If you look at global demand for food it is set to increase by 50% in 20 years, but agriculture can, through carbon sequestration, anaerobic digestion, forestry planting - and I think that is the key - and wind energy, contribute to this debate."
"In terms of the Irish situation we have actually reduced our emissions from agriculture by 3% since 1990, but look at what has happened to transport, where emissions are up by 163%."
"For industry the figure is 23%, and for energy 32%."
"The danger of targeting agriculture is that we will reduce cattle numbers and reduce emissions in Europe, but we will transfer production elsewhere and make absolutely no difference."
"So we do need to be careful on this."
"Traditional practices, like digging your garden in the autumn and leaving it over winter, are now a no-no."
"Well, I am guilty because I still do it."
"Let us be sensible in this debate."
"Let us do the research and development so that we do not go backwards, but go forward with positive solutions."
"Look at India."
"It has 17% of the world population but only contributes to 4% of global greenhouse emissions."
"It has got to develop to look after its poor people."
"It will contribute to the debate on climate change but it can only do it in a way that recognises its real present situation."
"Finally, can I say that the Lisbon Treaty, for the first time, gives us some hope for a global action on climate change, with Europe providing leadership."
"On that basis I hope that the Irish population turn out and vote overwhelmingly 'yes' to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(ES) Thank you, Mr President, and thank you, Mr Sacconi, for all your work."
"We have a problem."
"Therefore, public and private investment in research and development to combat climate change is vital to ensure that the adaptation and mitigation actions are as effective as possible in relation to the limits and consequences of climate change."
"We have an enormous task ahead of us, Commissioner."
"We must implement measures in the field of energy efficiency, promotion of renewable energies, efficient cogeneration, efficient use of fuels in motor vehicles, energy-saving public transport and lighting, better administration of farming and pasture land and reduction of deforestation, not forgetting better water use, given its scarcity."
"However, I want to take this opportunity to make two requests."
"The first is to you, Commissioner: I ask you to revise urgently the policy on biofuels, both first and second generation."
"The second is addressed to the Council: in spite of the fact that the rise in temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns caused by climate change will affect the land, no agreement has yet been reached on an adequate European framework for the protection of the land."
"A firm commitment must be made without delay."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sacconi, ladies and gentlemen, as the PPE-DE's coordinator for regional policy, I want to stress that some very important points are made in this resolution."
"A relationship is established between cohesion policy and risk management and there is the idea of the integral and explicit components of future regional policy in Europe."
"In addition, the regions' position within the Union is altered by climate change."
"There will be drought on the one hand, and too much water on the other hand, with rising sea levels."
"The latter development is something that I must highlight as a representative of the Netherlands."
"Half of our land is below sea level."
"Marine dykes must be higher, but there are also many more technological challenges to consider."
"That applies even more to other parts of the world."
"It is also positive that we are looking to coordinate with the UN's Strategy for Disaster Reduction."
"Cohesion - and I would refer to the Lisbon Treaty in this respect - has a new territorial dimension, which we must develop and which must be included in our financial programming."
"This is something that is close to the people, in the regions and in the cities, and Europe has a role to play in this regard."
"Mr President, the PPE-DE does not support the first part of paragraph 13, because at this time we are in favour of redistributing funds rather than reprioritising: it is already happening in fact."
"More than EUR 15 billion are currently being allocated from the Structural Funds to, for example, bio fuels, etc."
"We want to keep going down this route."
"We will thus once again be revising the Structural Funds Regulation in order to achieve more energy efficiency."
"That is the PPE-DE's approach and we will take part in the debates on the long-term financial perspective - referred to in part two of paragraph 13 - and take the lead in possible reallocation or reprioritisation, but not at this time: that can be done more successfully by committing budgets and sectors than by redistributing at the moment."
"(LT) I must commend Mr Sacconi regarding the significant additions to the Commission's timely Green Paper on the issue of climate change."
"Some countries, mainly Nordic, have already developed a long-term strategy for dealing with climate change without any encouragement from Brussels, foreseeing actions to be taken in reaction to climate change: protecting coastal areas, taking measures against coastal flooding, building specially designed houses."
"The adoption of the White Paper will encourage other countries to follow their example."
"The EU countries with sea and ocean borders - and there are 22 of them - should meanwhile study the experience of the Netherlands in resisting the sea."
"Half of the country's territory is below sea level."
"The ongoing efforts of the Dutch people to resist assaults from the sea and the enormous resources they are directing towards protection against them have not prevented them from creating one of the world's strongest and most flourishing states."
"Therefore, it proves that the possibility to adapt does exist."
"At the recent meeting of the EU Council it was declared that the issue of climate change would be of the greatest importance in the preparation of the EU's prevention and protection policy."
"Conflicts and wars to gain areas still suitable to live in as well as those providing water and food should be prevented before it is too late."
"This particularly concerns the poorest countries of the world, which have contributed the least to climate change."
"Those that have progressed at the expense of others should pay back their debt without delay."
"In future the EU should continue to provide leadership to other continents and states in setting an example of how to adopt measures to prevent climate change, adapt to new conditions and transform the habits and practices of their citizens."
"Mr President, well, we are supposed to stay cool when following a debate, but this debate has got out of hand and it has literally gone with the wind, and with it has gone honesty and rationalism."
"We are supposed to be honest, but painting a gloomy picture has always been politically very good."
"It has always paid off."
"But we are supposed to be serious and we have to look at the figures and remain rational and honest."
"People can live in Helsinki, with its average annual temperature of 6°C, or they can live in Dakar in 30°C. Two thousand years ago, Julius Caesar was walking on the Rhine because it was frozen over."
"One thousand years ago, the Vikings were in Greenland - that is why it is called Greenland."
"Therefore, temperature is not an end in itself, but the prosperity of people is an end in itself and that is what we forget."
"Why do we have emissions?"
"That is the result of prosperity, and two thirds of people in the world still live in poverty."
"The human family is arranged as in a staircase: we, the privileged ones, are at the top, and there are four billion people below us who, literally, want to come into the daylight, because two billion people do not even have electricity."
"So what is our answer?"
"Our answer is to improve our technology."
"For that we need money and we need our economy to grow."
"We cannot have money if we are wasting and damaging our economy by applying measures that are counterproductive and very costly."
"The Commissioner did not even mention the key word 'nuclear' in his opening remarks."
"If we are not honest in this debate, then we are not serious leaders."
"To sum up, we are a little bit like the man whose roof is leaking, but instead of fixing it he starts to wallpaper his cellar."
"Well, that is not how to build our future."
"(ES) Thank you, Mr President."
"I think that the role of, and document on, adaptation are important."
"Nevertheless, the problem of climate change is a work in progress: we are constantly learning and understanding what is happening and what the possible solutions are."
"I think that it is vital to ensure that the policy as a whole does not take a top-down approach."
"If we want to take the lead in this field, we have to ensure that others follow us; otherwise, the leader will stand alone."
"There is the risk that if Europe advances too rapidly, if it causes a crisis in industry, if it only implements policies - I should say 'metapolicies' - from the top down, it will not work."
"We must use all means of action on the ground, get society enthusiastically involved, and adapt to our own society's capacity for adaptation, because we must not let our welfare suffer."
"In this respect, I would also stress that this document makes very little mention of adaptation on the ground, and it is something we need to talk about."
"Particularly when talking about the topic of water, which is crucial and which is going to be the aspect most affected by climate change, if it is not already, it is important to remember to focus on formulas and actions on the ground - which are often very simple - with regard to soil permeability, reforestation, water harvesting, using existing reservoirs to harvest water surpluses, and properly distributing the few resources we have left rather than letting the water run out to sea and be lost."
"To achieve this, sometimes we need to look to the past, to the existing traditions, and sometimes we need to lose our prejudices against solutions such as aquifer recharges and other essential measures."
"I am therefore calling for integrated policies, all-encompassing policies that we can adapt to society, which must listen to our recommendations and comply with them."
"If society is not behind us and is not enthusiastic, we will achieve nothing."
"Therefore, we need to strive for a consensus and listen to everyone."
"(SK) The motion for a resolution prepared in response to the oral question by the Temporary Committee on Climate Change appears to be consistent, but in my view it does not pay enough attention to water, which can mitigate micro and macro-climatic issues caused by land drainage and thus contribute to a healthier climate."
"Parliament's suggestions are in line with an outdated paradigm based on effective management of existing water resources."
"The new water paradigm advocates renewal of water resources in the countryside."
"It advocates improving the water cycle with a view to gradually ensuring that there is sufficient water for all."
"The goal of the paradigm is to adapt the current situation concerning the drainage of large areas as a result of deforestation, agriculture or sewerage."
"Land drainage reduces evaporation, changes solar heat into metabolic heat and transforms enormous energy flows within it."
"Even the slightest 1 mm reduction through evaporation in an area the size of Slovakia corresponds on a sunny day to a release of metabolic heat equivalent to the yearly output of all the power stations in Slovakia."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Sacconi and Commissioner Dimas for their efforts."
"I hope I have succeeded in drawing your attention to these new ideas."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to point out that some colleagues and I originally tabled a number of amendments to this dossier specifically addressing key issues such as the effect of climate change on biodiversity and the havoc it is already wreaking in the developing world, both of which are issues which must be dealt with without further hesitation."
"The EU's credibility on climate change policies and our claims of being at the heart of any international agreement on emissions trading post-2012 will depend on our political willingness to put our money where our collective mouth is when it comes to earmarking the revenues from the auctioning of emission allowances, and this could be up to EUR 40 billion per annum."
"Generous funding for technology transfer, adaptation and mitigation measures and others will be a measure of our acceptance of our historic responsibility towards third countries, those most likely to bear the brunt of climate change, including adverse weather, desertification, coastal flooding and serious water shortages."
"On this point, the legislation on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, for which I am rapporteur, must include some political direction on auction revenues, which will test the European Council's commitment, resolve and understanding on the 2°C target and, might I say, its understanding of the serious global impact of climate change, as we strive to create low-carbon economies throughout the EU, as our contribution to a global deal in Copenhagen."
"(FR) Mr President, last week I was in Argentina with the Mercosur delegation."
"I noted that none of our political representatives was concerned about climate change."
"There was more discussion of increasing the amount of land available for soya production and deforestation to gain more cultivable land; even our delegation had not paid much attention to the topic."
"I would therefore ask the following question: are we in the process of devising a twin-speed policy in Europe?"
"Would it not be better to coordinate our position everywhere, in the knowledge that the climate change policy is a policy on the redistribution of resources?"
"It is a fundamental justice policy that must be applied at global level."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, let me touch on an issue connected with climate change."
"In today's debate no-one has mentioned the European Commission's recent Communication on Reinforcing the Union's Disaster Response Capacity."
"Attached to the Communication is a special annex entitled 'Forest Fires'; this refers to the great, catastrophic fires that struck southern Europe, and Greece in particular, last summer."
"These fires are linked to climate change."
"I believe there is an urgent need to take preventive measures throughout Europe and especially in the south, which, according to the IPCC, is more prone to fires and is already facing frequent bouts of extreme weather conditions."
"For this reason, Commissioner, there is a compelling need for the EU to take both medium-term and immediate measures in order to ensure that events like those of last year are not repeated next summer."
"(CS) However utterly new and unique this era might appear, it is also true that the past witnessed great climate changes and cycles."
"I believe that studies in historical climatology will be among the most important tools for responding to this challenge."
"We have at our disposal works such as A Green History of the World by Clive Ponting or the writings of the French historian Emmanuel le Roy Ladurie."
"In my opinion, we must realise that in the past people were able to cope with the changes in the natural environment."
"For example, in my native Czech Republic, one of the most harmonious natural environments is to be found in the Southern Bohemian basin."
"Few people realise that it is an artificial landscape."
"This area, which was created by men, used to be bog land, whereas today it has a lake and is a popular tourist destination."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very important and interesting contributions, and when we finalise our white paper on adaptation we shall take into account what has been expressed today and what the resolution of the European Parliament is recommending."
"I would like to underline that, without the continued support of the European Parliament, most of our policies that are in place today would not have been adopted, and the leading role of the European Union in the world would not provide the hope that an international agreement will be achieved in Copenhagen in 2009."
"It is our main objective to have an international agreement to fight climate change, and to adapt to changing climatic conditions, in which all the countries of the world will participate and especially the United States and other big emitters, because then the fight against climate change will be effective."
"Of course, the European Union's efforts will not be enough, but we cannot hope to have an international agreement if we do not take active leadership regarding this."
"I heard again today some doubts about science."
"I think this issue has more or less been dealt with."
"There is almost a consensus in science that climate change is anthropogenic: it is caused by human activities."
"There are a small number of scientists who think differently."
"Some people still think that the world is flat, but even in the United States that is not taken seriously any more."
"Last week a report from the World Health Organisation underlined the impact on health caused by climatic conditions and changes in climate, and NASA warned us that climate change is happening faster than we thought."
"Therefore, relying on what science is telling us, we have to act."
"Concerning cost: if we act later, we shall pay more; if we act now, we shall pay much less and we shall also avoid the irreversible impact of climate change on our planet."
"We have a duty to ourselves and to the next generations to leave the world in at least the same condition as we inherited it."
"We also have a moral duty, which many Members stressed, towards those who have not contributed to the formation of the greenhouse phenomenon - the least-developed countries in the world, which not only have a very low income per capita but also have contributed only a very small fraction to the formation of this phenomenon."
"Therefore adaptation, along with efforts for mitigation, is absolutely necessary, and we have to do that by helping the least-developed countries and also by taking the right measures in the European Union."
"I heard various examples of what is happening right now, for example in the important issue of water."
"We have legislation - the Water Framework Directive - which deals with this very precious and scarce resource, but we also adopted very recently a communication on water scarcity and droughts, because this is becoming a very important and urgent problem that we have to deal with."
"Again concerning the cost, a few speakers mentioned the question of auctioning and how this will affect our energy-intensive industries or other sectors of the economy."
"I should like to clear up one misunderstanding to defuse this issue."
"The revenue that will be generated by auctioning will not go to the European Union's or any other coffers, but will go to the ministries of finance of the Member States which will auction the allowances."
"This should be clearly understood."
"This money could be between EUR 30 billion and EUR 50 billion every year, and we have recommended - and I hope that the European Parliament will agree - that part of it should go to adaptation policies."
"So we have the funding ready if we have the political will to go ahead with accepting this principle that we earmark a certain amount of this EUR 30-50 billion per year to go to adaptation policies."
"I would like to speak for longer, because this is a very big issue and many questions were asked, but I would like to thank you again for your contributions."
"We will continue to cooperate closely with you and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change in formulating our policies and working hard, especially during these two years, to achieve an international agreement in Copenhagen."
"To wind up the debate, one motion for a resolution has been tabled pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (GA) It should be perfectly clear to all by now that we need to prepare for climate change."
"Our society and economy must change as our climate changes."
"As a supranational organisation, the European Union has a special role in allowing the relevant preparation and coordination of its Members."
"Acts done at EU level should be ambitious and in keeping with the scientific reality of our times."
"Forward planning can help us deal with the most adverse effects of climate change."
"The EU should be generous in its external relations when dealing with developing countries and help them adapt to climate change - a phenomenon for which they are not responsible, but one from which they will suffer disproportionately."
"Future trade measures concluded with the developing world should take this into account if they are to be in any way fair."
"in writing. - (HU) The fact that the European Commission's green paper summarises all the tools we have at our disposal for mitigating the adverse consequences of climate change is to be welcomed."
"However forward-looking the European Union's proposals driven by the desire to combat climate change may be, we are already having to live with the impact of climate change."
"The available data show that some countries are affected to a greater extent than others by the gathering pace of global warming."
"One of these countries is Hungary, where the extent of the change over recent decades has far outstripped the average."
"The fact that this is not simply an abstract phenomenon has been felt by the population of Hungary themselves: the number of droughts has increased, while the amount of rainfall has decreased, with a major impact on agricultural production."
"The most spectacular manifestation of extreme climatic events is probably the record-level floods that have occurred in the Carpathian Basin over the past decade."
"We firmly believe that flood protection is one of the areas where prompt and vigorous action is needed."
"The European Union and the Member States need to pay more attention to ensuring that the increasingly infrequent but all the more torrential rains do not place a strain on our rivers all at once."
"With this in mind, possibilities for natural water storage must be explored in areas of flat, open countryside, while at the same time reducing flood risk by planting forests in hilly areas."
"Let us hope that the decision-makers do not wait until the next time we hear appalling news of floods before opting to take action."
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, climate change is a fact of life."
"Few doubt the findings of the panel of scientists."
"The row is over how we assess the impact and the conclusions drawn."
"The conservationists are right up there with national leaders and a long line of experts, company directors and investors."
"Environmental expertise and ecobusiness have a decisive role to play in overcoming environmental challenges."
"We in Finland have a tendency now to think that investing in wood, pellets, biofuels, and wind and solar power is just a daydream."
"It is like going back to primitive times."
"In California, tapping solar, wind and bioenergy is serious business."
"There, all prudent investors and speculators only invest in renewables when it comes to energy technology."
"Ecobusiness is an important international growth sector and a major employer."
"Companies have never before had a better opportunity to earn money by doing good."
"The global market in eco-business is worth EUR 600 billion."
"The market is growing by 10% a year."
"The fastest growing market is in clean technologies."
"For example, the growth in solar and wind power technologies is 30% per annum."
"Clean technology companies create products and services with a less harmful environmental impact than before."
"Clean technology together with renewable forms of energy makes for a healthier environment, with fewer risks to health."
"The air quality in Beijing is so poor that scientists have calculated that it shortens the life expectancy of the inhabitants of that city by seven years."
"The poor air quality in Brussels shortens life expectancy by seven months."
"A poor environment is therefore a health risk."
"Climate change is also a chance to create new jobs - new green Nokias."
"The IT sector is moving its jobs to Asia; green technology can create new employment for the Finnish people."
"in writing. - (DE) It is clear to all of us that climate change is a major challenge."
"Many parts of the world are already struggling to cope with the negative impacts of the rising global average temperature, and this trend will continue in the coming years."
"People in Europe, too, will feel the threatening effects of climate change on their environment, economy and everyday life."
"A coherent strategy to combat climate change is therefore desirable."
"We must try to tackle climate change on two fronts simultaneously; that is essential."
"Europe must not only drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions; it must also adapt to global warming."
"This is the only way for us to curb the impact of climate change in future."
"More efficient use of energy and our already scarce water resources is one of the measures which must be taken."
"I think it is important that Member States which have already done more than others to combat climate change are not put at a disadvantage."
"All states should be compelled to make an appropriate contribution to mitigating climate change."
"The price of inaction would simply be too high."

"There is one sensitive issue and that is the question of the name."
"We want to make it easier for Macedonia to navigate through these rocky waters, which is why, between now and the next Strasbourg part-session, we want to work with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur to find a solution so that we can take a vote during the next Strasbourg part-session."

"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr Swoboda, this is laughable!"
"Everyone knows that we cannot find a solution within a week."
"This row has been going on for years, and the decision has to be taken: Macedonia is called Macedonia is called Macedonia."
"Greece has to accept that and then we will take a vote."

"(DE) Mr President, I would like to vote in favour of Mr Swoboda's proposal, even if Mr Cohn-Bendit cannot imagine this working, perhaps because it does not sit easily with his style of political work."
"It is possible to achieve compromises within a matter of days, if you take time to seek these compromises, and that is precisely the purpose of Mr Swoboda's proposal."
"Yes, we can vote in the next part-session, but in the intervening period, we could find some kind of compromise for our resolution, given that we seem to be well on the way to doing so here in the House."
"We should take the time to do that, even if Mr Cohn-Bendit feels under pressure."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, although I do not fundamentally disagree with Mr Cohn-Bendit regarding the name, I think that Mr Swoboda's proposal should be adopted."
"I think it would be wise for Parliament to look into this further and to find a solution, and the negotiations, the contacts between Macedonia and Greece, are important in the coming days."

"We would prefer to find a formula which is capable of securing the widest possible support in this House."
"I therefore request that we vote to postpone this vote until Strasbourg: not beyond that, only until Strasbourg."
"Mr Swoboda, we would have come to that when we got to that item on the agenda."

"The European Parliament and the Australian Parliament began their direct and wide-ranging political dialogue in 1981."
"We very much look forward to strengthening and expanding this cooperation even further."
"I wish the delegation every success for the remainder of its stay and a safe journey home when the time comes."

"Combating cancer in the enlarged European Union (vote)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 2"
"Mr President, cancer may cause chronic illness and can possibly lead to disability, therefore in order to make new paragraph 34a more accurate and more credible I propose an oral amendment to include the words 'may include' and 'possibly' in the appropriate areas in that subparagraph."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"

"- Before the vote on Amendment 14"
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, as I see it, the Greens wanted to table an amendment to this, but the aim of this amendment is to include the last part of Amendment 8 in this amendment."
"In other words, it would not disappear from the text."
"The voting list also has Amendment 8 replaced with Amendment 14."
"The intention is not to replace it but for the last part, which starts 'in addition to the short-term development costs', to be included in this report."
"Did everyone understand?"
"I am afraid I did not, either."
"Madam colleague, what do we do now?"
"Did the Greens have something in mind?"
"It seems not, just this once!"
"Could you please repeat what you said, Mrs Myller?"
"Rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, the voting list also has Amendment 8 replaced with Amendment 14."
"The intention is not to replace it but for the last part, which starts 'in addition to the short-term development costs', to be included in this report."
"I have just been told that is not the case."
"Shall we vote on Amendment 14, then?"
"I have just been told by Paul Dunstan, who really is an expert on all these points of detail, that that is not possible."
"He recommends that we simply take the vote now."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 15"
"Mr President, I propose as an oral amendment that Amendment 15 should not replace the original paragraph 51, but be added to that paragraph."
"I understand that the rapporteur agrees with this oral amendment."

"Voting time (continuation)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(PL) Mr President, 2009 will bring many changes and challenges for the European Parliament."
"Not only will elections be held and a new parliamentary term begin, but also, most importantly, the challenges relating to the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty will have to be dealt with."
"Life does not stand still, and I am not referring exclusively to political life."
"There comes a time when changes are needed, along with new plans and approaches to action."
"Generally speaking, greater financial input is required for changes to be effective."
"Nonetheless, the budgetary resources should be administered more efficiently and any unnecessary bureaucracy eliminated."
"(SK) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Paul Rübig, because Eurostars is, in my view, an important initiative of the European Commission to support research and development performing SMEs."
"In spite of the fact that SMEs account for almost 70% of the EU's GDP, their potential in the area of research and development has not yet been sufficiently exploited."
"I would like to underscore the rapporteur's effort to enable the highest possible number of SMEs to participate in this programme."
"According to the original proposal, many SMEs would be excluded from the process since they would have to contribute at least 50% towards the cost of the projects."
"Following the agreement between the European Parliament and the Council, SMEs will be able to participate in, and collaborate on, proposals for projects in the field of research and development."
"I am pleased that Slovakia is among the 29 participating countries that have already expressed support for this programme."
"It is paramount that Slovak SME entrepreneurs receive information on how to access funding for research and development under this programme, and that the research potential grows in Slovakia and in other underdeveloped regions of Europe."
"The European research and innovation database, in which the Commission will publish the results of the projects carried out under this programme, will be a useful point of reference for SMEs."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not speak for a second more, maybe for a second less."
"I merely want to say that it was an honour for me to vote in favour of the report by my friend Paul Rübig, outlining this proposal for a decision aimed at supporting SMEs."
"What I should like, above all else - and this gives me many sleepless nights - is for there to be projects taking into account the experience, capacities and memories of older people, who can teach younger people a great deal in SMEs and so benefit all of the EU countries and the European Union itself."
"Mr President, as you see I still have five seconds left to wish 'buon appetito' to all of my colleagues who have been kind enough to stay behind to listen to my statement."
"(PL) Mr President, any initiatives aimed at supporting and stimulating coal extraction and steel production deserve the European Parliament's support."
"The aforementioned activities are particularly important, because no rapidly developing economy can prosper without these sectors of production."
"It is also worth bearing in mind that the largest producers of these raw materials are located outside the European Union and that in comparison, the position of the Member States is very poor indeed."
"There can be no doubt that the demand for coal and steel will continue to rise, driven by the rapidly developing Asian economies."
"Despite the need to progressively replace coal with renewable and more environmentally-friendly fuels, coal will remain a key source of energy and wealth for many regions of the European Union long into the future."
"Mr President, I voted for Amendment 3, tabled by Mr Szymański, which is a stronger form of our general attitude to avoiding the presence of high-level state leaders at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics."
"Mr Szymański finds a connection between the presence of state leaders and possibly supporting the internal policies of the Chinese authorities."
"I think it might be a warning signal to the Chinese authorities to make this connection more clear."
"That is why I voted for Amendment 3."
"(CS) The European Parliament has once again proved itself to be a standard bearer for the protection of human rights."
"This is because we have achieved a broad political consensus on the condemnation of the human rights violations in China, which, contrary to all expectations, is toughening rather than relaxing the totalitarian regime in the run-up to the Olympics."
"The Olympic Committee is turning a blind eye by asserting that sports and human rights are unrelated."
"I am shocked by this pragmatic approach, which is far from the original ideals of the Olympic Games."
"I call on all Members to appeal in writing to the prime ministers of their governments, as I did, to announce urgently a boycott of the opening ceremony unless China agrees to the dialogue with the Tibetan people and ratifies the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"In my view, the fact that the heads of state of the Member States have not yet resolved to take a common approach can be considered at best misguided, at worst a failure."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union must speak with one voice on such important matters as freedom, democracy and human rights."
"That was why it was so necessary to adopt an unequivocal stance regarding the situation in Tibet and to take decisive measures aimed at persuading China to respect those values."
"It is our moral duty to remind China of the promises it made to global public opinion on the subject of human rights when it was seeking to organise the Olympic Games."
"To date, China has failed to keep any of those promises."
"China is now an economic power that cannot be disregarded."
"It is very wrong, however, for politicians to give priority to achieving specific economic aims and favourable trade agreements over the protection of fundamental values."
"We must put an end to the policy of separating economic issues from human rights in our dealings with China."
"This need not, however, mean being sidelined economically."
"Indeed, the opposite is the case."
"China must be persuaded to commit to international standards and to respect them."
"(PL) Mr President, I work very closely with colleagues from the Croatian Parliament on behalf of the European Parliament, hence my intervention."
"At the very moment it declared independence, Croatia decided that the European Union was the key to its future."
"We should credit the Croatian authorities for all the action they have taken to resolve crucial issues."
"I am referring, for example, to the reform of the public sector and the judicial system, and to the actions aimed at combating corruption."
"Croatia is cooperating closely with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague."
"It is to be commended for the provision included in its Constitution on the integration of national minorities into social and political life."
"Croatia needs the European Union, and the European Union needs Croatia, amongst other reasons because of its geostrategic location."
"Croatia's accession will help to stabilise the Western Balkans and to ensure that democracy develops fully in the region."
"(SL) Mr President, although I hope that Croatia will conclude its negotiations with the European Union as soon as possible, earlier today I withheld my support for Mr Swoboda's report for one particular reason: the amendment, which was endorsed with a majority vote, in my opinion poses a serious concern, because it represents a precedent regarding the European Parliament's decisions, since it speculates about the dates when the negotiations will be concluded."
"Specifically, the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, proposed that the word 'could' be replaced with 'should in any case', which means that he proposes that, in any event, regardless of any benchmarks, the negotiations between Croatia and the European Union ought to be concluded in the year 2009."
"I believe that the European Union has always insisted that the benchmarks ought to be respected, and that this is then a proviso for any negotiations to be concluded."
"However, in his report today, Hannes Swoboda and the European Parliament have declared that irrespective of everything, in any event, the Commission must conclude the negotiations with Croatia by the end of 2009."
"I find this unacceptable."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Lega Nord is voting against the Swoboda report on Croatia, in protest at the rejection of the amendments we tabled in defence of the sacrosanct rights of our Italian, Venetian, minority."
"In the unredeemed lands of Istria and Dalmatia, the people of Fiume and Pola are demanding their rights, rights still being trampled underfoot more than 60 years after the end of the war."
"It is a wound that needs healing."
"Croatia cannot go on being deaf to the cries of anguish of our compatriots, who ask for nothing other than respect for their history, their suffering and their rights."
"It is incredible that our colleagues on the left accuse the Lega Nord, in our country, of lacking a sense of Italian identity and provoke us by saying that our ministers should sing 'Fratelli d'Italia', then in this House, in Strasbourg, when we are discussing the rights of our Italian and Venetian compatriots - persecuted even now and deprived of their fundamental rights - they vote with the heirs of the Titoist persecutors and perpetrators of the Foibe massacres."
"Perhaps what our compatriots are guilty of is being anti-Communist and patriotic, just as we members of the Lega Nord are anti-Communist and patriotic."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on combating cancer in the enlarged Europe because this is a particularly serious problem."
"It affects millions of Europeans, notably in the new Member States."
"Monitoring tests and screening need to be cofinanced or even fully financed at Union level."
"These measures should become a priority for the European Union and should be compulsory for all our citizens."
"The European Commission should prepare a pan-European awareness-raising campaign, providing information on preventive measures, early detection and diagnosis of cancer and its treatment."
"Cancer can only be overcome if we stand shoulder to shoulder and coordinate our efforts."
"The fight against cancer is a difficult challenge, but one to which Europe and the world must rise."
"(PL) Mr President, literature, theatre, architecture, the visual arts, crafts, the cinema and television demonstrate Europe's cultural diversity."
"They are all part of Europe's common cultural heritage even though they belong to specific countries or regions within Europe."
"One of the European Union's aims is to preserve and support this diversity and make it accessible to all."
"This was laid down, for example, in the Maastricht Treaty, in which the cultural dimension of European integration was expressed formally for the first time."
"The European Social Fund supports the Arturo Toscanini Foundation in Italy."
"The Foundation has been running training courses for unemployed musicians since the mid-1990s."
"The Culture Programme is one of the European Union's flagship programmes and runs between 2007 and 2013."
"It has a budget of around EUR 400 million for that period."
"It is a programme for cultural actions that are not of an audio-visual nature."
"I trust we shall persevere in our support for artists and for all actions promoting culture."
"After all, culture is just as important as economic or industrial activity."
"It is for that very reason that I voted in favour of this report."
"Mr President, I have voted in support of the Graça Moura report, as we spend too little time and money on supporting culture."
"We focus on the economy, markets, labour and trade, but where would Europe be without painters, musicians and literary artists?"
"Last night, Commissioner Figeľ told us that culture is more important than business."
"I can only add that culture generates business or, in the words of one historian, 'there would be no mailmen without writers'."
"On the 200th anniversary of the birth of Fryderyk Chopin, the Polish composer, let us show the world that great music and culture was born on this continent."
"(SK) I voted in support of the European agenda for culture in a globalising world, because culture is, in my view, the soul of Europe, and a fundamental source of enrichment for our nations."
"What other continent can claim so many musical geniuses, outstanding painters, sculptors, architects and other internationally renowned artists?"
"Never was culture so prominent in the EU as it is now."
"The effect of the European regions' cultural maturity is illustrated, for example, by the European Capital of Culture scheme for the years 2007 to 2019."
"I have been following with awe the tough contest for the title of European Capital of Culture 2013 between the four Slovak candidates of Košice, Martin, Nitra and Prešov."
"The panel, which will select the winner in September 2008, will have a very difficult task."
"Beautiful and meaningful projects full of cultural treasures will offer sublime experiences to all those who visit these towns."
"You are a wonderful singer, Mrs Pleštinská."
"I have been fortunate enough to hear you sing on several occasions."
"(PT) Mr President, I want to congratulate Mrs Moura on the report adopted today."
"I also want to welcome and draw particular attention to paragraph 26, which was approved overwhelmingly, with 560 votes in favour in the roll-call vote."
"This paragraph highlights the interaction of European languages with other continents, with countries throughout the world, and the fact that it is vital for the European Union to know how to specifically promote these languages and the cultural interaction generated and conveyed by these languages in their extra-European dimensions."
"This is the case with English, Spanish and Portuguese and, to a lesser extent, French."
"I am sure that Commissioner Orban will be able to use this paragraph, together with the Joan i Marí report on which we voted two years ago, to draw up definitive guidelines for the European policy of multilingualism."
"Specific support for the spread of these languages, which are global European languages, is clearly important in the globalised world in which we live."
"(PL) Mr President, climate change represents a challenge for many sectors of the economy."
"It is also a threat to Europe's biodiversity and has a negative impact on social development."
"The only way to counteract the effects of climate change is by limiting greenhouse gas emissions at regional and local level, in every sector of the economy and every area of our lives."
"The European Union should form alliances at global level, notably with developing countries."
"The latter also bear an ever-increasing responsibility for the undue emission of greenhouse gases."
"A further important issue involves improving society's awareness of the adaptation measures by involving the mass media and the citizens in environmental issues."
"Action in this regard should be conducted at global, regional and local level, and should transcend all barriers, political or otherwise."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) We voted in favour of this report on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movements of pet animals, bearing in mind health problems and their possible effects on public health."
"For example, Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council harmonises the rules for non-commercial movements of pet animals between Member States or after their entry or re-entry into the Community from third countries."
"This Regulation introduced, inter alia, the pet passport for movements of cats, dogs and ferrets from one Member State to another."
"This proves that the animal has been vaccinated against rabies."
"However, the Regulation provides for temporary derogations which some Member States can apply until 3 July 2008 (Article 6(1) and Article 16)."
"Article 6(3) provides for the possibility of extending this transitional period by way of legislation, based on a report to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council by the Commission before 1 February 2007."
"This did not happen."
"That is why there is now agreement to extend the transitional period in order to allow time for the new regime to be defined."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Ouský report in order that decisions taken regarding the movement of pets be taken only after full consideration of the scientific assessments."
"in writing. - (SK) This report concerns the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Regulation on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movements of pet animals as regards the extension of the transitional period."
"I am pleased that Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 harmonises the rules for non-commercial movements of pet animals between Member States or after their entry or re-entry into the Community from third countries."
"It is very positive that, in addition to other measures, the pet passport for cats, dogs and ferrets has been introduced, which proves that the animal has been vaccinated against rabies."
"I supported this report because the original transitional period may not be sufficient, especially as there is still no proposal on the table and the European Parliament will be dissolved for the 2009 elections."
"I also believe that it is important for Malta to be included in the list of countries applying special requirements concerning ticks, as Malta already has a special regime in place regarding anti-tick treatment."
"This proposal will facilitate pet owners in that it will make travelling with pet animals a less stressful experience."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Italian colleague, Luciana Sbarbati, which is part of the consultation procedure on the proposal for a Council decision establishing a European Migration Network."
"The need to observe migratory flows dates back to the Commission's first communication in 1994 and led in 2003 to the experimental creation of the European Migration Network (EMN)."
"In order to maintain this essential tool, it was becoming evident that a legal instrument needed to be established."
"In fact, despite the enormous volume of information produced on numerous aspects of international migration, these data are not easy to access."
"In addition, there is not enough reliable, comparable and up-to-date information or analyses of the development of the legal and political situation of immigration and asylum at both national and EU level."
"I support the initiatives aimed at widening this mechanism to include asylum and providing for an extension of the network's mandate."
"in writing. - British Conservatives abstained on this report since, whilst we disagree with its contents, the proposal acknowledges that the United Kingdom is exempt from the provisions."
"It is our long-standing policy not to take a position on issues which do not affect the United Kingdom and from which we have secured an opt-out."
"in writing. - (PT) Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the common European policies on migration and asylum have been constantly developing."
"In this context, it is vital that we can rely on objective, reliable and comparable information and data at national and European level so that we can better understand and analyse the migration phenomena and draw up policies or take decisions based on better information."
"However, the existing data is disparate and in many cases is not reliable, comparable or even up to date."
"The Thessaloniki European Council approved the establishment of a European Migration Network, which started to operate as a pilot project and was then followed by a preparatory action."
"I therefore support this proposal, which aims to consolidate the existing structure, making it permanent and giving it an appropriate legal basis by defining its objectives, functions, structure and methods of financing."
"I agree with the amendments proposed by the rapporteur, in particular the inclusion of asylum in the Network's name and the extension of its mandate."
"I particularly agree that the Council's proposal to only give Parliament a role as observer, without any right to vote, is unacceptable."
"in writing. - (FR) The proposed report is nothing more than a record of the failure of the various European policies implemented and bodies created to date."
"What exactly is its purpose?"
"Its purpose is to create yet another European structure, responsible for collecting, exchanging and using up-to-date data on migratory developments."
"It seems that a central information source is lacking."
"However, what about the activities of the dozens of other national, international and intergovernmental bodies, the European migration agency, the International Organisation for Migration and the Fundamental Rights Agency, which are responsible, in particular, for collecting information on migration?"
"What about Eurostat, Europol, the RAXEN network, Cirefi, etc.?"
"Are they ineffective, obsolete?"
"If the answer is 'yes', why do they get bigger budgets every year?"
"The rapporteur is rightly concerned about the risk of the European Migration Network duplicating the existing structures."
"He should, above all, be concerned about the dangerous drift of the European institutions, which, rather than solving the problems linked to immigration, is only masking the sad reality through a limitless increase in comitology practices and the creation of all sorts of bodies."
"in writing. - (PL) The European Migration Network cannot continue operating without a clear legal basis."
"As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I fully support the report by Mrs Sbarbati proposing acceptance of the Commission's proposal and the general agreement reached in the Council on the subject."
"I believe that the Council's decision will provide an appropriate legal basis, on condition that it takes full account of the opinion of the European Parliament."
"The rapporteur's proposal not to establish a new European monitoring centre for migratory flows is particularly worthy of support."
"The rapporteur suggests instead strengthening the existing system based on a network of National Contact Points."
"I also support the suggestion to increase the network's competence to cover not only migration but also asylum."
"I believe the network's information and research remit should be broadened to cover the production of studies, analyses and assessments concerning the application and implementation of directives."
"I consider that all of the network's activity should be more useful so that the bodies involved in the decision-making process can make practical use of its work."
"It is good that the network will also be responsible for collecting and exchanging information on immigration and asylum."
"This will allow for the exchange and comparison of information, and make it possible to develop common criteria and indicators at European level in the future."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament has today adopted a proposal for a Council decision establishing a European Migration Network."
"The European Migration Network, which started as a pilot project in 2002, is based on a series of National Contact Points."
"Its main objective is to provide 'objective, reliable and comparable information' on the migration and asylum situation in the various Member States."
"This proposal aims to consolidate the existing structure, in the form of a network, without creating, at least for the time being, a new agency or a new observatory at EU level."
"There is no doubt that the measures aimed at improving knowledge of the true migration (and asylum) situation in the various EU countries will be positive."
"However, we do not agree with the fact that this proposal is being used to promote or further the 'Communitisation' of migration and asylum policies, which the Treaty, now known as the 'Lisbon Treaty', aims to encourage and ensure."
"We reject the establishment of common migration and asylum policies at EU level which are security-based, restrictive and profoundly inhuman and which remove such basic responsibilities from the sovereignty of the Member States (and their national parliaments)."
"in writing. - (FR) Cooperation between Member States and the exchange of information are certainly necessary when it comes to immigration policies."
"This is particularly important since the Schengen Agreement doing away with all controls at the Union's internal borders means that the decisions taken in one Member State, especially those concerning the regularisation of illegal immigrants, have consequences for, and in, neighbouring countries."
"If there is one area in which Europe excels, it is in the creation of agencies, bodies and all kinds of structures, provided with staff and a budget, which justify the Union's action and give the appearance of wanting to resolve the problems."
"That is not the case at all, however."
"This is particularly true when it comes migration, for which the plethora of existing structures, be they governmental, non-governmental or intergovernmental, sit side by side without any conclusive results."
"Research centres, professional bodies, the European migration observatory, Eurostat, Europol, the Fundamental Rights Agency, the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (Cirefi), and so on: the list is never-ending."
"This report seeks to add an umpteenth: a European Migration Network, the supposed first stage before the creation of a new European observatory or agency."
"It is time to curb this Europe of excess and pretence."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague and friend Ingeborg Grässle, which is part of the consultation procedure on the draft Commission regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EC) No 1653/2004 on a standard financial regulation for the executive agencies pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes."
"I support the rapporteur's proposals aimed at harmonising the deadlines for the discharge procedure and bringing the text of the standard financial regulation for the executive agencies into line with the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities."
"I also support the proposal aimed at clarifying the data to be contained in the establishment plan with regard to temporary and contract staff as well as seconded national experts so that the budgetary authority has a clear insight into the changes in each agency's 'personnel' budget."
"The proposal to formalise the requirement for the authorising officer, i.e. the director of the agency, to be ultimately responsible is also valid."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague and friend Ingeborg Grässle, which is part of the consultation procedure on the draft Commission regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EC) No 1653/2004 on a standard financial regulation for the executive agencies pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes."
"I agree that we need to harmonise the discharge deadlines and clarify that the Community agencies that actually receive contributions from the budget under Article 185(1) of the general Financial Regulation are all the Community bodies that receive direct subsidies from the budget and all the other Community bodies that receive financial support from the budget."
"It is also important to indicate the data that need to be contained in the establishment plan, in terms of both temporary and contract staff and seconded national experts, so that the budgetary authority has a clear insight into the changes in each agency's 'personnel' budget, and to improve and strengthen the responsibility of the authorising officer."
"in writing. - (PT) The bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 - in other words, Community agencies - have multiplied in recent years (with the creation of many others being predicted), becoming increasingly supranational and performing functions which are the responsibility of each Member State."
"This report makes some improvements to the text proposed by the European Commission, particularly by including in the financial regulation of these bodies the obligation to make available on their Internet sites information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from their budgets."
"This information shall be 'easily accessible to third parties, transparent and comprehensive'."
"This is something that the current Regulation does not contemplate."
"However, despite also demanding more detailed information on the staff, budget and work carried out by these agencies, the Commission's proposal agrees to give these agencies greater room for manoeuvre in terms of transfers of appropriations which must be duly monitored."
"in writing. - (PT) The economic difficulties faced by the fishing industry are the result of an unclear and inefficient system, which is based, inter alia, on the system of TACs (Total Allowable Catch), quotas and management of fishing effort."
"The Commission communication on 'improving the economic situation in the fishing industry' mentions the difficulties faced by the industry and identifies some new approaches for fisheries management."
"These include management of 'fishing rights'."
"This debate is extremely important to the Community fishing industry as it opens the door to greater biological sustainability of resources and more opportunity for those responsible for the industry to intervene in the market."
"There is a wide variety of fishing rights and transaction systems that are not always totally transparent."
"We must therefore engage in serious debate so that ways of managing these rights, which are capable of ensuring transparency, legal certainty and economic efficiency for fishermen, can be assessed."
"As fishing rights form the backbone of fisheries management in the leading countries in terms of fishing potential (US, New Zealand, Norway, etc.), it is totally appropriate to discuss this possibility in the Community's fisheries management."
"Due to all the above, the Members of the Portuguese Social Democratic Party support the Attwooll report."
"in writing. - (PT) The speech by Commissioner Borg was illuminating in terms of the Commission's intentions for the future of the common fisheries policy: namely, alteration of its management system by introducing, in stages, a Community system based on fishing rights."
"We could almost have predicted its intentions: initially to extend the application of this system, although only to part of the fleet, in a large number of Member States, and then, subsequently, to create a single EU market in fishing rights, possibly with their transaction on a stock exchange."
"The objectives indicated by the European Commission '... may lead to large-scale buying of rights, resulting in concentration of ownership of quotas, geographical distribution of fishing activity and fleet composition', where '... any mechanisms established to limit the negative effects ... should be compatible with Community single market and competition rules'."
"This is an extremely important issue which goes to the heart of the Member States' sovereignty and also the ownership and management of the right to exploit a natural resource, in other words the transfer to private interests of rights to exploit a public asset."
"We can but categorically reject this intention!"
"in writing. - I abstained on the Attwooll report because, whilst I could agree with much of it, it failed to address the fundamental problem with our current fisheries management system: the fact that Europe's waters are governed centrally in the form of the CFP."
"The report states that marine biological resources are a 'common public good', but fails to recognise that these resources are best managed by Europe's fishing nations."
"The report states that 'fishing right management mechanisms should be adopted at Community level', when the reality shows that Community management of fisheries has been an unmitigated disaster."
"Different management tools should be studied with a view to ensuring the long-term viability of Europe's fishing communities, but the key decisions relating to these tools should be the responsibility of the fishing nations, not the European institutions."
"in writing. - (EL) The debate on the exchange between Member States and the Commission of knowledge and experience about the management systems of each state will not provide special data enabling common management measures to be taken."
"Such management systems come under the jurisdiction of the Member States, and rightly so: they concern the history, society, economy, geography and hydrology of each country."
"It is right to point out that marine biology resources are a common public good and that such rights ought not to be interpreted as property rights."
"However, the idea of finding successful management systems based on fishing rights within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy at EU level is utopian and self-deluding, because the system itself, with its unbalanced development, does not permit the attainment of such a goal."
"The fisheries sector is not independent of the wider economic situation of each Member State, nor do the working methods of professionally active fishermen remain unaffected by social and political developments, both locally and internationally."
"Research and debate will simply demonstrate that we cannot possibly expect any improvement in the economic situation of fishermen and, more broadly, the development of local communities reliant on fishing while we are pursuing a Common Fisheries Policy in order to merge fishing enterprises into business groups and, more generally, to pool capital."
"in writing. - The idea of launching a discussion on the future of rights-based management systems within the common fisheries policy is one I support."
"Ms Attwooll's report on rights-based management tools in fisheries should therefore be welcomed."
"The issues raised by such discussions will make for lively and constructive debate in seeking simplification of the CFP."
"I voted in favour of Ms Attwooll's recommendations."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague Reimer Böge on the proposal for a decision on the mobilisation, in the framework of the general budget of the European Union for 2008, of a sum of EUR 3 106 882 in commitment and payment appropriations under the auspices of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"This decision must take account of the fact that on 12 September 2007 Malta submitted an application for mobilisation of the Fund for 675 redundancies in the textile sector, specifically for workers made redundant by VF (Malta) Ltd and Bortex Clothing Ind."
"Co Ltd. The Maltese authorities requested a contribution of EUR 681 207 in order to cover a part of costs of the support measures, estimated at some EUR 1.36 million."
"In addition, on 9 October 2007 Portugal submitted a request for mobilisation of the Fund for 1 546 redundancies in the automobile sector, specifically for workers made redundant by Opel in Azambuja, Alcoa Fujikura in Seixal and Johnson Controls in Portalegre."
"The Portuguese authorities requested EUR 2 425 675 to cover a part of the costs of the support measures, estimated at some EUR 4.85 million."
"in writing. - (PT) Following the redundancies in 2007 of 1 549 workers from Opel Portugal in Azambuja, from Alcoa Fujikura in Seixal and from Johnson Controls in Portalegre, the Portuguese Government submitted an application for the mobilisation of this Fund (EUR 2 425 675) to cofinance actions such as 'vocational training and skills certification' and wage compensation to 'encourage' workers to accept lower wages."
"Undoubtedly, given the serious consequences for workers, their families and the regions in which these companies are based, any measure which aims to minimise these consequences is urgent and necessary."
"However, this does not solve the basic problem of the creation and guarantee of jobs with rights for workers and the assurance of socio-economic development in these regions."
"This is only possible through a proper investment policy which takes advantage of the potential in each region and which prevents multinationals from relocating or closing down in search of more people and places to exploit after receiving millions of euros in 'aid'."
"Regrettably, Parliament has adopted a resolution which, as regards the Portuguese application, stresses its 'concern' about the nature of the measures financed and asks the Commission 'in cooperation with the Portuguese authorities, to closely monitor the situation'."
"This has not happened with previous applications, such as those of France or Germany."
"in writing. - I welcome the first mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for the 2008 budgetary year."
"The Party of European Socialists was very active in setting up this fund and it is an essential contribution to efforts aimed at alleviating the effects of globalisation on workers."
"I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (PT) In 2006 I fought hard for the establishment of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"When it was approved, I made a speech to the House in which I said that this decision had a political angle: for the first time, the three European institutions - the Council, the Commission and Parliament - had acknowledged the existence of the negative aspects of globalisation, which was why workers affected by company closures due to globalisation should be financially supported."
"I believed that this was a way for the European Union to show its presence on the ground among those suffering from redundancies due to the closure of companies, as has happened in Portugal with Opel, Johnson and Alcoa Fujikara."
"These are often dramatic situations, which is why the European Parliament's decision to make available to these workers nearly EUR 2.5 million may help to alleviate their current anxieties."
"When people are worried and fearful, it is difficult to accept change."
"These payments decided today and destined for these Portuguese workers are not a miracle solution but are definitely a way of helping them to have more confidence in themselves so that, with this support from the European Union, they can find reasons to smile again."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my excellent Polish colleague Janusz Lewandowski on the 2009 budget guidelines for the 'other sections', namely the European Parliament, but also the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"This document outlines the major challenges that will be on Parliament's agenda between now and 2009, notably the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Every effort must be made to ensure that Parliament's enhanced responsibilities following the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty are taken into account in the budget."
"Measures must be taken to improve communication with the citizens, especially at local level and on three projects: the Visitors' Centre, the Audiovisual Centre and the Web TV project."
"Finally, I wonder whether, prior to the budgetary procedures, we should perhaps carry out an audit of the human resources allocated to European parliamentary activities."
"The European Parliament's political responsibilities are constantly increasing and it is crucial that the Members have the means to work completely independently."
"in writing. - (PT) This report marks the start of the debate on the 2009 budget procedure with regard to the budget of the European Parliament and other institutions, but not including that of the European Commission, which is by far the largest budget."
"Among other aspects that we could highlight, consideration must be given to the guidelines now proposed on staff policy."
"This is because in recent years we have witnessed constant pressure to reduce staff costs, with the use of forms of precarious contracting, such as contracting via the provision of outside services, particularly through temporary employment agencies, to the detriment of permanent employment contracts and the rights of these workers."
"We must of course categorically reject this approach."
"Another recurring aspect is the need to ensure the diversity and availability of all the official and working languages of the EU."
"During the 2008 budget procedure, a small appropriation was placed in the reserve 'to encourage the administration to give priority to more efficient linguistic support for Members during official meetings'."
"However, we do not know what measures were actually taken in this respect, particularly as situations continue to arise in which this right is not respected, for example in the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assemblies."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed Austrian colleague Paul Rübig, which is part of the codecision procedure on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the participation by the Community in a research and development programme aimed at supporting research and development performing SMEs undertaken by several Member States."
"I welcome this initiative aimed at adding EUR 100 million over six years to the EUR 300 million of appropriations under the EUROSTARS Joint Programme for numerous Member States and other members of the European Economic Area for innovative SMEs in order to catch up in this area."
"It is very interesting to note that 82% of the large US companies set up after 1980 were created from nothing while in the EU the same figure is only 37%."
"It is therefore clear that small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those that are innovative, offer considerable hope for economic growth and social progress in our internal market."
"in writing.- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am voting in favour of this report, which makes a further important contribution to developing research and innovation, and hence the competitiveness of products made in Europe."
"I welcome the fact that funding is to be allocated to SMEs, which represent the vital connective tissue of the Italian and European economies and were in need of more substantial financial support geared to the creation of original, high-quality products capable of standing up to competition from emerging economies."
"The EU's creative potential must be supported and boosted so as to facilitate innovation in our internal market, without, however, running the risk in the near future of facing charges related to intellectual property rights which could be claimed by non-European countries."
"New competitors, such as China, Japan and India, are making a grand entrance on the international economic stage, compelling the world market to confront the challenge of fresh competition based on innovation."
"EU cofinancing of the Eurostars programme in favour of SMEs therefore constitutes an essential step towards ensuring that the EU Member States remain competitive in the medium and long term."
"Furthermore, I am pleased with the success achieved in the negotiations on the compromise package, which, by improving the access criteria for SMEs, will enable them to innovate in a way that will contribute to the success and the very survival of European SMEs."
"in writing. - (PT) In theory this is an important programme, given that it aims to support research and development performing SMEs, as it is in enterprises, particularly the smaller ones, where investments in R&D have the greatest multiplying effect and which, at the same time, have the greatest need."
"However, we do not feel that the programme can effectively deliver because:"
"The programme has been allocated absolutely derisory and even ridiculous funds - EUR 400 million of which only EUR 100 million originate from the EU - which means that this proposal is pure propaganda."
"However, at the same time, the fact that only a very small number of enterprises will benefit from this programme in the future has been concealed."
"The proposal will only benefit the most powerful and skilled medium-sized enterprises, in other words those with more than 250 workers, so that over 80% of European enterprises, mainly composed of micro and small enterprises, will be excluded."
"As Portugal is one of the European countries where there is a dramatic lack of investment in R&D in enterprises, we feel that if the Eurostars programme were to come to our country its effects would be totally irrelevant and residual."
"in writing. - I welcome Mr Rubig's proposals to support research and development performing SMEs."
"The plan to inject EUR 400 million into encouraging such SMEs to conduct market-orientated research in transnational projects should be supported and I voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (FR) I want to express my support for the Rübig report, which seeks to increase the number of SMEs that are eligible for support for their R&D projects under the Eurostars research and development programme implemented by several Member States and associate countries."
"It also aims to facilitate the participation of our SMEs, which are the real catalysts of the European economy, in this programme."
"I welcome, too, the fact that in the future Luxembourg will also participate in the Eurostars programme, which will help us to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy."
"in writing. - (PT) I support the content of this report as I consider that its proposals are intended to encourage research and development in SMEs, which represent over 99% of all enterprises in Europe and which employ over 60% of the working population."
"The report adds that the number of SMEs engaged in research and development activities is very limited and we must therefore encourage, through all available means, this type of initiative, which will become increasingly decisive in consolidating their competitiveness."
"In this respect, the most decisive aspect is not covered by this report."
"It is vital that multiplying effects are created, which, through modern forms of business management, may lead to processes that can create value through incorporated innovation and efficiency."
"This creation of value must benefit not only the enterprises where this is developed, but also the whole business fabric, both upstream and downstream."
"The adoption of this report must not make us forget the need to reinforce the financial support mechanisms for start-ups, an area where many difficulties still exist, particularly for young entrepreneurs who want to start a business experiment."
"I would stress that red tape must be removed from these processes so that SMEs do not shy away from a commitment to research and development."
"in writing. - (SK) By voting for Paul Rübig's report, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises can often be effective participants in research and development but they have to put up with less favourable conditions than those that apply to large international corporations."
"From now on, SME associations performing research and development can avail of financial support from Europe and operate within a European network together with other small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Slovak SMEs will thus be able to contribute their knowledge and capacities to the European research and development sector."
"In Slovakia many small and medium-sized enterprises are located in rural areas with less developed infrastructure, which hampers their development."
"Many women are employed in research and development performing SMEs, whether directly or indirectly."
"European funds are useful because they give SMEs a start, thus allowing their professional capacities to serve the common interest."
"The Eurostars programme is a programme for researching and developing new products and services at European Union level."
"SMEs play a key role in Eurostars projects."
"It is a real pity that the Slovak Republic, an EU Member State, does not participate in this programme."
"Slovakia's small and medium-sized enterprises consequently have no access to the significant financial support available for the effective development of new products, techniques and services."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council decision on the multiannual technical guidelines for the research programme of the Research Fund for Coal and Steel - C6-0248/2007 -."
"I support the view presented by Mr Gierek, who argued that in the light of the Fund's role in ensuring proper development of the European Union's economy, especially in the new Member States, the Fund should continue to operate."
"Steel is still one of the key raw materials for the machinery and construction industries."
"It is also the case that the technical possibilities of improving its quality and the efficiency of its manufacture are far from having been exhausted."
"As has been rightly emphasised, greater competitiveness of coal on the energy market depends on efficient exploitation of regional resources."
"This will make a tremendous contribution to increasing energy security for the territory of the European Union."
"in writing. - I voted in support of Mr Gierek's report on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel."
"The report's proposals will allow for a greater focus on environmental concerns and will enable the coal and steel sector to investigate ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"in writing. - I will be voting in favour of this report and I think it is important that we take the opportunity to look in more detail at the use of coal as part of our energy needs."
"For too long coal has been seen as a dirty fuel and scant regard has been given to the possibility of cleaning up coal by use of new technologies."
"My own region of the North-West of England still sits on huge reserves of quality coal that is deemed too expensive to extract, and whilst it is true that coal in its purest form is not an environmentally-friendly fuel, new, clean coal technology now exists that would enable coal to play a key role in our energy supply whilst not destroying the environment in the process."
"We need to use our coal reserves better."
"We need to find more research money to make coal more environmentally friendly and more economically competitive."
"We need to do more to revive our coal-mining communities."
"I believe clean coal does have a future and I thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for its report which at least starts this discussion going."
"in writing. - Both coal and steel have been very important industries to communities in the south-east of England, especially in Kent."
"I welcome this report which promotes a research fund to develop elements of these industries inside the EU, as we need answers to our future energy needs."
"In particular, making coal an environmentally more accepted fuel could help secure our energy needs in the future when Europe could be under greatest stress from uncertain supply conditions."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the report by Mr Gierek on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel."
"Pursuant to the Council's guidelines, after operating for five years the Research Fund for Coal and Steel was reviewed this year."
"The review focused on efficient use of energy materials and environmental protection."
"It should be emphasised that one of the Fund's great advantages is that it can be used as a source of supplementary finance for research not covered by the Seventh Framework Programme."
"In addition, pursuant also to the European Commission's stance, the Fund should continue to operate, because steel is still one of the principal raw materials for the machinery and construction industries, and these sectors require constant investment in research."
"The Fund will also facilitate better use of coal on the energy market, which will make a significant contribution to the European Union's energy security."
"It should, however, be remembered that extraction of this raw material requires ongoing exploratory surveys."
"Another important issue is the introduction of the principle of gender equality into the research teams."
"This will make a positive contribution to increasing the involvement of women in the area."
"in writing. - (PT) According to information provided by the Commission, 40% of the total EU fleet in terms of vessel tonnage operate on the high seas or in the waters of third countries."
"Likewise, vessels from other countries also fish in EU waters, notably under the terms of the so-called 'northern agreements'."
"It is thus very important for the EU to have a clear system for authorising both types of activity."
"The legislative proposal and Parliament's report are part of the EU's efforts to 'simplify' the common fisheries policy (CFP) by laying down general rules and conditions for applying for, and issuing, licences to fish, both inside and outside EU waters."
"The Commission proposal clarifies the responsibilities of the Commission and Member States and specifies the reporting requirements of fishing activities."
"The amendments made by Parliament's report make the document fairer in certain respects."
"An example of this is the greater flexibility introduced with regard to the eligibility criteria in Article 7."
"The Members of the Portuguese Social Democratic Party therefore support the Morillon report."
"in writing. - (PT) At the moment, authorisations for fishing activities to be granted to Community fishing vessels or third country vessels are managed through various bilateral agreements or Regional Fisheries Management Organisations."
"This proposal for a regulation aims to establish a single procedure for managing all fishing authorisations, clearly indicating the role of the European Commission in granting or suspending these authorisations, instead of the Member States."
"Among many important aspects that deserve comment or criticism, we would highlight that, despite this report clarifying certain aspects of the proposal for a regulation, such as regarding as serious infringements only those infringements which have been effectively confirmed as such in accordance with the relevant national legislation - which we regard as positive - it still does not safeguard the sovereignty of each Member State in terms of the management of fishing activities in their EEZs (Exclusive Economic Zones), with which we disagree."
"That is why we tabled an amendment which argued for the Member States, as interested parties, to be active participants in the procedures, in particular decision-making procedures for the granting of authorisations in this area."
"Regrettably the amendment was rejected by a majority of this House."
"in writing. - I voted against the Morillon report, because a number of amendments which I co-signed were voted down."
"In particular, amendments relating to the reallocation of fishing opportunities were defeated."
"My own hostility to the disastrous CFP has been well documented in this House and I believe that fisheries management should be returned to Europe's fishing nations."
"However, for as long as we have a common policy, the principle of relative stability must remain inviolable and all of Europe's fishing communities must be assured that their historic fishing rights will remain their own."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters - C6-0236/2007 -."
"Mr Morillon rightly emphasised that it is very important for the European Union to have a clear system for authorising both types of activities, with a view to achieving the maximum level of compliance with Union provisions in the area of fisheries and also to provide greater transparency for the activities of EU vessels in the waters of third countries."
"Furthermore, there can be no doubt that the priority given by the Commission and the European Union to combating IUU fishing, and the significant reduction of fish stocks of developing countries caused by vessels engaged in IUU fishing merits our highest attention."
"in writing. - The goal of Mr Morillon's report should have been to simplify the common fisheries policy."
"I am not convinced that the report's initial proposals met this requirement."
"The inclusion of agreements that fall under Article 63 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea would produce great practical difficulties for the Scottish fishing industry."
"Provisions pertaining to utilisation appear to already form part of existing third-country fisheries partnership agreements and the report's recommendations only serve to further complicate matters in this area."
"My vote reflected these concerns."
"in writing. - On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party, I am writing to explain why we tabled and supported amendments 20-23 on the Morillon report, and, when the amendments, fell, voted against the amended report and legislative resolution."
"Amendments 20, 21, and 22 relate to the scope of the regulation."
"It is important to maintain the distinction between agreements that are covered by article 63 rather than 62 of UNCLOS."
"Only the latter should be the subject of this proposal."
"Amendment 23 deletes the power given to the Commission to re-allocate fishing opportunities as proposed in Article 13, preserving the principle of relative stability and historic fishing rights in a context of responsible fishing."
"Today's vote should be a wake-up call to all those who are concerned about the conservation of vulnerable fishing stocks."
"It shows that the European Parliament is in favour of the European Commission reallocating fishing quotas, which would result in a free-for-all in the North Sea."
"This goes against the principle of relative stability and is detrimental to Scottish fishing interests."
"We had no other option but to vote against this report."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats support the European Parliament's wish in 2008, the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, to invite a number of the world's religious leaders for a dialogue with MEPs."
"We want to stress, however, that this dialogue should take the form of discussions and exchanges of view in the committees, or it should take place in specially arranged meetings."
"One-sided speeches to Members sitting in plenary, without any possibility for dialogue and questions, are not the right medium for communication and intercultural exchanges."
"in writing. - The original compromise resolution was in my opinion not entirely balanced."
"The initial disturbances in Lhasa and elsewhere were orchestrated attacks on people and premises with arson, injury and murder of Han Chinese and the Muslim minority."
"In my own country this would, if it had been white youth against our migrant community, have been described as race riots."
"Nevertheless on balance I could have supported it."
"China still fails to fully respect human rights across its territory, with respect to independent trade unions, internal migrants and the practice of minority religions."
"However, the amendments from the right that have passed pushed this text beyond the fringe."
"The rejection of the EU's 'one China policy', the demands for a dialogue 'without preconditions' made it impossible for me to support the resolution even with my agreement on the human rights elements contained within the resolution, as I indicated by my roll-call votes."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of a joint resolution by all the political groups on Tibet."
"This text condemns the recent repression in Tibet and follows on from this Parliament's previous resolutions calling on both parties to engage in dialogue."
"We also call on the Chinese Government and the supporters of the Dalai Lama to end all violence."
"The Chinese Government must not misuse the 2008 Olympic Games by arresting dissidents, journalists and human rights activists."
"We call on the EU Presidency-in-Office to strive to find a common EU position with regard to the attendance of the heads of state or government and the EU High Representative at the Olympic Games opening ceremony, with the option of non-attendance in the event that there is no resumption of dialogue between the Chinese authorities and His Holiness the Dalai Lama."
"in writing. - (SV) The Olympic torch continues its journey round the globe and demonstrations all over the world have shown what people feel about this summer's Olympic Games."
"It is a question in which many are interested, and it is important that the Member States be left to decide for themselves whether to participate in or boycott the Olympic Games in China."
"The fight for human rights is crucial and should be supported, but the work must take place through the UN in order to acquire the necessary legitimacy."
"Unfortunately the European Parliament is exploiting the current situation in Tibet in order to advance its foreign policy positions."
"The situation must be resolved between China and Tibet without interference from the European Parliament, which has no powers in this area."
"in writing. - (PT) While expressing our sympathy for the victims, our desire that the conflicts should be peacefully resolved and our principles of the defence of democracy, human rights and international law, we feel that once again a resolution on the situation in Tibet contains elements that do not strictly correspond to the situation as it is actually developing."
"It is increasingly evident that what is actually in hand is an operation against the Beijing Olympic Games; this is the real motivation behind the escalation in provocation and much of the hypocritical indignation expressed."
"Once again, arguments are being manipulated to justify current and future interference and infringements of international law, with attempts to impose strategic and economic interests against China."
"It is significant that we are still talking about Tibet as a territory occupied by China when the powers instigating and supporting the separatist movements which are at the root of the violent actions are not challenging the integrity of the territory of the People's Republic of China, including Tibet as an Autonomous Region."
"Finally, what morals can this House have in adopting such a resolution when, less than a month ago, it adopted a report on Iraq without a single mention of the aggression and occupation by the US?"
"in writing. - (FR) Given the gravity of the situation in Tibet, the European Parliament could stay silent no longer."
"I therefore supported this resolution, which strongly condemns the brutal repression in this region by the Chinese security forces."
"The violence that has taken place in the streets of Lhasa and Dharamsala and the censorship of foreign media are intolerable and our institution must, together with the international community, use all of its influence to ensure that it stops and that China respects its international commitments in the field of human rights and minorities."
"Through my vote I also wished to express my solidarity with the people of Tibet, most of whom are not demanding independence but greater political autonomy and respect for their cultural and linguistic heritage."
"I am not in favour of a complete boycott of the Beijing Olympics because, in my view, dialogue is always preferable to closure."
"I believe, however, that these Games are an opportunity to encourage the Chinese authorities to make progress on the road to democracy, and I hope, as stated in the resolution, that the EU heads of state or government will adopt a consistent common position in relation to this event."
"in writing. - I condemn the Chinese armed forces' repression of Tibetan protestors."
"Indeed, this issue underlines the need for a common EU approach to China."
"It is only through such a coherent approach that cooperation can constructively move forward."
"The Beijing Olympics are a prime opportunity to push for progress on issues such as human rights and media freedoms in China."
"Any attempts by the Chinese Government to hinder protests or reporting for these ends would be regrettable."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (DE) It was entirely predictable that China would react to demonstrations by deploying the military and the police."
"China is of course not a democracy, but the response of the Chinese security forces to the demonstrators is naturally to be condemned."
"A boycott of the Olympic Games, in whatever form, would in all probability simply be viewed as an insult by the Chinese majority population and would certainly not improve - and, in the worst case scenario, might actually exacerbate - the situation of minorities in that country."
"Given the EU's weight in the international arena, 'go-it-alone' approaches by the EU are highly unlikely to have any effect."
"If the EU presses ahead and makes itself a laughing stock in the eyes of the world, that would help no one, especially not the Tibetans."
"Even if the situation calms down, new and perhaps even more violent unrest can be predicted."
"Together with allies, however, the EU can make efforts to improve the life of the minorities in China on a progressive basis and gradually bring about a change in attitude in the government and the majority population."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the firm stance our House took today in relation to a situation that has existed in Tibet for decades but deteriorated significantly a month ago."
"Defending our values - both European and universal - means that silence is out of the question: I thus fully support the condemnations of the 'brutal repression visited by the Chinese security forces on Tibetan demonstrators' as well as 'all acts of violence from whichever source' that have taken place in recent days."
"Parliament also makes a number of requests to the Chinese authorities, calling on them, in particular, to authorise an independent international inquiry into the violence in Tibet, to open a constructive dialogue without preconditions with the Tibetans, to release immediately the peaceful demonstrators and all dissidents arrested in China, and to honour the human rights commitments it made to the IOC and to the world in 2001."
"Finally, the resolution calls on the EU heads of state or government to adopt a common position on their participation in the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games."
"in writing. - As Head of the Romanian Socialist Delegation, I would like to explain the Delegation's negative vote on the Resolution on Tibet."
"In fact, the resolution is not defending human rights and we cannot accept that human rights fall hostage to geopolitical agendas and interests."
"It is lenient with respect to human rights and hypocritical, because it is forceful in proposing political solutions that do not take into account the realities in China."
"Through this resolution, the EU is losing its credibility, promoting in reality, behind its statements of support for human rights, a dangerous agenda of ""political autonomy"" and independence for Tibet, in clear contradiction to the ""One-China policy"" principle."
"At the same time, the EU is losing its encouraging influence on China in the process of opening."
"Consequently, the resolution stands for the partition of China and not for the support and promotion of human rights, which are being used as a pretext for pushing forward different geopolitical agendas."
"in writing. - I completely support Tibet in this situation."
"However, I could not support this motion for a resolution, as an amendment to respect the 'one China' policy principle was passed by the majority of my colleagues."
"I do not support this particular amendment, as the 'one China' policy threatens Taiwan as well as Tibet."
"I have in the past called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics on the basis of human rights."
"in writing. - (PL) I was part of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs that visited Zagreb at the beginning of this year."
"I agree with the rapporteur on the issues detailed in the report discussed yesterday, and therefore voted in favour of adoption of Mr Swoboda's report today."
"I should like to congratulate the Croatian authorities on the positive results they have achieved so far in preparation for membership of the European Union."
"in writing. - (FR) Although I voted in favour of the progress report on Croatia's potential accession, I must stress that no future accessions can take place in the near future."
"The Union of 27 must firstly organise itself on the basis of the Lisbon Treaty."
"New accessions will only be possible after consolidation of the EU in its current configuration."
"in writing. - (SV) Junilistan considers that the enlargement of the EU is a fundamental aspect of the work to achieve peace and stability in Europe."
"We therefore support EU membership for Croatia when the country meets the Copenhagen criteria."
"We have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"However, it is absurd for the European Parliament to demand that the media take steps to maintain popular support for the role of the International Criminal Tribunal."
"This kind of utterance can be interpreted quite simply as interference with press freedom."
"We are also critical of formulations to the effect that the European Parliament should call on Croatia to conduct an awareness-raising campaign aimed at focusing public attention on the environment."
"This question is of course important in itself, but it falls outside the powers of the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (PT) It will be said that the effects of the recent NATO Summit in Bucharest made themselves felt in the vote of this House today."
"In other words, Croatia has seen the adoption of the report on its 'progress' towards accession to the EU - with it even being explicitly stated that the negotiations shall (!) be concluded before the 2009 elections - whereas the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has seen the vote on its progress report postponed."
"It will be recalled that the NATO Summit decided to invite Croatia to begin accession talks, whilst those with the FYROM were postponed."
"If there is one aspect that this situation once again highlights, it is that the enlargement of the EU and NATO occurs in harmony."
"Among other important aspects that should be highlighted in this explanation of vote (such as the current border disputes between countries in the region, including Italy), it is noted that progress towards accession to the EU means, according to the European Commission, that the 'economic criteria', in other words 'a budgetary consolidation and stability policy', 'structural reform of public finances', 'privatisation' and 'improving the quality of business environments', and land reform (which means access to land ownership, particularly by foreigners), must be achieved."
"Two examples of the EU at its best ..."
"in writing. - Mr Swoboda's report on Croatia is a well-balanced report that outlines an optimistic view of Croatia's efforts towards EU accession."
"It is nevertheless realistic and does point to the need for continued effort by the Croatian Government on judicial and border issues."
"I welcome the country's efforts towards accession and hope for these to continue."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (PT) We voted in favour of this motion for a resolution given the current situation and the estimates of the International Agency for Research on Cancer."
"These indicate that one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dies from the disease."
"In 2006 there were nearly 2.3 million new cancer cases and over 1 million cancer deaths within the EU."
"Cancer is caused by many factors in multiple stages and therefore requires more prevention that addresses lifestyle causes and occupational and environmental causes on an equal footing."
"According to a recent study by the trade unions, at least 8% of annual cancer deaths are directly caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace and this exposure could be prevented by substitution of carcinogens with less harmful substances."
"It is well known that there are startling differences in the quality of cancer treatment facilities, screening programmes, evidence-based best practice guidelines, facilities for radiotherapy and access to new anti-cancer drugs, which also explains the big differences in the five-year survival rate from most cancers across Europe."
"in writing. - (SV) Are EU measures in the urgent fight against cancer more effective than corresponding measures in the context of existing international organisations with broad expertise, such as the WHO?"
"Do the EU institutions have more extensive competence than the Member States in methods of combating cancer?"
"Our answer to these questions is 'no'."
"The Resolution calls, among other things, for an interinstitutional EU Cancer Task Force, EU-sponsored information and education campaigns on cancer, an advisory committee on cancer prevention to be set up by the Commission, legislative action by the EU to encourage and support initiatives concerned with the lack of sun protection, action by the Commission to create smoke-free environments, nationwide provision by the Member States for multidisciplinary oncology teams and recognition of oncology as a medical speciality."
"The idea behind these views and demands is certainly laudable."
"The fundamental question, however, is: what value added is there in having the EU regulate all these things?"
"Where is trust in the Member States?"
"What happened to the subsidiarity principle?"
"Does EU regulatory action really benefit those who are in need of qualitative legislation and well-considered measures, namely cancer patients?"
"Where is the realisation that cancer is a global problem, which should be approached at a global level?"
"On the basis of the above arguments, Junilistan voted against the report in question in the final vote."
"in writing. - I fully support the motion for a resolution brought before Parliament by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety relating to combating cancer."
"The EU has an important role to play in coordinating the fight against a disease which one in three Europeans will be diagnosed with in the course of their lifetimes."
"Member States also clearly have a key role in cancer prevention, diagnosis and treatment amongst their citizens and must learn from each other in order to combat the disease."
"Just this week, the Scottish Government announced a national programme to immunise schoolgirls against Human Papilloma Virus, the cause of the majority of cervical cancer cases, and it is programmes such as this which the EU should encourage all Member States to adopt."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of adoption of the resolution on combating cancer as diseases of this type wreak havoc the world over, including the countries of the European Union and my home country, Poland."
"Widespread and regular preventive checks enable this disease to be detected in its initial stages, which significantly increases the chance of recovery."
"A less restrictive exchange of experiences between oncology centres is needed so that the knowledge gained most recently on the subject can be applied extensively."
"Much concern has been expressed recently about the increase in the number of cases of breast cancer."
"It is therefore essential to spread awareness of the danger and provide universal access to professional mammogram testing."
"It is also especially important to limit people's contact with carcinogenic products."
"In particular, consideration should be given to the preservatives used in the food industry and to the inappropriate use of artificial fertilisers and plant protection products."
"Asbestos also merits attention because until recently it was used in the construction industry and in water supply pipes."
"Anti-nicotine preventive measures must form part of this action, too."
"in writing. - (SK) Ladies and gentlemen, today none of us can say that the fight against cancer does not concern us."
"I am not a medical expert in oncology, but having lost both my parents and a young brother to cancer I have witnessed the aggressiveness of this disease."
"I have witnessed the difficult fate endured by people and their families at the hands of this disease, which could not fail to touch even the hardest of hearts."
"I am grateful to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Security for putting a question on this topic to the Commission, which instigated this important debate."
"I thank all the authors of the resolution, including my Slovak colleague Irena Belohorská, for their efforts, without which we would have not found the answers to serious issues related to this aggressive disease."
"I am convinced that every step, even the smallest one, every investment that contributes to early cancer detection and diagnosis and supports new treatment will offer great hope to cancer patients."
"in writing. - With one in three Europeans diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime and one in four Europeans dying from the disease, cooperation to share best practice and to call for more resources for research is important in the EU."
"The concept of an interinstitutional EU Cancer Task Force with the aim to increase by 50% by 2018 the number of EU citizens participating in a cancer screening programme should be welcomed."
"in writing. - (IT) The Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, which laid the foundations for Europe's policy on climate, biodiversity, the environment, health and natural resources, has been very successful."
"However, as Commissioner Dimas himself mentioned, the EU has fallen a long way behind its schedule for reaching the environmental protection targets it originally set, especially on atmospheric pollution, with all the associated problems: the greenhouse effect, health impairment and acid rain."
"The cut in funding for Natura 2000 and the LIFE+ programme, moreover, is giving great cause for concern to small local authorities, which will suffer a corresponding reduction in their scope for action as regards effective environmental policies to protect their own area."
"I therefore cannot fail to fully agree with Mrs Myller, who, in this report calls on the Commission to include clearer, more specific quantitative and qualitative deadlines and targets in the text."
"Indeed, although the climate and energy package, the revision of the Waste Directive and the revision of the IPPC should help us to ensure a sustainable future for Europe, we have a pressing need and a responsibility to revise the Sixth Programme in order to fine-tune EU environmental action over the coming decades."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Myller report on the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, given the importance of achieving the objectives thus defined, particularly with regard to the thematic strategies, protection of biodiversity and enforcement of Community legislation, and not forgetting issues such as ecological taxation or the problem of environmentally harmful subsidies."
"Efforts should be redoubled in order to provide a timely response to the environmental problems targeted by the Programme."
"in writing. - (PT) This report stems from an assessment that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety requested in order to determine how well the European Union has so far honoured its commitments under the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme, which was approved in 2002 and runs until 2012."
"This assessment revealed that the implementation of the Action Programme is either very behind schedule or extremely behind schedule in the case of a number of priority objectives."
"In the light of the measures carried out so far, it does not seem that the priority environmental objectives of the Programme will be achieved by 2012."
"Accordingly, the assessment does not support the claim by the Commission in its own mid-term review that, on the whole, the EU is on schedule with the implementation of the measures planned in the Action Programme."
"According to the assessment commissioned by Parliament, it may be concluded that the Commission's decision to make specific proposals through the thematic strategies has not, on the whole, produced the desired result."
"However, despite having generally voted in favour of the report, we disagree with some of its points."
"in writing. - The mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme does not offer anything new, such as a change in the course already set."
"The review merely expresses concern that progress is not being made as quickly as envisaged in the timetables."
"Nevertheless, although the major environmental issues have been acknowledged, the review does not point out the reason for the worsening situation, i.e. the ruthless exploitation by multinationals for their own profit."
"They use the environment as a reservoir, which they plunder rashly for raw materials and exploit without control for the sake of profit."
"Indeed, the Sixth Environment Programme turns the very exploiters of nature into environmental protectors, as it expressly states that effective action, business opportunities and the market will provide a solution."
"In fact, the environment provides a new opportunity to accumulate capital and profit."
"This exploitation is even supported by Community resources - that is, citizens' money."
"The liberalisation of sectors of strategic importance and the commercialisation of environmental protection promote the green economy as one of the larger investment outlets for monopolistic capital."
"At the same time, increased awareness is being exploited worldwide."
"This conceals the fact that dangerous climate changes and global warming are the result of industrial development based on capitalist profit and the commercialisation of earth, air, energy, water, etc."
"in writing. - I welcome the Myller report on the mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme."
"I share its concerns over the increase in transport emissions and slow-moving efforts towards energy efficiency."
"More concerted effort needs to be made in these areas."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report by my Finnish colleague in the Socialist Group Riitta Myller."
"At the mid-term stage this text paints a worrying picture of the state of progress of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme (2002-2012)."
"The implementation of the vital measures to combat climate change is hugely delayed."
"Similarly, the EU has made extremely limited progress on the preservation of air quality, implementation and enforcement of Community legislation, protection of biodiversity, reform of environmentally harmful subsidies, and promotion of sustainable production/consumption models."
"The analysis provided in the report is alarming, to say the least, because at present, contrary to the Commission's statements, it seems highly unlikely that we will stick to the timetable set out six years ago and meet the priority environmental targets in 2012."
"By voting in favour of this text, I am joining with the majority of Parliament to urge the European Commission and the Member States to make a crucial final effort."
"in writing. - (SV) We voted for the amendment which calls upon the Commission and the Member States to refrain from blocking access to the Internet."
"However, we would point out that our support for the amendment is mainly concerned with the issue of file sharing for private use."
"For certain types of crime, for example child pornography offences and systematic infringements of copyright for commercial reasons, blocking access to the Internet should be one possible method along with others of combating criminal activity."
"in writing. - (FR) The report by Guy Bono on cultural industries in Europe reaffirms the importance of the cultural dimension in the implementation of the Lisbon objectives."
"It underlines the potential of cultural industries as regards employment and growth and the need to strengthen EU support and action in this sector."
"The report also highlights the opportunities offered today by the Internet in terms of accessing, promoting and disseminating culture."
"In this digital environment, it is nevertheless important to reconcile free access to the Internet and individuals' rights and freedoms."
"Internet use must comply with the major principles on which our democratic societies are built, including respect for intellectual property rights."
"To cope with the widespread and ongoing illegal downloads that affect the audiovisual and music sectors in particular, suitable and proportionate measures must be proposed in conjunction with the various stakeholders."
"Temporary suspension of Internet access, as part of a graduated response and with respect for individual freedoms, would be an appropriate solution that would also prevent the application of criminal sanctions, the limits of which are clear nowadays."
"I am sorry that Parliament rejected that possibility today."
"in writing. - (PT) We are well aware of the importance of culture and its dissemination in terms of cultural diversity and the rights of artists and people in every EU Member State."
"This report makes some positive suggestions which we support, such as the idea of promoting mobility for the people, goods and services in the creative sector, due regard for the rules and principles laid down in the UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity, and the call made to the Commission to look into the possibility of setting up a programme similar to the MEDIA programme."
"Likewise, we support the call made to the Commission to complete the procedures for implementing the initiative for the European digital library, to stimulate and support the music, theatre and publishing industries in order to facilitate the transnational distribution of works and, as a preliminary step, to set up a mechanism under the Culture Programme allowing non-audiovisual cultural industries to have access to Community funding to promote books, music and professional training."
"However, we do not agree with other proposals which aim to defend purely business interests rather than education, culture, artists' rights and the population in general."
"in writing. - (PL) The contribution that culture makes to economic growth and its impact on employment was confirmed as a result of research published by the European Commission at the end of 2006."
"This research showed that in 2003 the cultural sector contributed around 2.6% of the European Union's GDP and that more than 5 million individuals were working in the sector."
"Increased awareness of culture's economic dimension and of its role in job creation is gradually spreading."
"There is greater understanding, too, of culture's part in rural and urban development."
"In addition to its direct input into the economy, the creative and cultural sector has an indirect impact on the European socio-economic environment."
"It also promotes the development of ICT."
"Cultural industries play an important role at local, regional and urban level, and contribute significantly to competitiveness in the European Union."
"We should therefore welcome the fact that both the Council and the Commission intend to recognise the role of culture and creativity as key factors for rural development, promoting European citizenship and achieving the aims of the Lisbon Strategy."
"in writing. - (SV) Junilistan considers that cultural matters in general fall under the political responsibility of the Member States."
"We have therefore voted against this report in its entirety."
"The report falls outside the legislative procedure and is nothing more than an attempt by the Federalist majority in the European Parliament to give the EU even greater involvement in the field of cultural affairs."
"We have voted in favour of the amendment which opposes action to deny citizens access to the Internet since we are opposed to the proposal of France that it should be possible to exclude file sharers throughout the EU from the Internet."
"Basically, however, we consider that the question of file sharing is a matter for the Member States to legislate on."
"in writing. - Along with the majority of my group, I supported both parts of this amendment."
"Forced removal of a customer's Internet connection, without judicial oversight, is not the right solution to combating piracy."
"Furthermore, Internet connections are often not personal."
"Forcing the disconnection of one person's Internet connection would have an unintended and disproportionate impact on other innocent users of the same connection."
"I strongly support measures to protect those who work in the cultural industries by protecting intellectual property."
"However, access to the Internet is becoming increasingly important for civil participation, media pluralism, freedom of expression and interaction with government services."
"We should avoid disconnection wherever possible in favour of other, more effective measures to combat piracy."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Bono report which recognises the huge importance of cultural industries in Europe."
"In my own country, Scotland, the creative industries generate over £5 billion annually thereby contributing both to the economy and our society as a whole."
"The EU must work with the nations of Europe to ensure that we adopt a coherent strategy to promote the industries attached to our rich and culturally diverse continent."
"in writing. - (EL) The commercialisation of culture masquerades as supposed respect for diversity."
"The intellectual rights of creators are deemed to be property to be taken away and bought like a commodity."
"The need to respect the UNESCO conditions by means of purportedly dignified compromises is continuously and gradually adjusting to the WTO's requirements and terms."
"What is in fact taking place is a monopolistic centralisation and ownership of all the terms of cultural existence and cultural production of each country, under the umbrella of the measures and rules of the unpopular Lisbon strategy."
"This is designed to enrich capital; it hides behind fanciful blandishments, admonitions, exhortations and homilies about the respect for diversity."
"Unfortunately, all human values are used to fuel profit."
"The natural environment is being exploited for profit, and we are already experiencing the devastating effects of this policy."
"None other than the ruthless laws of the market are crushing, degrading and homogenising every cultural, aesthetic, artistic and moral value."
"These values have to be converted into capitalist profit, owing to internal and international imperialist competition."
"In EU policy, the internal contradiction between the quality of culture and of profit is resolved only if the ruthless needs for profit are answered."
"For this reason, we intend to vote against the report."
"in writing. - Mr Bono's report on the cultural industries in Europe calls for greater recognition of the industries' contribution to the European economy."
"The cultural sector should also be considered when formulating EU policy more generally."
"Policies affecting the internal market, competition, trade and research and development, among others, all concern the cultural sector in various ways, and the proposals found in the report recognise this."
"I therefore voted in support of Mr Bono's recommendations."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report tabled by my Socialist colleague Guy Bono on cultural industries in Europe."
"What are cultural industries?"
"The term may be unusual but although culture cannot be summed up as its economic dimension, it would be just as harmful to obscure this aspect of the matter: culture is now a powerful catalyst for growth and employment and in 2003 it accounted for 2.6% of GDP and 3.1% of jobs in the EU."
"This text recommends re-launching the European record industry (through a reduced rate of VAT or a European fund to support music) and tackles the issue of piracy, taking into account the need to make access to culture more democratic but also the need to respect intellectual property."
"In this respect, I supported in particular one amendment - adopted by a margin of 17 votes - contradicting the repressive strategy of a 'graduated response' proposed in France in the report presented by Denis Olivennes to the President of the Republic."
"In my view, it would be not only impracticable but dangerous to entrust service providers - private companies - with the role of monitoring and suspending the Internet connections of people suspected of illegal downloading."
"in writing. - (SV) The report on cultural industries in Europe opens with a frightening paragraph in the spirit of EU nationalism on the role of culture in the development of the European project."
"Despite this I am voting for the report since, in the most important parts, Parliament says that non-commercial file sharing should not be criminalised and, if Amendments 1 or 2 go through, there will be no recourse to such measures as blocking access to the Internet because they violate fundamental freedoms and human rights and are contrary to the principles of proportionate response, effectiveness and deterrent value."
"in writing. - (SV) In the European Parliament we have a name for reports which contain endless political wish lists, regardless whether we have powers in the field or not - they are called Christmas trees."
"Guy Bono's report is one of those."
"Yet there was an important bright spot in Christofer Fjellner's excellent Amendment 1, which stated a clear political position pointing out that attempts to deny Internet access to individuals who illegally copy material online should not be recommended."
"Since it has been leaked that President Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to transfer the French experiment to the EU, there is every reason to support a statement to the effect that this, to put it mildly, would not be appreciated."
"As the amendment was adopted, I voted in favour of a report which I would otherwise have tried to vote down."
"in writing. - On part 2 of Amendment 22, I believe that people that act illegally on the Internet should have that service withdrawn."
"This is why I voted against part 2."
"in writing. - (PT) I applaud the excellent report by my colleague Mr Graça Moura on a European agenda for culture in a globalising world, in which a vast programme is proposed to enable a strategy to be pursued both within the EU and in the EU's relations with third countries."
"Since at least March 2005, Mr Graça Moura has stressed that the Lisbon Strategy can never fully achieve its fundamental aims unless culture is treated as one of its essential dimensions."
"The Commission communication subscribes to this idea and makes culture a key point in the European political agenda."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he says that 'the fact that the world is globalising is what, to our mind, is implying an ever more pressing and urgent need to assert and strengthen the European identity, without detracting from the diversity of the cultures existing among the peoples of Europe'."
"I also congratulate the European Commission on this communication and I call for the task force for culture already announced by President Barroso to be set up, rather than delaying its creation and work."
"in writing. - (PT) This report contains some highly contradictory aspects."
"On the one hand, there is a constant attempt to hide the true situation in Europe."
"There is no single 'European cultural heritage', particularly as a reference for 'humanism, tolerance, democracy' and so on. The whole cultural history of Europe, just like its history in general, is not built solely on diversity, admirable creative energy and progress, but also on violent conflict, intolerance and many lines and contexts of cultural domination."
"A single heritage is a fiction, fed previously by cultural Eurocentrism (Europe as a 'vanguard' and other aspects mentioned) and fed nowadays by the oft-repeated myth of a 'European' cultural identity."
"On the other hand, however, the political intention to assert a European identity contains positive elements."
"This is because this assertion of identity is not just intended to assert a 'European' cultural identity, but to guarantee resistance to the pressure exerted by the dominant cultural industries of the US (defence of linguistic and cultural diversity; consideration of cultural industries as a 'protected space with regard to trade rules'; finding that the 'EU's trade balance in cultural goods and services is unfavourable')."
"We therefore abstained in the end."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the Graça Moura report which rightly highlighted the key role played by local, regional and national authorities in fostering and protecting cultural heritage."
"Europe's cultural diversity is one of our great treasures and my group, the European Free Alliance, is committed to safeguarding this diversity."
"Similarly, my party is committed to a culturally cosmopolitan Scotland and in government is taking steps to enhance Scotland's rich cultural tapestry, be that in our own linguistic diversity or our country's ability to take key decisions in relation to broadcasting."
"Europe can look forward to a culturally rich Scotland taking an independent place in the EU."
"in writing. - (PL) I supported the report on the European agenda for culture in a globalising world, as it emphasises that the Union's cultural policy focuses on European integration, whilst respecting the national and regional diversity of Member States."
"The Community may only act in the area of cultural policy when its resources supplement and support the actions of individual countries, but do not replace them."
"It is a matter of great satisfaction for me to be able to refer to the European Parliament's adoption of the amendment tabled by two Polish Members who are part of the Committee on Culture: Mrs Tomaszewska and Mr Podkański."
"Their amendment concerns declaring 2010 a year devoted to the memory of Frederic Chopin."
"It is worth recalling that 2010 will be the 200th anniversary of the birth of that gifted composer in Żelazowa Wola in Poland."
"in writing. - I welcome Mr Graça Moura's report as a step in the right direction for promoting and preserving Europe's cultural heritage."
"However, the call for schools to promote European identity, I feel, is contrary to the basic role of education in our society."
"Much more needs to be done, especially to ensure that this cultural heritage is shared as widely as possible."
"The report requires strengthening and my vote reflected this view."
"in writing. - (DE) Europe's cultural heritage is one of our great treasures which must be preserved."
"Thinking about how artists can be given not only financial but also legal support is one aspect of this, but it is also important to ensure that infringements which occur in the private sphere without any intention to make a profit are not penalised under criminal law."
"It is even more important, however, to ensure that our Christian-occidental roots are not gradually and irrevocably lost."
"The integration which we hear so much about must not consist of our dispensing with Christmas, Easter, St. Nicholas's day and so forth in our kindergartens and schools in an attempt to accommodate Muslim immigrants, for this would result in a loss of our cultural identity."
"Instead, we must do more to ensure that our customs, traditions and moral values are maintained, as well as respected by others."
"in writing. - (FR) I fully endorse this report, which recognises the fundamental role of culture in the process of European integration."
"I support the proposals for a cultural agenda for Europe with its three main objectives: promoting cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue, promoting culture as a vehicle for creativity within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy and promoting culture as a key element of the EU's external relations."
"The external dimension of culture in Europe should be asserted: culture should be incorporated into the political dialogue with our partner countries and regions and systematically integrated into the development programmes, notably with our ACP partners."
"I believe that the idea of creating an EU-ACP cultural fund is particularly judicious for it will encourage the emergence of local industries and markets and will facilitate the access of ACP cultural products to the European market."
"It is important to recognise the role played by local and regional authorities in promoting culture and to ensure that they are more involved in the implementation of the EU's cultural agenda."
"in writing. - (SV) The culture reports produced by Parliament are often difficult to deal with."
"The intention is of course good and, as the report in question points out, it is a good idea, when it can be justified, to make use of the pan-European level in order to support artists in the pursuit of their profession."
"That does not mean that everything should be done at EU level."
"On the contrary, there is good reason here to keep a close eye on the subsidiarity principle, so that Member States do not lose the option of developing their own cultural policies."
"It was therefore in part a question of principle which led to my decision to vote against the report."
"Even more serious in this precise instance, however, is the language used in much of the report."
"Recital K has a tone which is frightening."
"The same insinuation slips into several other parts of the text."
"It is important to proceed with care and discretion when discussing concepts such as cultural heritage."
"No such care was taken here."
"in writing. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party is in favour of education in schools about the history of the European Union."
"However, we do not agree that one particular view of European identity and culture should be actively promoted through school syllabuses."
"Therefore, we abstained on this vote, because education should be about informing students rather than promoting any one idea."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the Commission Green Paper on 'Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action' as I share the belief that adaptation measures constitute a guarantee against the negative and unavoidable effects of climate change."
"The prompt definition of adaptation measures for agricultural activity, water resource management, land-use planning and public health forms part of a desirable attitude towards defining Community-level environmental policies."
"in writing. - (PT) It is well known that, according to the contribution of Working Group II to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, nearly all European regions are expected to be negatively affected by future impacts of climate change."
"This may pose a further threat to European biodiversity and may interfere with social development, demanding a truly cross-cutting approach and the inclusion of social, economic and environmental aspects in the broad sense."
"This resolution highlights certain causes and measures which, in some cases, are contradictory."
"It is good that the existence of numerous studies and models at regional or local level on the likely impacts of climate change is recognised, but in many of these studies there is no equivalent consideration of the socio-economic dimension and the predictable consequences for the populations concerned."
"I welcome the invitation to the Commission to coordinate and support the scientific preparation of a common European database on vulnerabilities so as to understand how societal groups and the European cultural and national heritage would be affected and how societies could react to the consequences of climate change in the future."
"However, we disagree with other points, such as maintaining emissions trading."
"in writing. - I share the view Mr Sacconi outlines in the motion for a resolution on the Commission Green Paper on 'Adapting to Climate Change in Europe'."
"Efforts to adapt to climate change must be made as soon as possible."
"The international nature of the issue requires concerted European action. The financing of such actions should also reflect this."
"Climate change is happening and, while mitigation efforts are essential, they must be complemented by an EU strategy that allows us to adapt to the effects global warming will have on our everyday lives."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 17 April 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday:"
"No changes"
"Thursday:"
"The UEN Group has requested that in the debate on cases of breaches of human rights the item on Iran be replaced with a new item on Georgia."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I propose that we should discuss the situation in Georgia instead of Iran or Chad."
"The situation in Georgia is urgent, since the Russian Duma has adopted a resolution calling upon the President to consider the question of recognition for Transdniestria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and an increase in the numbers of Russian forces in the region."
"The territorial integrity of Georgia is guaranteed by 36 UN resolutions adopted in 1993."
"In addition there is President Saakashvili's peace plan for Abkhazia."
"I believe that this is a priority matter, which is why I am proposing this change."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I do think we should wait for this Parliament's delegation to visit Georgia in a week's time, when it will look in particular at the Abkhazia question."
"After all, a number of delegation members are present here."
"We can put this item on the agenda after the delegation's visit in a week's time, not perhaps as an item for urgent debate but certainly as a matter for serious discussion."
"First, however, we should wait for the report from the parliamentary delegation."
"(Parliament rejected the amendment)"
"(The order of business was adopted)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(ES) Mr President, as some of you will know from the media, a Spanish freezer vessel, the Playa de Bakio, based in Bermeo, carrying 26 crew aboard, 13 Spanish nationals and 13 crew of African origin, was seized yesterday when fishing for tuna in international waters 250 miles off the coast of Somalia."
"For some time now, the fisheries sector has been very concerned at the absence of security in that part of the Indian Ocean where piracy has become rife and where a French yacht was seized recently on 11 April."
"In view of this situation, Mr President, I would like to ask Parliament and the Community institutions as a whole to take whatever steps are necessary to expedite the immediate release of the crew and the vessel, and to protect the Community fleet fishing those waters, now considered to be the most dangerous in the world."
"Mr President, a few weeks ago, together with Mr von Wogau, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, I visited the EUBAM Mission in Odessa, Ukraine."
"Its mandate is to help Ukraine and Moldova manage their common border better, by providing both expertise and support."
"Once there, we could see that the Mission, through the quality and professionalism of its people, has managed to build a solid reputation of professional authority useful not only in passing on expertise to its counterparts, but also in mediating between them on important questions of mutual interest."
"Moreover, by flying the EU flag as the only embodiment of our Union in that large and important area, the EUBAM Mission is a very efficient ambassador for our institutions, thus contributing to the concrete implementation of both our security strategy and our neighbourhood policy there."
"It has most certainly set an example worthy of being applied in other areas of interest to us."
"Mr President, your speech at our recent part-session in Brussels on the events in Tibet was extremely well received by the House, and I think it enjoyed the support of all the Members present."
"It quite clearly reflected the public opinion in the European Union about the recent repression in Tibet."
"Considerable concern was also expressed by the Commission and by a number of Member States in Council."
"It is surprising, therefore - and to my group disappointing - that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has decided not to invite the Dalai Lama to come to Brussels to meet ministers."
"It therefore seems to me all the more important that this House pursue your suggestion that the Dalai Lama should come, and I wonder whether I might ask you to get in touch with the Dalai Lama's office to see whether he could advance the visit from the current schedule foreseen for December to an earlier date, since clearly the interest in this House and in Europe in discussing the events in Tibet before December is very great."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, I wish to speak on the same issue."
"The Olympic flame has been extinguished with the blood of the Tibetans, blood spilled in Tibet every day."
"The closer we get to the opening of the Olympics, the greater the Chinese reprisals against their own citizens and against the inhabitants of Tibet."
"At the last part-session in Brussels, we adopted a resolution criticising human rights violations by the Chinese authorities. We also called for the Chinese to resume negotiations with the Dalai Lama."
"Unfortunately these calls were ignored by the Slovenian Presidency."
"I think that Parliament should react decisively to the fact that the Dalai Lama has not been invited to any official meeting with the European Union by the Slovenian Foreign Minister, Dimitrij Rupel."
"Parliament is the conscience of Europe and this conscience must not be silenced by any pronouncements by any minister holding office in the European Union."
"(ES) Mr President, piracy has now become one of the worldwide threats to maritime safety."
"According to statistics compiled by the International Maritime Bureau, pirate attacks have tripled over the last decade: whereas there were 90 incidents of piracy in 1995, in 2007 the figure had risen to 263."
"As we speak, 26 crew members of the fishing vessel Playa de Bakio have been seized off Somalia and perhaps, as my fellow Member said earlier in this House, we should not only show solidarity with their families, but also request the European Union to take action in this matter and to make every effort to free these fishermen."
"It is not enough for us to sign agreements with various African States."
"We also have to ensure the safety of these vessels."
"The problem is European in scope and must be tackled as such."
"Mr President, as you are aware, there will be a referendum in Ireland on 12 June on the Lisbon Treaty."
"I want to raise with you a matter of very deep concern in Ireland."
"It has emerged through the media that the Commission, and committees of this Parliament, are actively colluding to suppress information."
"Let me quote Commission Vice-President Margot Wallström, that the Commission is willing to tone down or delay messages that might be unhelpful in advance of the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty; reports have been carried in the press of a letter that was sent to parliamentary committees urging them not to deal with sensitive political issues that might arise from Lisbon until the Treaty has been ratified."
"I want to say to you that these types of tactics are unacceptable."
"The Irish people should have their debate with full information."
"They deserve the full and unvarnished facts, whether in relation to corporation tax or the outworkings of the defence and security provisions of the Treaty."
"As a minimum - I am sure you will agree - the people deserve the full facts."
"So I call on you today to clarify publicly that committees will not delay or suppress debate on these sensitive matters, and I would equally urge the Commission to do likewise."
"(EL) Mr President, I apologise for the delay, but I have just arrived in Parliament."
"I believe that it would be unrealistic for anyone to talk about cross-border cooperation in the case of Greece, which is the country that receives the fourth highest number of illegal immigrants, after Spain, France and Sweden."
"Now what talk can there be of cross-border cooperation when, on the other hand - is this not the case, Mr President? - we have to deal with a country engaged in just that: Turkey, which is doing that job; in other words, Turkey has men who are professionally engaged in transporting illegal immigrants from Asia to Europe."
"In addition, the financial assistance received by Greece is minimal - I am sorry that I do not have enough time to go into the relevant details - and I must tell you that if Europe does not help, I believe that it is Europe that will have to foot the bill for the people who today are pouring into Europe, via Greece and the Aegean sea, with its 2 000 islands."
"(BG) I take the floor in order to draw your attention to a canker affecting the rights of over a million citizens in Bulgaria's capital city."
"This is a problem which illustrates clearly the corruption schemes which, regrettably, have crept into all areas of life in Bulgaria over the past several years."
"For eight years in a row now, with the obvious blessing of both the town hall and the government, the Sofiyska Voda company has been amassing huge profits at the expense of ordinary citizens without delivering even at a minimum level on its obligations undertaken under the concession agreement. Instead of having the agreement terminated, however, the concession holder receives additional loans amounting to millions of euro."
"The government authorities in Bulgaria, both central and municipal, keep turning a blind eye to the numerous protests by citizens' groups which have finally had to approach Mr. Barroso, the European Commission representative, both through official and unofficial channels during his recent visit to our country."
"Since Bulgaria and its institutions do not have the will to protect the rights of the civil society, I trust that the authorities of the European Union will do so."
"(RO) In April, for the first time Bucharest was present on all media channels only in a favourable light, on the occasion of the NATO Summit that took place in Romania."
"Many did not think that our country could organize a summit of this size: 3,000 officials from 49 countries and 3,500 journalists, since the Bucharest Summit had the greatest participation and the most complex agenda in NATO's history."
"I would like to point out three major Summit conclusions: Croatia and Albania were invited to join NATO;"
"NATO will install an anti-missile shield complementary to the American one - this shield will protect NATO countries that are not covered by the American shield; the NATO leaders undertook to increase their troops in Afghanistan in order to fight the Taliban, to share the difficulties of military operations and limit restrictions in using their troops."
"(EL) Mr President, let us pay tribute to the memory of Nikos Aslamazidis, of the Saint-Nazaire dockyard, who went on hunger strike."
"We must once again raise the issue of protecting workers from modern-day slave trading."
"Let us talk about unemployment, under-employment, and job insecurity, and also about agencies which hire out workers, or, perhaps I should say, exploit them."
"These employment agencies treat workers like modern-day slaves: they use them until they are worn out, pay them peanuts, move them around at will and arbitrarily get rid of them."
"How are we protecting the workers?"
"The Bolkestein Directive makes ambiguity an art form and allows them to be thrown onto the social slag heap."
"The increasingly popular flexicurity policy is a new way of deregulating employment relations resulting in less stable employment and greater insecurity job."
"As a result, we now have disposable workers, who struggle daily to survive with dignity."
"The creation of different kind of Europe whose priorities are full employment, improved working conditions and a fairer redistribution of wealth, is not only feasible but imperative."
"The sacrifices of the workers are essentially a struggle against the new imposition of medieval terms of employment against which all progressive forces must really fight as one."
"(RO) Deforestation has reached an alarming rate at a global level, namely 13 million hectares a year."
"The phenomenon is closely related to the illegal cutting of trees and illicit trade in wood products."
"We could continue to shut our eyes to the massacre of the forests, believing that we, Europeans, have advanced systems of biodiversity and consumer protection."
"In EU, approximately 50 per cent of wood imports from tropical countries and 20% of wood imports from Europe and the Russian Federation come from illegal sources."
"Therefore, we contribute fully to illegal deforestations in the Amazon and what's more, the phenomenon is also widespread in EU Member States such as Estonia, Romania and Bulgaria."
"We need to have a consistent and honest approach toward the issue of illegal deforestation and illicit trade in third countries, but particularly on European Union territory."
"Therefore, I request the European Commission to submit as soon as possible a legislative proposal by which only wood and wood products coming from legal sources could be traded on the European market."
"For this purpose, I have launched a written statement in the EP and I encourage my colleagues to join us in the fight against illegal deforestation."
"(EL) Mr President, the increase in prices and the impending food shortages are assuming worrying dimensions."
"I draw your attention to justifiable concerns over recent developments during the agricultural negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."
"The European Commission is conducting the negotiations. It must act strictly within the negotiating mandate of the Council and within the framework of the revised common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"The Commission must ensure the viability, competitiveness and multifunctional nature of European agriculture."
"The need for a quality food supply to Europe now appears pressing; it must guide the negotiating position of the EU."
"(ES) Mr President, on Wednesday 23 April UNESCO is celebrating World Book Day."
"That is also the day on which Miguel de Cervantes died and William Shakespeare was born."
"Miguel de Cervantes, the greatest figure in Spanish literature, is universally known for his Don Quixote; it is generally agreed that this book is the first modern novel and one of the finest works of literature in the world."
"The English playwright, poet and actor William Shakespeare was born on a different 23 April, according to the Julian calendar, and is regarded as the most important writer in the English language and also one of the giants of world literature."
"This is the day chosen by many countries of the European Union as the feast day of their patron saint."
"This is the case in Catalonia, where it is traditionally the feast day of San Jordi, St George, a day for celebrating the Catalan language and culture."
"I think it would be recognition of European cultures and literature for this Parliament to agree to join in these celebrations on a cultural and literary day which is so widely celebrated in the European Union."
"(CS) Mr President, allow me to point out that our decisions sometimes lead to quite unexpected results."
"Today the enthusiasm for biofuels and their use in the fuel mix is subsiding somewhat."
"Not only are biofuels driving up the price of agricultural commodities; they are also contributing to faster devastation of the rainforests."
"We should learn a lesson from this for future legislation."
"Some of our other laws may have similar adverse effects, such as the recent trend towards voluntary regulation of the automobile industry."
"We must not therefore be too hasty to legislate and we must take time to consider the laws and adopt a more responsible approach."
"We would do well to remember the old adage 'look before you leap'."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to say a few more words about freedom of expression in Russia."
"The Moskovsky Korrespondent daily newspaper has disappeared from news stands because it showed an interest in Vladimir Putin's supposed divorce."
"What takes place in the full glare of publicity in France is covered with secrecy in Russia."
"Clearly any information concerning the marital status of a Head of State should be in the public domain. Moreover, people are not even allowed to ask questions about such matters, as was shown by the recent attack by Vladimir Putin on a female journalist from Niezavisima Gazieta, which reduced the woman to tears."
"The rules governing standards of behaviour in the relationship between the authorities and the media recognised in the civilised world still do not apply in Russia."
"There, the media are a tool controlled by the authorities and if they do not conduct themselves in accordance with the authorities' wishes they are closed down."
"Journalists are intimidated, and in extreme cases physically liquidated, as was the case with Anna Politkovskaja."
"Freedom of expression is the foundation of democracy."
"Once again we can see that the foundations of Russian democracy are very weak."
"(HU) Mr President, in recent years Hungarians have been beaten up in the streets of Slovakia, Serbia and Romania, simply because they have been speaking in their native language - Hungarian."
"This very weekend aggression has been renewed and blood spilt in Kolozsvár, in Transylvania."
"The victims were journalists, Tibor Zágy, István Ambrus and János Fancsali, who were attacked from behind on the street at night by three young Romanians and brutally beaten."
"They were jeered at and insulted, called filthy foreigners and told to go back home where they belonged."
"In a similar incident on Saturday, another Hungarian, Mr Attila, was knifed in the main square in Szabadka/Subotica, in the Vojvodina in Serbia."
"This is the place where, on 15 March 2008 - Hungarian Revolution Day - there was an anti-Hungarian demonstration, organised by a neo-fascist Romanian group, the New Right, in Kolozsvár, where, the same day, a young Hungarian was assaulted."
"It is a matter of urgency that we join forces with our Romanian cousins to suppress aggressive nationalism."
"We look forward to legislation being adopted by the Romanian authorities and the culprits being punished in an exemplary fashion."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to mention a serious issue: the constant attempts to revise the history of World War II."
"These are repeated attempts, which take different forms and which sometimes take place in the European Parliament."
"Most often, in fact in the overwhelming majority of cases, they manifest themselves as attacks on the Czech, or rather Czechoslovakian, so-called Presidential Decrees."
"In the former Czechoslovakia, these Decrees, based on international law, were used to regulate legal issues relating to the defeat of Nazi Germany."
"I know for a fact that some German and Hungarian Members of the European Parliament are planning further action this year in opposition to these Presidential Decrees."
"Consequently, I would ask the Members of the European Parliament not to support such activities and to strongly condemn them."
"I am sure that we agree that any revision of the history of World War II is entirely unacceptable."
"- (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me call your attention to the fact that from today Written Declaration No 33 is open for signature."
"It concerns where young people stand in the EU's policies."
"Everyone knows that young people are affected by unemployment."
"This is what we must focus on for both the present and the future of the EU."
"We therefore call on the Member States to take young people into account in all relevant policy sectors."
"They must enter with them into a structured dialogue. They must plan policies in education and life-long learning; and also employment, social inclusion, health, the independence of young people, mobility, fundamental rights and non-discrimination."
"This will give us hope for better prospects in the matter of young people, who are difficult to find, owing to the problem of demographics."
"(FI) Mr President, one in three fatal road accidents in Europe is caused by drunk driving."
"On the sunny shores of Spain last Saturday evening at least nine Finnish tourists lost their lives and 19 were seriously injured when a drunken driver with one per mil alcohol in his system crashed his sport utility vehicle into the bus which was carrying them."
"The accident was made even more serious by the fact that several passengers were not wearing the safety belts fitted in the bus."
"There should be some serious thought given at European Union level to how these sorts of appalling incidents and such completely unnecessary loss of life can be avoided in the future."
"At present the per mil limits vary in the EU between zero and 0.8."
"They should be made uniform and as close as possible to zero throughout all the EU countries."
"Furthermore, there needs to be compliance with the rules on safety belts and drivers should be made sufficiently aware of these."
"We also need to take sufficient account of the consequences of people ignoring them."
"Thank you, Mrs Myller."
"We all offer our deep sympathy to the victims' families."
"(BG) European citizens are concerned about the rise in food prices."
"The overall jump in prices which is felt in Western Europe is more painful in Eastern Europe because of low income levels."
"A new leap in prices in expected, as a result of financial markets instability and the anticipation of a global economic crisis."
"The International Monetary Fund called for decisive action to control food prices."
"The general rise in prices is linked to energy costs, and the European Union is energy-dependent."
"Hence, discussions on food prices ought to address not only rational farmland use and exploring alternative energy sources."
"In addition, soaring food prices can be placed under control by regulating prices of traditional energy sources."
"This demands, once again, a reconsideration of the use of nuclear power as part of the EU energy mix."
"If nuclear power facilities which are available in Member States are switched on at full capacity, the shortage of energy could be overcome and this would influence prices of goods in the consumer basket."
"(PL) Mr President, the Polish Parliament was one of the first legislatures to consider the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and passed a bill giving its consent for the President of Polish Republic to sign the instrument of ratification."
"Many EU Member States have not yet taken any decision on this question."
"The Constitutional Treaty was blocked following the vote taken by the citizens of France and the Netherlands."
"I do not propose to refer to the substance of the two treaties."
"We are all entitled to our own opinion on this."
"I want to draw attention to the fact that here in the Chamber, and elsewhere, critical remarks have been made about Poland and the ratification process by representatives of countries which have made no progress at all on this up to now."
"I regard those remarks as unjustified and ill-intentioned."
"(DE) Mr President, according to Amnesty International's annual report, more than one third of all death sentences worldwide are carried out in China."
"The exact number is probably much higher and therefore a state secret."
"Sixty-two states apply the death penalty, sometimes for non-violent crimes such as adultery, tax evasion, prostitution or homosexuality."
"Iran, Saudi Arabia and Yemen also execute young people under the age of 18."
"The European Union must therefore do all in its power to uphold the elementary human right to life and seek a worldwide moratorium on the death penalty."
"It should address China in particular, heading up these sad statistics, in an endeavour to bring it closer to applying these universal human rights, in accordance with the Olympic motto 'One World, One Dream'."
"(PT) Mr President, the Portuguese company Cerâmica Torriense has taken disciplinary action against Pedro Jorge, a worker and trade union leader at the company, with a view to his dismissal, after he participated in a Portuguese radio-television programme where all he did was tell the truth."
"In this television programme, he used himself as an example of the situation in which workers in many companies find themselves, that is, they have had no pay rise since 2003."
"We would like to demonstrate our solidarity with workers and trade unionists who are the targets of repression."
"We think that the company's behaviour is unacceptable."
"Its persecution and intimidation of this worker and active trade unionist is contrary to democracy and freedom and deserves our strongest condemnation."
"Mr President, last Monday the Commission launched its task force report on Northern Ireland by Commissioner Hübner, and I am very pleased to see her in the Chamber here this evening, so she can at last hear what I have to say on this subject."
"Unfortunately, though this report contains some good points, it did not go far enough to cover this destructural deficit we experienced by lagging so far behind the rest of Europe after over 30 years of terrorist violence."
"It is also most unfortunate that the Members of this Parliament were not properly consulted or kept informed; this has never happened before - a major opportunity has been missed by the Commission and the First and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland, and not one extra euro has been given."
"Unfortunately, this has now been seen as a long exercise that did not in the end give any real positive result."
"Mr President, the peace in Northern Ireland is still fragile."
"It has come a long way, and it has taken a long time."
"But it is still fragile, and the difficulties that still lie ahead should not be underestimated."
"I believe more can be done, more could have been done and more should be done to ensure we provide a very strong base to this peace process that many of us have worked so hard to achieve over such a long period of time."
"(HU) Mr President, on 11 May Serbia will go to the polls."
"We all know that the Western Balkans will not be stable unless there is stability in Serbia."
"However, all the indications are exceptionally negative."
"There is Kosovo, with the loss of 16% of the country's territory."
"Nationalism casts a shadow over everything and it is conceivable that the nationalists, the Radical Party, Koštunica and the Socialist Party, and Milošević's party will form a coalition."
"Serbia is not moving towards Europe."
"At the same time, the European Union is making every mistake it could make."
"I pray that Javier Solana will not make a statement, as with every one of his statements Javier Solana damages the prospects for Tadić's pro-European party."
"It was a huge mistake to allow Haradinaj, the Albanian guerrilla, to leave The Hague."
"It was a huge mistake to announce a trade agreement with Kosovo at this point in time."
"It was a huge mistake to keep talking about the Stabilisation and Association Agreements (SAA) (which The Netherlands thwarted in January) and saying that the European Union is doing good, that it is helping, that it is making visas easier, and trying to retrieve the irretrievable, the Union is attempting at last to help the democrats, the pro-Europe parties. Thank you."
"Mr President, the protests that disrupted the Olympic torch relay in Europe have backfired on us, as there are now several anti-Western demonstrations going on in China."
"In principle, everyone has a right to feel betrayed that the Chinese authorities have not fulfilled their commitment to improving the human rights situation in that country, and the ongoing violence in Tibet continues to cast a shadow over the Olympics in Beijing."
"However, I cannot go along with the idea that aggressive protests such as those that took place in London and Paris addressed this issue in a proper manner."
"Our inclination to take advantage of the Olympics to introduce some democratic values for the people of China is going to be met with extreme reluctance, as they feel insulted by those protests."
"An internal change inspired by the will of the Chinese people is needed to bring about the fall of the Communist regime in China."
"Anti-Western demonstrations are quite vivid proof that our recent acts have led to the opposite of what we had hoped for."
"(EL) Mr President, according to the European Commission's data, in order to protect fisheries stocks, we are reducing the Community fleet annually by 2%."
"Thus from 2003 to 2006 the reduction is of the order of 10%."
"Despite this, the reduction in the fleet does not correspond to smaller catches, because of the improvement in fishing technology."
"On the other hand, while the EU is reducing its fishing fleet, countries in Africa and the Pacific, such as Australia, New Zealand and China, are building more and more boats and increasing their fishing fleets."
"The Community fleet is thus shrinking, while at the same time the fleets of third countries are growing."
"This means that we are not achieving anything!"
"Although it imports 40% of the fish it consumes, the EU is sufficiently aware to make an effort."
"It is therefore vital for us to include this subject in international talks."
"We must ensure that others also reduce their fishing fleets."
"(RO) In order to best use the opportunities provided by globalization, the European Union should modernize its social policies and invest mainly in human resources."
"Starting in the '90s, expenses of social protection have remained around 28% of the gross domestic product."
"During 2000-2007, the number of jobs increased by 13 million, while the unemployment rate decreased from 9% to 7%."
"At the same time, approximately 80 million European citizens are below the poverty threshold."
"The poverty risk among children is 19% in the European Union."
"The Lisbon Treaty emphasizes the importance for the European Union to have a social market economy."
"Social changes that take place in the context of globalization refer to unemployment, the reform of the pension system, the reform of taxation systems, fighting poverty and invetsments in education and the child care system."
"Education could play a vital role in compensating for the socio-economic disadvantage and for opening the way for children's succesful development."
"Member States should also improve their health systems and fight poverty among the elderly as well."
"(FR) Mr President, I just wanted to remind Members that on Wednesday we will be celebrating the first World Malaria Day."
"Until now it was called Africa Malaria Day. This year, for the first time, it will be commemorated as World Malaria Day."
"I wanted to remind Members that this global problem, which, by its nature, is associated with poverty, affects 107 countries in the world, and that in 90 of those countries it constitutes a major public health problem, since 40% of the world's population lives in malaria-stricken regions."
"The number of reported malaria cases worldwide is somewhere in the region of 350 to 500 million per year, with more than 60% of cases being reported in Africa, leading to 90% of malaria deaths."
"Every 30 seconds a child dies in Africa from malaria."
"This means that, by the end of my speech, Mr President, two children will have died from malaria."
"The disease is also believed to inhibit growth, as malaria reduces GDP by USD 12 billion per year."
"On Wednesday, a working lunch will be held on the subject at 1 p.m. in Room C 2.1."
"(RO) In relation to the report on volunteering, I would like to emphasize the importance of these actions in the countries newly integrated into the European Union, namely the role of volunteering for improving the economic situation and social cohesion."
"Romania, as well as other countries in the European areas, has taken shy actions in the field of promoting volunteering, although the European policies on recycling waste, reducing carbon emissions and environmental protection could be implemented and motivated by the involvement of politicians, together with young people, in volunteer actions."
"The impact is so strong that it could trigger a favourable reaction of the state institutions and contribute to changing the mentality of a generation."
"I propose the inclusion of volunteering into the education system and interregional programmes based on projects for establishing connections between Member State citizens."
"I propose criteria of symbolic stimulation for people participating in volunteer actions and I request the help of the European Commission and the European Parliament."
"(SK) The European Foundation for Democracy was launched in Brussels last week."
"I welcome the creation of this pan-European initiative, whose fundamental task is to promote freedom and democracy beyond the European Union's borders and to support the opposition in countries that are not free."
"Many of us spent part of our lives under totalitarian regimes."
"I believe that today, now that are free, we have to help those courageous women and men who strive for freedom and democracy in their countries."
"I have personal experience of giving financial support to the families of Cuban dissidents."
"I also believe that we need to find ways of supporting the activities of the European Foundation for Democracy from the European Union budget."
"In this way we can join the struggle to promote freedom and stand alongside figures such as Václav Havel, Richard von Weizsäcker, Jacques Delors and other politicians who have agreed to become patrons of this Foundation."
"(EL) Mr President, the Council has decided to wage a war of nerves with the UN by dealing with the situation in Kosovo through unilateral initiatives irrespective of the rule of law or international law."
"Thus the decision to send the EULEX peace-keeping force to Kosovo to take over the role that until recently had been played by UNMIK is a tactical error."
"In Article 5 the Council decision notes that there will be a transfer of mission from the UN to the EU force once the formers mission has ended."
"Fortunately, there are countries, such as Spain, which oppose such initiatives."
"According to Mr Moratinos, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, the initiatives contravene international law."
"Finally, Slovenia and France warned Serbia that it had to accept EULEX, or else risk not joining the EU."
"I consider this to be unacceptable, to say the least."
"(SK) The blank front pages of Slovakia's daily papers - a protest against the approval of the media law that will introduce non-democratic press standards in Slovakia from June 2008 - remind me of Belarus, where the government does not respect the opposition and where there is no freedom of speech or freedom of the press."
"I believe that a Member State that is celebrating on 1 May 2008 the fourth anniversary of its accession to the European Union should not adopt laws that are contradict the basic democratic principles of the European Union."
"Mr Pöttering, I greatly appreciate your words and your clear stance in favour of press freedom in Slovakia."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues Mr Joseph Daul and Mr Michael Gahler for their support."
"I trust that the representatives of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will not adopt a passive approach to this matter either."
"I also appeal to all European politicians of a democratic persuasion to make every effort to ensure that the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought is not awarded to Slovakia."
"Mr President, I should like to say a few words about the position of agriculture in the current WTO negotiations."
"I am deeply concerned about the direction being taken by Commissioner Mandelson in the negotiations with regard to concessions on agriculture."
"On a number of occasions, I have put the question to Commissioner Fischer Boel in this House, and each time she has reassured me that Commissioner Mandelson is staying within his remit."
"However, with the ministerial meeting scheduled for 20 May in Geneva, and Commissioner Mandelson's willingness to sacrifice agriculture to get a deal - with, I might add, nothing in return on non-agricultural market access and services - I am very concerned."
"At our last part-session in Strasbourg we discussed the CAP, and many Members spoke of the need for food security and on the issue of air miles on food products and the growing of food for fuel."
"All of this will have serious implications for European food supply."
"If Commissioner Mandelson gets his way and reduces import tariffs beyond what he was mandated to do, he will flood the European markets with imported food."
"The outcome of his actions will be to severely damage and, in some cases, destroy European food production."
"We can only do this once and then it is done permanently."
"As parliamentarians, we have a responsibility to ensure not just sustainable quality and traceable food, but also food security."
"(SK) I would like to point out that Cardinal Alfonso López Trujillo, President of the Pontifical Council for the Family, died in Rome yesterday at the age of 72 ."
"Throughout his life he promoted traditional family values and opposed abortion."
"As the head of the influential Latin American Bishops Conference, he was considered a possible papal candidate after the death of John Paul II in 2005."
"In 2006 he criticised scientists involved in embryonic stem cell research. In his view, the destruction of embryos was comparable to abortion."
"Cardinal Trujillo always responded to today's world events in a clear and timely manner."
"I had several meetings with him, which demonstrated how we, as Christian politicians, could benefit from his opinions."
"We will miss his voice. May he rest in peace."
"Mr President, freedom of the press is a fundamental principle of democracy and we rightly expect the Turkish penal code to be amended so as to respect this principle."
"However, in order to be persuasive, we have to make sure that this principle is properly applied in the EU Member States too."
"I would ask colleagues to consider, objectively, whether the press in Europe is really democratic and free."
"The answer is 'not really'."
"The press in the EU is to a large extent manipulated and directed by non-journalistic economic and political interests."
"The media, in many cases, present the truth not as it really is, but as certain media barons wish the public to perceive it as being."
"The time has come for us to look critically at how the press functions in the EU and take urgent corrective action."
"We should be firm with Turkey on freedom of the press, but at the same time we should take action in our own countries against press corruption."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, trade and cooperation help to bring countries and individuals closer together, as does sport."
"In 2008 we have an anniversary that is particularly important for European countries: it is the 100th anniversary of the International Ice Hockey Federation."
"To commemorate this event, a group of Members from European hockey-playing countries, led by the Slovak Member of the European Parliament, Mr Peter Šťastný, organised an exhibition in the European Parliament in Brussels, reminding us of both the successes as well as the difficult times when athletes were oppressed in some countries under the communist regime."
"Thanks to Mr Šťastný's contacts, the Stanley Cup was brought over from Canada especially for this occasion and was put on display, for the first time, in Belgium and in the European Parliament."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my thanks to you, Mr President, and to Commissioner Mr Ján Figeľ, for launching and sponsoring the exhibition, whose motto is 'Uniting people through the passion for a sport', and of course to all those who visited this exhibition and will pass the message on to others."
"Thank you."
"It was an impressive event."
"I would be interested to know whether you are aware of any media reports."
"That brings us to the end of the list of speakers."
"All those who asked to speak, in writing or by raising their hand, have taken the floor."
"(EL) Mr President, this is the third time I have taken part in the one-minute speech procedure."
"I am asking the Presidency for permission to speak, but you are not giving it to me."
"Why do you not let me have my say?"
"Mr Toussas, I have just heard that you may have asked to speak."
"Normally, Members put requests to speak in writing to ensure that they appear on the list."
"You are not entered in my list. But I will give you the floor as the last speaker."
"I would ask you to put your request in writing next time. Then you will not be overlooked if there is any speaking time left."
"(EL) Mr President, for some days now, economic migrants employed on farms have been suffering in appalling working and living conditions."
"Employed in the strawberry fields of Nea Manolada, in the Prefecture of Ilia, Greece, they have been on strike, asking for their daily wage to be increased from the humiliating amount of EUR 23 to EUR 30."
"Large-scale strawberry growers and their hired thugs attempted to intimidate the foreign workers. In an attempt to forestall a large rally planned by the workers for yesterday in the square of Pyrgos, Ilia Prefecture, the workers' camps were attacked, shots were fired in the air, and many workers were savagely beaten."
"We condemn this barbaric attack, to which the police and the legal authorities turned a blind eye."
"We ask for measures to be taken immediately to protect economic migrants."
"That concludes this item."
"Commission: budgetary framework and priorities for 2009 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jutta Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the 2009 budget, Section III - Commission: budgetary framework and priorities for 2009."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Hübner, ladies and gentlemen, this year's budgetary procedure is special because it is the last one to obey the rules that have applied in the past."
"As of next year we will be establishing our budget according to the procedure set out in the Lisbon Treaty."
"That means our Parliament will have to concentrate more carefully because we will have to express our political will in budgetary items and budgetary figures at a single reading."
"We will no longer be able to rectify, to amend compromises we have reached, or to make up for mistakes at a second reading."
"The first and indeed only reading must remain and must serve as a workable basis for negotiations with the Council up to the end of the year."
"It is therefore important for us to emphasise that alongside the 2009 budgetary procedure we expect to make preparations together with the Council and the Commission to ensure that we conduct the budgetary procedure in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty."
"Our current budgetary procedure is, however, somewhat different already."
"At the suggestion of the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, the Committee on Budgets has decided it will no longer submit our usual guidelines in response to the Commission's Annual Policy Strategy in the form of an initial motion for a resolution in plenary, but will instead present our proposal on the budgetary framework and priorities for 2009."
"The groups are responsible for the APS resolution, which will address all the policy areas."
"We in the Committee on Budgets have concentrated on the overarching budgetary concerns we consider especially important and have set them out in 11 paragraphs."
"I want to draw particular attention to three aspects."
"Firstly, it is clear that our budgetary cloth has been cut very closely, i.e. it is a very tight fit."
"The margins for the individual headings are very small."
"We cannot fund political priorities that would urgently need budgetary flanking measures, such as playing a practical role in climate policy, without putting earlier priorities at risk."
"The same applies to funding growth and employment or a sustainable Europe."
"If we take, for example, Heading 1A we see that we can under no circumstances finance any new agencies with available funds."
"We will have to stick to our old, but simple and eminently reasonable principle of 'new tasks, new money'."
"Secondly, it is clear see that Heading 4 is chronically under-funded."
"The picture there remains the same year after year."
"We expect the Commission to present us with a preliminary draft budget that has analysed the requirements precisely and is realistic."
"We want at last to use the flexibility instrument for the purpose for which it was introduced, namely for unforeseen needs."
"We do not want it to have been swallowed up, in part or even in full, by the end of the year."
"Thirdly, we are firmly resolved to inform the Commission before Parliament's summer recess of our intentions regarding pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"We expect the Commission to leave us adequate margin for manoeuvre for this parliamentary instrument in the preliminary draft budget, and to do so for all headings."
"We certainly noticed that it has not included the pilot projects and preparatory actions in the tables attached to the Annual Policy Strategy for 2009."
"In conclusion, we are resolved not to go beyond the financial framework but are very clearly aware of the restrictions and problems and therefore hope for good cooperation with the Council and the Commission."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to start by informing Ms Haug and the other Members of this House that the Commission has not only examined this resolution, but can also agree with a significant number of points, not least in respect of the principles of budgetary discipline and sound financial management."
"We appreciate this opportunity to hold an exchange of views at an early stage in the 2009 annual budget procedure."
"In that spirit I also fully share the view expressed in your draft resolution that we should start reflecting on the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty on the budget procedure."
"The Commission has also taken note of Parliament's continued support for activity-based budgeting and its proposal to come forward with ideas for pilot projects and preparatory actions before the summer."
"This will no doubt improve the possibility of a smooth and timely implementation."
"The Commission also appreciates Parliament's detailed examination of the 2009 APS, which was the subject of an intensive debate last March."
"The APS serves as a consistent reference framework for preparation of the preliminary draft budget and the Commission's legislative and work programme, although it does not predetermine the final outcome, which will take account of the European Parliament and Council priorities."
"It is on this basis that the Commission will adopt the preliminary draft budget for 2009."
"In terms of policy development and programming implementation, 2009 is the third year of the current programming period and should be a year of consolidation."
"Accordingly, the Commission has not proposed, in the APS, any major changes in financial programming."
"It has, however, proposed three main initiatives with a limited impact on the allocation of financial resources in 2009."
"Firstly, as part of our policy on the integrated management of the external borders, there is a reinforcement of Frontex in the budget, as already decided, in 2008, by the budget authority."
"Secondly, to follow up the EU's new strategy on Central Asia adopted by the Council in June 2007, the Commission is proposing to frontload assistance to that area in 2009, while keeping the total allocation over the period the same."
"Thirdly, in line with the Bali road map, it has proposed reinforcing support for the environment and the sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries."
"In making these proposals, the Commission has taken care to carefully limit the impact on the available margins, and will continue to do so when presenting its PDB."
"I shall conclude by stressing an important point."
"During the course of the 2008 budget procedure, a number of joint declarations were agreed with regard to agencies, both executive and centralised, and the detailed information that should be available to the budget authority."
"The Commission will implement those provisions during the 2009 budget procedure, and I am confident this will afford Parliament a clearer picture of the resources available."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (HU) Thank you for giving me the floor, Mr President."
"I am sure that Jutta Haug's report will get the support of Parliament and I congratulate her on her work."
"I would like now to express a few thoughts."
"The first is that Parliament is trying, with its hands tied, to work out a budget to meet the new challenges."
"We have heard about those just now."
"We support the enhanced role for growth and job creation, since this will be one of the key elements in the development of underdeveloped regions, or it should be."
"I am delighted that the Commission has this safe pair of hands as its representative, with responsibility for regional development."
"A very important point in this report is that European citizens must be informed about how their money is being spent and how we are committed to spending their money to get as much value as possible."
"We are waiting for the Lisbon Treaty to be ratified and so cannot behave as we would hope to at the end of the year, when all of a sudden, to coin a phrase, just like the rabbit being pulled out of the hat, the agreement which will regulate our work will magically appear."
"We have to work towards that."
"The European People's Party is voting for this report and hopes the amended motions will be supported, especially those concerning small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I am not in full agreement, however, with Mrs Haug that we are negotiating in time."
"The previous budget will have to be in place, and we can agree it only if by some happy chance we have requested in advance items which the Commission also supports."
"We will have to properly think through how we do that in the future so that Parliament can send its own message sooner to the Commission. Thank you for your kind attention."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (SV) Mr President, as Mrs Haug said, this is the last budget to follow the old model, at least if the new treaty is ratified, but it is also a budget which is a prelude to longer-term budgetary reform."
"At the same time, we are, of course, heading towards the mid-term review."
"This being the case, it is natural for us to view budgetary issues from a longer-term perspective."
"We consider, and it is important in the resolution, that important new political priorities must also be borne out in the budget."
"For example, at the moment we clearly have insufficient funds under heading 1, sustainable growth, etc. and under heading 4."
"We therefore expect a courageous proposal from the Commission for the mid-term review, but we must also start as early as next year's budget."
"We have some points to raise which are particularly important."
"Firstly, I am thinking about climate and energy policy."
"I am budget rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and we have, for example, the major Strategic Energy Technology Plan, the SET plan, we have the measures for energy efficiency and so on, all of which have insufficient budgetary resources."
"The second point I am considering is heading 4, particularly everything that is happening in the Balkans."
"Last year we had a major debate on investment in Kosovo."
"This investment must continue and it must be long term."
"Furthermore, it must take place at the same time as finding additional support to help Serbia and Bosnia draw closer to the EU."
"The third thing we would like to focus on is the quality of the budget."
"We have sometimes had rather too many pilot projects and preparatory actions, for example."
"Now we should focus more on ensuring that these kinds of measures really are implemented successfully."
"One of the things I am thinking of here is what I myself have proposed regarding preserving the cultural heritage of the war-torn Balkans."
"We must now ensure that this really does become a permanent investment."
"The fourth area I am thinking about is the food crisis."
"We are now in a situation where the rising price of food really may have an impact on the EU's budget."
"We must not ignore this."
"My conclusion is that in a changing society, we must also be prepared to change the EU's budget."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Mr President, as many people have mentioned, 2009 will be an exciting year for the EU in many ways."
"The European Parliament elections and the new appointment of the Commission, together with the anticipated entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, will make the practical work in connection with the 2009 budget quite difficult."
"This is why we have decided to allow this year's budget to be a general test of the new rules, so that we can gain experience."
"In future, we should start the budget process earlier in the year and involve the technical committees in a better way."
"In addition, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her excellent initiatives in connection with this."
"Today we are discussing the first announcements concerning the EU's budget for 2009."
"It is of course important that there is a clear link between the political priorities, both before and after their implementation in the Commission's annual legislative programme, so that the EU's budget appears as an integrated political instrument."
"We have a problem here, as the multiannual financial framework is too constrained on many points."
"The EU now has a common energy and climate policy, yet there is no common funding to support this policy."
"The component of the budget that finances research, innovation, education and transport is clearly inadequate."
"Similarly, the frameworks for legal and asylum policy and for culture and health policy is much too constrained."
"In addition, the EU's foreign policy is chronically underfunded - priorities such as Kosovo and Palestine indicate the challenges that we face."
"Therefore, it is important that we now discuss the forthcoming mid-term review of the budget to ensure that the EU can continue to finance important political priorities after 2009."
"We need flexibility and better opportunities for reprioritisation within the framework."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the UEN Group, I wish to draw your attention to the following issues in the debate on budgetary priorities for 2009."
"First, if the Lisbon Treaty is ratified by all the Member States, in 2009 powers will be transferred from the Member States to the EU, giving the European Union new areas of responsibility."
"This, in my opinion, will have a significant impact on expenditure from the Union's budget."
"Second, the year 2009 - according to expert forecasts - will in all probability be the fifth successive year in which there has been a steady increase in the prices of foodstuffs."
"This will cause increasing social problems among the poorer Member States, and also in the countries to which the European Union gives food aid."
"The Union's budget for 2009 should allow for more support both for growth of agricultural production in Europe, and for the export of agricultural produce by the Union."
"Finally, my third point concerns the prevention of climate change, which is one of the budgetary priorities for 2009."
"This will put additional burdens on the economies of Member States, unfortunately without making any allowances for the delays in their development."
"This will put the new Member States in a particularly difficult situation and could lead to serious and detrimental economic and social consequences in those countries."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, shows immense technical skill and professionalism in her work."
"Our group supports the call in the report for solidarity within the Union and a balance in regional development, and wants to see greater transparency and clarity in the budget."
"It is important to give attention to the mid-term review of the budgetary framework for the years to come in 2009, even though the outcome of the new negotiations will not yet have an impact on next year's budget."
"Our group has always made the comment that the Union's budget lacks the tools for building the EU's social dimension."
"That is one of the reasons why we could not accept the final draft budget proposals in December."
"Our group also believes that the Union's trend towards militarisation will continue if the Lisbon Treaty is adopted."
"It will add new elements to the work of the Union: a security and defence policy and permanent structural cooperation."
"We observe how the Council is continually proposing new appropriations for the Union's budget and how Parliament is ready to accept them."
"An attempt to include the Athens financing mechanism in the joint budget is the conclusion one reaches from the determination with which the Council proceeds towards Union militarisation and from its consistent calls for more military appropriations."
"We also note that next year's budget contains no clear budget policy on the costs the Union will incur for Kosovo and how they will be paid."
"There are unforeseen costs looming for the commitment of some Member States."
"This is for the promotion of the national independence of an ethnic-based community which is unique in the European context."
"(EL) Mr President, we are today inaugurating the 2009 budget, with its various special features."
"It is the last budget of the current parliamentary term and of the Barroso Commission."
"In all probability, it will be the first budget to fall between the current and new legislative frameworks."
"This budget will be brought in by the Lisbon Treaty, and as you know, it involves the European Parliament in many significant areas of competence."
"When there are many areas of competence there are also usually many responsibilities."
"In this context I should like to make four points about the 2009 budget."
"The first point is that the budget must have added community value and not merely give the impression of the end of an era."
"I welcome what the Commissioner said."
"The reinforcement of Frontex, for example, is a qualitative element showing that even in the last year of the five-year cycle of the Commission and the Parliament we can tackle new challenges."
"My second point is that it must be a developmental budget, not one that will fund micro-programmes and modest priorities."
"In the prevailing atmosphere of economic crisis surrounding us, we must emphasise problems requiring developmental responses."
"The third point is that for any new policy priority we must also have new possibilities of funding."
"To be plain, new targets mean new money."
"Finally, as 2009 will be a year of elections, I appeal to the Commission."
"When you present the preliminary draft budget to us, do so in a simple and comprehensible way."
"It is time for the citizens of Europe to be able to understand, easily the budget, which is about them."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate on the Haug report, I believe, represents a first essential step towards the politicisation of the budget procedure."
"One way or another, 2009 will be a very full political year for Europe and our Parliament: parliamentary elections will be taking place, I hope the new Lisbon Treaty will be implemented and quite a number of changes will come into force in own Parliament."
"In the midst of all these developments, the budget will undergo fundamental changes."
"This is what is being prepared for in political terms in this report."
"Let me focus on four important points in the procedure and report."
"Firstly, it is important to react in good time to prepare for the new situation."
"The next budget, which, as we have all said, will be the first of the new procedure, must be based on foundations already laid down so that it can work correctly."
"I should like to emphasise the second point because the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has been calling for it for many years: opening up the procedure to the other committees."
"Here, the rapporteur's initiative is very important."
"We have debated not only with the Committee on Budgets but also with the other committees about the policy priorities."
"Thirdly, we must strive both now and every year to reflect the policy priorities of this Parliament according to what the budget says."
"Here, I believe that the primary issues are the huge subject of poverty, agriculture, development and technology."
"Fourthly and lastly, and I am just finishing, Mr President, is the importance of the pilot programmes."
"They give us a vital glimpse at what will happen over the coming years in the EU."
"(PT) Mr President, among the important aspects affecting the 2009 budget is the planned review of the Community budget."
"The exact form of this review has yet to be defined, but we are concerned about some of the objectives already indicated for the review."
"Moreover, with regard to the guidelines adopted by the Commission and the Council, it is clear that there will be a repeat of what happened in 2007 and 2008, namely, that spending will once again fall short of the limits laid down in the multi-annual financial framework, already insufficient to meet the needs of real social cohesion in the European Union."
"In addition, there are increasing signs that the allocation for 'expenditure' on social cohesion will not be used."
"At the same time, there is an increase in the allocation for the EU's external action, namely, intervention in theatres of war, which we reject."
"In brief, insufficient funds for priorities we agree with and more funds for priorities we reject."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to begin by strongly supporting the words of the rapporteur and also by appealing to Parliament's specialist committees really to concentrate on projects with European added value when it comes to what I hope will be prompt consideration of the pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"Addressing the Commission and the Council, let me add that in the course of the debate we finally want an answer to the question how we can at last restore health to our foreign and security policy that is suffering from several years of chronic under-funding, to bring an end to the annual disputes in this area that benefit nobody and are also damaging to the Commission and the Council."
"The Commissioner said she would respond to the outcome of Bali in the preliminary draft budget, along the lines of formulating a new Asia strategy."
"But I would like to know when the Commission intends to present proposals on the budgetary implications of the Reform treaty, for the period up to 2013."
"Or are we supposed to wait for the next financial programming period?"
"After all, we are concerned here with new aspects of immigration policy, climate change, energy policy, judicial cooperation and foreign and security policy."
"We have heard nothing on those subjects."
"Let me add that as part of this budgetary procedure we must create the framework for implementing the new treaty once it has been ratified, which means that we must - proceeding with due care and sensitivity - take account of the need to adjust the agreements, in relation both to the ratification process and to the legal basis."
"That is most important."
"There are three aspects here."
"Where do we need preliminary agreements to ensure the appropriate transition from the old to the new treaty?"
"Where do we need transitional agreements to ensure legal certainty?"
"And where do we need a little more time to get subsequent agreements underway on the basis of the necessary legislative procedures?"
"I want to make it quite clear - to the forthcoming French Presidency too - that any agreements we can reach in regard to those three aspects will depend on the results, and we must retain a degree of flexibility so that we do not set everything in stone from the outset and then have to break it up again with a sledge-hammer."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all I wish Jutta Haug bon courage in this important task, which she is taking on for the second time."
"2008 will after all be a very important year, not only because we have to draw up the ordinary budget for 2009 - as many speakers have said - but also because we have to work out a procedure for agreeing the 2010 budget under the new treaty."
"This year is the time to demonstrate exactly what Parliament can and cannot do."
"There is still a considerable lack of clarity over agriculture."
"From a careful reading of the treaty it seems that the Council can, this time, set the prices and quotas unilaterally."
"How does that sit with our new budgetary powers on agriculture for category II?"
"We are supposed to have equal powers."
"Sorting that out has to be a priority."
"Food and energy policy remains important and perhaps we can resolve this within the 5% margin afforded us by the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"I urge the Commission to give thought to it."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Haug, for her excellent work and cooperation."
"She does indeed show professionalism and at this crucial stage the budget is surely destined for a happy outcome at the end of the year if this cooperation continues."
"Is our budget sufficiently transparent for us to be able to gain the public's confidence when the elections take place in 2009?"
"At the same time, however, we are preparing for a post-Lisbon time, and this is especially true of foreign policy, for example, and we need to prepare ourselves for a time when Parliament too shows that it has the will to contribute to this new approach to foreign policy."
"I want to say something important while this budget is still being drafted."
"I hope that the Commission will produce an initiative which the rapporteur could then develop. It relates to the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"I have heard that the Commission is working on such a strategy and I have also heard that Sweden, when it eventually holds the Presidency, intends to make the Baltic Sea Strategy a top priority."
"This strategy will be of no importance if it does not have any money behind it."
"At present we have many different pilot projects here and there."
"This entire Baltic policy is a patchwork quilt, both in terms of its finances and politically."
"That is why we need a separate heading entitled the Baltic Sea Strategy, so that we can implement the right kind of environmental policy, the right kind of transport policy and even the right kind of energy policy, as we know that a gas pipe will be passing though the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany."
"That is why we need this initiative, and I hope that the Commission will show some on this occasion."
"(LV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, from the procedural viewpoint the EU's budget for 2009 can be seen as preparation for two important issues."
"Firstly, with the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty the EU budget procedure has changed significantly and we need to do the necessary preparatory work to ensure clarity and successful work on the European Union's budget for 2010."
"Secondly, we need to speed up the review of the EU budget, including issues concerning the reform of the common agricultural policy and the UK rebate, in order to ensure a successful mid-term report on the financial perspective."
"The policy priorities set out by the European Commission for 2009 - promoting economic growth and employment, combating climate change and fostering sustainable development - are to be endorsed, but they have to be implemented with the necessary support from the EU budget."
"Unfortunately, the restricted budget amount within the ceiling laid down in the financial framework means that the resources needed to finance the new priorities must be sought within the confines of the existing budget, and we have to redistribute resources."
"It is possible that we will have to change the restrictions on obtaining individual EU budget resources."
"For example, the restriction currently in force for the Structural Funds, that only 3% of resources from the relevant operational programme may be channelled towards energy efficiency measures, prohibits new Member States from reviewing their priorities for obtaining Structural Funds in accordance with the new priorities on Europe's energy strategy and climate change."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I want to give my views on two of the priority points, namely our rapporteur's criticism that EU budgeting lacks transparency, and the Commission's staff policy."
"As rapporteur on the budget I am asking the Commission to address the point of budgetary transparency and to put forward proposals for the next planned reform of the budgetary system."
"The information contained in the actual budget is absolutely inadequate and these lists of numbers are actually no use to us at all."
"So far the Commission has been producing a lot of accompanying documents, which only devalues the budget itself."
"Why not include more information within the budget itself from the outset, which would remove the need for some of the reports that have been requested and please both the Commission and Parliament."
"I will work on those foundations for the next budgetary reform and would ask my fellow Members, even at this stage, to support the preliminary activities, because I would like to have several studies carried out on the subject."
"My second point is this: in its December resolution on the 2007 budget, Parliament called for a progress report on staff screening, wanting it by 30 April 2008."
"I assume we will receive that report in a few days' time."
"This screening that Parliament called for has now turned into one of the Barroso Commission's major success stories."
"The President of the Commission is setting himself up as a reformer, but he can only continue to be taken as a reformer if he draws conclusions from the screening before the end of this Commission's term."
"That means he must undertake a critical review of decentralisation and take the first steps in that direction."
"He owes that not only to the taxpayer and to Parliament but also to his staff, which is currently wasting its time and skills on far too much in-house administration and bureaucracy."
"The Commission also owes it to itself, as given the challenges facing the EU and the important management tasks it is undertaking, we believe that - also in view of the 2009 budget, which as you know does not provide for any new items - it can succeed with those tasks only if it also embarks on the appropriate measures and changes within the administration."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"As one of those who drafted the 2009 budget, I would like to thank Jutta Haug and László Surján for their sound preparatory work."
"To be able to produce a good end result we had to be disciplined and harmonious in our work since we often had to explore new routes."
"And we can be quite confident about the environmental protection concerns in the parts of the APS (Annual Policy Strategy) that are known."
"I welcome all three of the Commission's initiatives."
"As a member of the Central Asia Delegation, I particularly welcome the European Union's new Central Asia Strategy and the increased support."
"I also welcome its intention to promote sustainable development practices in developing countries, especially in biodiversity and energy."
"This is not simply our moral duty."
"It is in our own interests."
"With my fellow Members, I am sure that we will be able to put forward many research projects for support, since this is what our citizens expect. Thank you very much."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like once again to thank Ms Haug for the report and also all the speakers for their comments: not only those related directly to the 2009 budget, but also those comments that went beyond 2009, which are very useful in the context of our reflection on the policy agenda and on the future reform of the budget."
"Concerning the Baltic Sea strategy, I would like to react to two very concrete points which were raised."
"Firstly, on the Baltic Sea strategy: the Commission is working on this strategy, and I have the pleasure of chairing the inter-service work on this strategy."
"It is envisaged that it will be on the agenda of the Swedish presidency, which means the second half of 2009."
"However, we are at the stage of consulting and taking stock of the situation in the region and also considering ideas for this strategy."
"With regard to any budget consequences, it is far too early to talk about this today."
"Concerning the new Treaty and the consequences for the policy agenda, one issue is the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty for the institutional change and the new legal frameworks."
"The other thing is the policy agenda and, as you know, both the Council and the Commission are currently involved in the reflection and very concrete work, mostly on the legal frameworks and new institutional challenges."
"However, reflection on the policy agenda is also taking place, as you know, as a result of the requirement to have the budget review."
"I believe that towards the end of this year - or very early in 2009 - the Commission will come forward with the new policy agenda, and only then can the budgetary consequences be considered and taken care of in a reasonable way and with reasonable responsibility."
"Concerning transparency, I have taken note of all your points on screening results and shall forward them, especially to Commissioner Grybauskaitė, but I think to the entire college, and I would like to confirm what you have just said."
"With regard to 2009, my understanding is that we are now aware of the guidelines which were expressed by both arms of the budgetary authority."
"The preliminary draft budget will be based on sound estimates of the need to achieve all those priorities that have been already agreed and which are ahead of us."
"There is no doubt that the Commission will need good ongoing cooperation with you to attain these results."
"I would also like to say that good cooperation will also be essential in the context of long-term challenges, both the institutional and the policy agenda ones."
"Thank you very much for the debate."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I thank all the speakers in this debate."
"I am, of course, also grateful for the good wishes and praise I have received."
"Let me also thank the Commissioner."
"If I have understood correctly, the Commission is supporting us all the way and promising a preliminary draft budget that will take account of everything we want taken into account."
"We have once again made our priorities plain."
"They are neither few in number, nor are they exactly small: tackling climate change, creating growth and employment, a social Europe, research, training, education, aid for the poorest countries in the world, fulfilling our tasks in the world."
"It is not easy actually to finance all that."
"I wish the Council had been listening, for then it would have seen that - thank God! - all, or at least nearly all the parliamentary groups stand united here."
"For that, I warmly thank all concerned."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Hübner has just said that the Commission and the Council are both already working on matters relating to transposition of the Lisbon Treaty."
"That is wonderful!"
"However, as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I would like to insist on behalf, I believe, of all fellow Members that Parliament is treated as an equal, including in regard to the forwarding of documents and non-papers on everything that will have to be discussed and negotiated jointly in the coming months, rather than as a second-rate institution."
"Unless we are certain of that, we will face major problems at the end of the procedure, at the end of the year."
"It is in the interest of the Commission and of the Council to ensure completely equal treatment in information policy too, in regard to documents and matters under consideration."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would just like to say very clearly that I cannot imagine that these three institutions would not work together."
"The same is true, I assume, when it comes to Parliament working with the Commission and with the Council."
"This is our common Treaty, our common achievement and our common task."
"I can only pass your words on to President Barroso, but I am sure that everybody is fully aware of this responsibility."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 22 April 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) The Lisbon Treaty, which is due to come into force on 1 January next, will bring an unprecedented strengthening of Parliament's prerogatives."
"Before the end of this year, we will have to sign an interinstitutional agreement taking account of the extension of codecision and the end of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure."
"In that context, we should emphasise that we are determined to press our case in the mid-term renegotiation of the financial framework for 2007-2013 and through the policy reorientation that we want to achieve, based on a budget that is fully commensurate with our ambitions and does not undermine the principles of solidarity that we hold dear."
"While we must always be concerned to make our policies more efficient, we shall have to guard against any possible attempt at renationalising the CAP and regional policies."
"It is also important that we should be able to facilitate the emergence of new and useful policies through the budgetary tools that Parliament has at its disposal in the form of the flexibility instrument, pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"In addition, the European Commission needs to improve budgetary transparency so that we can properly monitor the use of public funds."
"in writing. - We ought to prepare for the changes set to take place in 2009 with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and the European elections as they will have a major impact on the budget."
"The new elected Parliament and designated Commission will indeed have to deal with new budget procedures."
"It is therefore necessary to present for 2009 transparent and viable budgetary framework and priorities."
"Among other aspects, it is essential to ensure that the budget matches the priorities with sufficient resources."
"In this respect, I am glad to notice that our rapporteur, Mrs HAUG, puts the emphasis on the importance of the principle of solidarity as one of the cornerstones of European policies, especially with regard to cohesion and structural policies."
"With new challenges ahead and the new inter-institutional balance within the institutional triangle it is even more essential to ensure coherence between policy priorities and the financial resources that are made available."
"There are growing concerns that the re-prioritization toward competitiveness, climate change or sustainable development would be made at the costs of other priorities budgets."
"Adding new priorities in the future should at no cost hamper the achievement of other political priorities such as solidarity."
"in writing. - (RO) I would like to emphasize certain aspects related to the article reaffirming the importance of the principle of solidarity in this report."
"The cohesion policy continues to draw one third of the European Union's annual budget."
"Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that this field has become less and less important, as compared to the increases recorded in the competitiveness policy for economic growth and employment."
"For instance, as compared to 2007, budget line 1a - for competitiveness - has recorded an increase of 18.4%, while 1b - which covers the field of cohesion - only a 3.1% increase."
"Moreover, we should take into consideration the effects of the Lisbon Treaty's implementation on the cohesion policy."
"Structural funds - which are currently non-mandatory expenses and on which the Parliament has the last say in the budgetary procedure - will become the subject of a joint decision of the Council of Ministers and the Parliament."
"Nevertheless, it is known that every year, the Council operates important reductions of the European amounts designed for the cohesion policy."
"For this reason, I believe it is very important to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy, yet without neglecting the disparities continuing to exist between the European regions."
"Proposed hearing of the Commission on crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes (8 April 2008) (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to report on the hearing on crimes committed by totalitarian regimes in order to address legitimate concerns raised by Parliament."
"On 8 April 2008 the Commission and the Slovenian Presidency held a hearing on crimes committed by totalitarian regimes."
"This hearing was requested by the Council in April 2007 during the negotiations on the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia."
"The purpose of the hearing was to gain a better understanding of how the Member States have coped with the legacy of totalitarian crimes and of the nature of the methods and practices that have been adopted in order to face up to this challenge."
"The hearing focused on two main themes: the recognition of totalitarian crimes, and reconciliation."
"Given the sensitive nature of this issue and to prevent the matter from being exploited in any way, the Commission was keen for this debate to be, first and foremost, a debate among independent experts and academics from a variety of backgrounds who were committed to a scientifically based approach."
"The Member States were invited to attend, as was the European Parliament, and I am delighted that many MEPs were given the opportunity to take part in the debate."
"The hearing was conducive to constructive and dispassionate debate."
"In general, four issues emerged from the discussions that were of particular concern to the Commission."
"Firstly, there is the feeling that the old Member States should be made more aware of the tragic past of the new Member States."
"This lack of recognition should be carefully reviewed so as to avoid the Union being divided on such a serious matter, one which should actually unite us."
"Secondly, it emerged from the debates that establishing the truth is a prerequisite for reconciliation."
"The spirit of reconciliation that informs the process of European integration is more important now than ever before."
"The various experiences of reconciliation discussed during the hearing demonstrated how complex this task is, but also that there is reason to be optimistic."
"They show that respect for fundamental rights is an essential factor in achieving genuine reconciliation."
"Thirdly, there seem to be many different ways of dealing with the issues of recognition and reconciliation."
"There is no one-size-fits-all model, and each Member State must find whichever one best suits its circumstances."
"Finally, the debates revealed that the European institutions are being called on to address these issues more fully."
"During the hearing, a group of participants submitted a document in which they put forward a large number of proposals for action."
"The Commission has noted this call for greater European involvement on these issues; however, it must be emphasised that it is up to each Member State to find its own way of dealing with the remembrance of these crimes and of addressing these issues."
"The European Union cannot replace the Member States in this task."
"The European Union has very few powers to act in this area."
"Its role is to facilitate this process by encouraging discussion, fostering the sharing of experience and best practices, and bringing the various players together."
"All contributions to the hearing must now be analysed; however, I should like to reiterate the Commission's determination to continue the process set in motion by the Council Declaration of April 2007."
"The Commission must report to the Council two years after the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia enters into force, after which time, it will be possible to hold a political debate."
"In the meantime, the Slovenian Presidency plans to publish the contributions received during the hearing."
"For its part, the Commission intends to initiate a study to gain a factual overview of the various methods, legislation and practices used in the Member States to deal with the issue of remembering totalitarian crimes."
"With regard to the importance of the educational and citizenship aspects, the Commission will also consider how existing Community programmes can be further used to raise awareness of these issues across Europe."
"In conclusion, it is important to promote an objective and dispassionate discussion of these issues, and to move forward gradually within the limits of the powers of the Union."
"The Commission is naturally prepared to participate fully in this process."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, while talking, debating and approaching an essential common position on the evaluation of crimes of totalitarian regimes in Europe, one obstacle is most evident as a barrier to more rapid moral and legislative success."
"That main obstacle is the hardly understandable position of today's Russian Government."
"As far as the crimes committed in the Stalinist past of the USSR are concerned, instead of distancing themselves with proper condemnation of gross crimes against humanity, war crimes and other wrongdoings, Russia's ruling elite is not following the good example of denazified Germany."
"No, the Soviet Führer, Stalin, is praised, his own and his gang's crimes denied or marginalised and the victims humiliated and mocked."
"This strange political behaviour, so detrimental to Russia itself, cannot tear out the truth about deeds but continues to affect wrongly our European standards and fairness of evaluations."
"We should realise how such hypocrisy and double standards are helpful for various neo-Nazis etc. If anyone says: well, before official Russia changes its mind, we have to freeze ours and follow the Kremlin's mind or postpone our evaluations and decisions, that is an entirely and deeply wrong stance."
"No matter how harshly Russian-State-hired political historians will try to rewrite the European history of the facts, the two bloodiest international tyrannies of the 20th century, along with the smaller national dictatorships, should and will be assessed properly."
"This has to be the best way Europe can assist the Russia of the future."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, our group helped to bring about this debate because we are concerned at the growing number of party-political interpretations of the past."
"I speak here not just as a politician, as a Social Democrat, but as a historian too."
"Interpretations of this kind often perpetuate myths which can be a breeding ground for xenophobia, for example, because they only present one side of the story."
"That, of course, is very dangerous in a Europe of great diversity, including ethnic diversity."
"There are no easy answers to difficult questions of history."
"That misconception is often created by those who put a populist spin on historical events."
"Falsifying the past is also used to make people forget it, for example denying the Holocaust or covering up the crimes of other totalitarian regimes."
"And there is also the danger of being selective."
"Historical criteria are sometimes applied to one situation and not to another."
"Sometimes no distinction is made at all and one situation is judged in the same way as another."
"The result is that people get confused and do not know how they ought to feel about the past - the politicians have hijacked historical truth because it is all too easy to draw comparisons."
"Our group sees this as especially important this year, as this year we commemorate the Prague uprising, the Prague Spring, but also Kristallnacht."
"We think it is important that Commission and the Council should give a lead and encourage a debate based on facts, based on scientific research."
"Not in an attempt to reach some kind of common position, but to ensure people realise that our discussion is based on correct information."
"And to ensure that the debate can be continued properly."
"Once again I should stress that the aim here is not, of course, to airbrush important and terrible episodes out of our history."
"Of course not, the aim above all is to learn from them."
"But we have to make sure that history is not misused."
"This is an important moral issue."
"I think it is important to make the point once again that in our debate this afternoon and this evening we should also give the floor to a number of fellow Members who have had personal experience of the consequences of totalitarian regimes."
"For us this is an important debate, which we shall certainly be taking further in the course of the year."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I believe that all the wrongs committed by totalitarian regimes - whether fascist, communist or Stalinist - must be thoroughly exposed."
"But I am not in favour of criminalising in themselves the denial or condoning of such crimes, whether the Holocaust, the Shoah, genocide war crimes or crimes against humanity committed by any totalitarian or authoritarian regimes, any more than I am in favour of the criminalising of the so-called public provocation or apology for - or glorification of - terrorism."
"In all these cases, I believe that freedom of speech should be paramount, and that criminal law should only be brought in when there is clear incitement to hatred, to violence or to terrorism."
"Any freedom of expression is essential to establishing the truth."
"One theme of the hearing was redress for injustice, and it is not possible to have justice without truth."
"The greatest illustration of this was in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa."
"And I believe that one of the proudest achievements of the European Union and its Member States in the last decade was the establishment of the International Criminal Court."
"But there are still many people walking the planet who are walking with impunity, and I believe that we are not doing enough in Europe to bring them to justice."
"I do not know what happened to the spirit that led the EU to support the International Criminal Court, when it came to being honest about collusion in torture flights and secret prisons."
"We have had no satisfactory response from the Member States to our report of a year ago about such collusion."
"We learn in the United States that torture at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere was mandated at the highest level of the Bush Administration."
"This has led to a tragic loss of moral authority and reputation for the United States."
"Yes, we must bring truth to these crimes - but do not criminalise what needs to be thoroughly discussed."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the two most cruel totalitarian regimes of the 20th century, German Nazism and Soviet- and Chinese-style communism, committed heinous crimes."
"The total number of victims probably exceeds 100 million dead and martyred in the Holocaust and through mass executions and deportations, artificially generated hunger, in death and concentration camps."
"The Nazi system murdered people on racial grounds; the communist system for reasons of social class."
"The ideologies which provided the foundations of these systems excluded whole groups of citizens from the rule of law and designated them for death or for physical and social degradation in order to construct a new, allegedly better society."
"A special kind of hatred was held towards religions."
"Within these systems not only was there a monopoly of power, but also one of language, which was turned into a tool of propaganda and terror."
"Today, more than 60 years after World War II ended, more than a dozen years after the fall of Soviet communism, it is amazing that within the European Union there are still people who refuse to recognise that communism was a criminal system."
"Many ruses are being used to relativise communism's past."
"What moral argument is there to support the contention that the victims of Nazism are more important than those of communism?"
"Why are we unable to produce some common resolution on this?"
"Commissioner, this is not a matter for individual Member States only."
"If the Union considers itself to be responsible and competent to deal with racism and xenophobia, it should muster sufficient courage to deplore communist crimes too."
"I say this not only as a politician, but as a historian."
"The similarities between both these systems do not necessarily lead to arguments about their compatibility."
"To stress the uniqueness of communist crimes does not diminish the Nazi crimes at all, and vice versa."
"Put simply, common decency and remembrance of the countless victims of these regimes requires condemnation of both."
"The working group we have set up in Parliament, called United Europe United History, which already has some 50 Members, will be soliciting just such a condemnation."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think our duty in this matter is threefold."
"First, we must manage to formulate a uniform European interpretation of war and the reasons for war, that is to say a common European memory."
"There is no point in continuing with this unending discussion and comparing Stalinist crimes with Nazi crimes."
"Those are two separate examples of totalitarianism, two separate criminal systems, although they do sometimes have structural similarities."
"Surely we can take the whole debate about openness, democracy, etc., as expressing a common interpretation."
"The common response is, for example, the European Union, or the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which basically reflect the lessons learned from those two totalitarian systems that created such destruction on our continent."
"Secondly, if we look around us in the world, we see Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, and so on. That means the destruction of human beings is continuing."
"What we need - as Baroness Ludford rightly said - is the International Criminal Court, and common rules."
"Today we must seek to ensure that all civilised states recognise the International Criminal Court so that crimes of that kind, which differ, which are not all the same, but which are all crimes in some form, really can be brought to justice."
"We will only be able to counter such crimes if we can bring those responsible to justice, wherever they are, whether in Guantánamo, in Darfur, or in Bosnia, among Bosnian Serbs."
"Justice will prevail only if those responsible can be taken to court."
"Those are the lessons of history and that is why I believe that Commission initiatives of this kind are interesting if, in the end, they lead us to formulate a common, anti-totalitarian position."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, we will support any move to eradicate racism and xenophobia, promote fundamental rights and, even more so, condemn unreservedly war crimes, crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide."
"This we will do, whatever the time or the place."
"In this fight, there can be no taboos, neither with regard to the crimes of the past nor in connection with the tragedies currently taking place all over the world."
"In terms of European history, this naturally applies to Nazism."
"This also applies to the fascist regimes of Mussolini, Pétain, Franco, Salazar, as it does to that of the Greek Colonels."
"We are also quite prepared to reiterate a radical condemnation of the atrocious crimes committed under Stalin."
"What happened during the colonial period must not be forgotten either."
"Our unwillingness to compromise must surely apply even more to the racist, xenophobic and overtly neo-fascist tendencies that are still tolerated today at a very high level in some of the Member States, both new and old, of the European Union."
"There is only one thing that might be deemed unacceptable, not by our group especially but by those who have made personal sacrifices in the fight against the worst genocide in modern history, and that is the attempt surreptitiously to trivialise Nazism by placing it in a generic category that includes, in particular, Stalinism and even the regimes existing in central and eastern Europe prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"I should like to quote you three statements made recently from among many more on this subject, all of which speak for themselves."
"Firstly, this excerpt from a statement made by the German Union of Survivors of the Neuengamme Concentration Camp."
"I quote:"
"(DE) 'The Neuengamme Association has always opposed equating National Socialism with Stalinism.'"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Next, this comment made by the Advisory Board of Former Prisoners of Buchenwald."
"And I quote: 'Those who seek to generalise distort the significance of Nazi barbarism in Germany's history.'"
"Finally, these words spoken by the Secretary General of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, denouncing those who venture to draw a comparison between the former GDR and the Nazi regime; and I quote: 'Any attempt to draw a parallel between them is to diminish the magnitude of the denial of rights, deportation and mass extermination of millions of innocent men, women and children during the Nazi dictatorship.'"
"Thank you for devoting some thought to these statements."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, war is one thing, the destruction of nations and crimes against humanity quite another."
"Not every war aims to exterminate the losing side, and a nation can be destroyed without war."
"Often overwhelming hatred against the conquerors and oppressors filled the souls of those being wronged - this is how Hannibal and Mithidrates saw the Romans."
"But this is not comparable to the feelings of enmity born in the souls of the criminals of the 20th century."
"The history of that century came to be much more than just a sum of wrongs suffered by certain nations."
"It became an addendum to the history of humanity, and of inhumanity."
"Kant, the philosopher, formulated the following imperative: act so that humanity, in whatever shape, is for you an end, and not merely the means to an end."
"The origin of the crime of genocide has often been fiercely debated."
"It would be better to ask why nobody prevented such crimes at the right time."
"In totalitarian politics, everything was planned and calculated."
"Its first prescription was not to reveal anything prematurely, to pretend to be a friend until the last moment."
"I mention this because today openly para-fascist and para-communist groups exist in many countries."
"This is why the first two sessions of the European Hearing, on the subject of history of totalitarian crimes, were so important."
"Let us speak plainly in order to clearly define what may not under any circumstances be subject to the so-called historical revisionism."
"Genocide is not a phenomenon which can be opposed by a single nation."
"It must be opposed by the society of the entire civilised world."
"This is one of the reasons why it is a common task for the European Union."
"(BG) During the 20th century, in addition to the totalitarian regimes of communism and nazism, there is another fact: the atrocious assaults against the human rights of the Bulgarian and the Armenian people by the Ottoman Empire."
"For almost five centuries, under the rule of the Ottoman state, the violence against the Bulgarian people was marked by the features of genocide."
"A considerable part of the Bulgarian population was taken away into slavery, exterminated or forcibly converted to Islam, which is basically a purposeful ethnic cleansing."
"Another undeniable fact is the forcible deportation and killing of over one and a half million Armenians by the Turkish authorities between 1915 and 1917."
"All of these acts against Bulgarians and Armenians fully match the elements of crimes defined in UN instruments on the prosecution and punishment of genocide."
"The recognition of genocide against Armenians and Bulgarians would send a clear signal to the Republic of Turkey to assume its liability and apologize for the five centuries of oppression against the Bulgarians and for the crimes and mass murders committed, and to compensate the heirs of refugees for the suffering and for the private estates stolen from them which remain on Turkish territory."
"(FR) Commissioner, forgive me, but I was very deeply shocked by your introduction to this debate."
"You told us that the Commission had held a dispassionate debate on crimes against humanity."
"You spoke of how complex this task is, and, in conclusion, you said that the European Union had very few powers in this area."
"When she was two months old, the wife of your Estonian colleague, Sim Kallas, with whom you are well acquainted, was deported by Stalin, along with her mother and grandmother."
"Another of your colleagues, Mr Frattini, who will soon be leaving us, said in his letter to Mr Landsbergis: 'Your history - referring to Lithuania's suffering under Stalin - your history is our history.'"
"Commissioner, in your reply, perhaps you could explain things in greater depth, as it may be that I have misunderstood."
"I believe that it is here in Parliament and in the Council that a great deal has been done to remember the forgotten dead."
"For we do not talk like politicians; we address the general public."
"There are people still living today in Poland and in the Baltic States who have lost their parents, their grandparents, but no one remembers them."
"I do not believe that a debate on the suffering of six million Jews can be dispassionate."
"Therefore, the length of such a debate and the manner in which it is conducted are extremely important factors."
"As your colleague would say, the history of central and eastern Europe is our history."
"The problem for us British and for us French is that we were Stalin's allies at the end of the War."
"It took 30 years for the British to admit that Katyn was a Stalinist crime."
"The perpetrator was not Hitler."
"(DE) Mr President, we Social Democrats have been persecuted by every totalitarian and authoritarian regime of the 20th century, whether by the Nazis or by the thugs of Stalin, Franco or Mussolini - the list is long."
"That is why we not only have no problem with but actually welcome a reappraisal of the crimes under Stalinism."
"We can only applaud it."
"Yet this reappraisal should follow the rules of historical methodology and not be confused with the rules governing criminal court proceedings."
"We must guard against confusing these matters."
"It is not a question of counting up the victims or of a re-run of the Nuremberg Trials; this time we are trying an ideology rather than identified criminals."
"There are, however, also points at which we must quite clearly say 'no' and we Social Democrats have identified a few of them."
"We say 'no' to the attempt to establish a new framework for interpreting European history, which emerged from the speeches made by some Members of this House at a conference held on 22 January this year."
"We are deeply opposed to the view that the extermination of European Jews by the Nazis came from a conception of history that was developed by the Soviet regime."
"We reject that view."
"We reject it all the more firmly because in 2006 we found that another colleague from the same ideological spectrum sent a roundmail to all Members of this House in which he described the two Latvian Waffen-SS divisions as part of the German forces, thereby playing down their role."
"We reject that interpretation too, especially in connection with the first sentence."
"We also reject the assertion that the West did nothing to bring about change in what was then the Soviet-ruled part of Europe."
"It was the CSCE in Helsinki that first gave the civil rights movements in those countries room to breathe, with the successful and happy result we see today as we welcome representatives from those countries to our House."
"These are points we insist on and will continue to pursue."
"(LV) Mr President, at the European Parliament we are accustomed to talk about common values, about a common and truthful history, but sometimes misunderstandings arise."
"Commissioner Barrot, I think that you said rightly that in Europe it is still necessary to establish the truth."
"What we are talking about is reconciliation, but perhaps not to the extent that Mr Cohn-Bendit has proposed."
"Thank you, though, to Commissioner Frattini for the hearing that was organised."
"I was able to participate and also on various occasions to speak in the hearing."
"I think that the debate was pithy."
"Unfortunately, what was missing was a clear, resolute, focused statement on further action."
"Unfortunately, Russian representatives repeatedly continued to explain away the crimes committed by totalitarian communism in the territories occupied by the USSR."
"Russia's reaction is no surprise, but what will the European Union do?"
"Will it continue to maintain double standards?"
"Will it demand the acknowledgement of Nazi crimes in the denial of events or their gross trivialisation in the Member States?"
"Will it demand that custodial sentences of up to three years be imposed?"
"Will it, at the same time, turn a blind eye to the crimes of the USSR's totalitarian regime?"
"Some of the victims of the Soviet totalitarian regime are still alive, but the European Union's position does not offer them any satisfaction - in fact, worse than that, it continues to humiliate them."
"We are talking about EU citizens."
"The European Parliament ought to range itself against such injustice."
"Unfortunately, we repeatedly see the chairs of the political groups deciding not to table a resolution on this issue."
"Therefore, we cannot have a written record of the thoughts we are expressing here today."
"Commissioner Barrot, I call upon you not to depart from this important goal, but to strive for a uniform understanding and truthful history in the name of reconciliation."
"Thank you."
"(HU) Mr President, the anti-Ceauşescu uprising in Romania started at my church."
"I have had painful experience of what communism really is and it is therefore with a sense of satisfaction that I note that the European Union's attention is once again focused on the criminal actions of totalitarian regimes."
"In cases of crimes against humanity committed in the eras of national socialism and communism the world still applies a double standard."
"Unlike the case of fascism, there has yet been no trial of communism."
"Both types of dictatorial regime suppressed freedom, human rights and churches."
"They crippled the lives of their national minorities."
"The huge scale of human and social tragedy is common to fascism and communism."
"Political, historical, human and moral restitution has hardly begun and must be continued."
"Take the example of Romania and the Tismăneanu report."
"It is my conviction that, for the regime change begun there in 1989 to be complete, the events of the past must be confronted."
"Real European integration of former communist countries requires not just truth and restitution but also the condemnation of dictatorship."
"Mr President, in just the same way as the Baltic Sea became an internal EU sea in 2004, so the historical experiences of the 10 new Member States that suffered under the totalitarian rule of communism have become an all-European problem."
"I absolutely agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit: we need a uniform or common interpretation of our common history."
"So it is not a question of condemnation; it is a question of moral and political assessment of all the crimes."
"We are called upon to guarantee that all crimes against humanity, all acts of genocide and classicide and all war crimes should be treated equally."
"Justice belongs to all citizens of Europe without any exception."
"In that sense, I am a bit disappointed with the Commission statement, because the main theme is that the assessment of communist totalitarianism will be an internal affair for every relevant country."
"I am afraid it is going to deepen double standards, because clearly Nazism and fascism are not considered to be internal matters in any of the EU Member States."
"Every emergence of neo-Nazism and racism is viewed as a direct threat to the common values of Europe."
"So, what do we need to do?"
"There are still tens of millions of living victims of communist regimes, as well as their descendents."
"As things stand today, they are bound to feel like second- or third-class victims."
"The famous 'never again' is still not guaranteed for them."
"Lastly, this is not a problem of the past."
"The absence of a political and moral assessment is continuously shaping our present day and is distorting our common future."
"Could one imagine the return of the Soviet KGB leadership to power in Russia or a revival of communist political forces in Germany if there had been an assessment of the communist system at the end of the Cold War?"
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to open today's debate with a reminder of the leader of the Polish Socialist Party, Kazimierz Pużak - who may be considered to be a symbol of this debate."
"Arrested for the first time in the early years of the 20th century, in 1911, Pużak, the leader of the Polish Socialist Party, the leader of the underground Socialist Party during World War II in the struggle against Nazism, and arrested again by the NKVD in 1945, died tragically in a Stalinist prison in Poland on 30 April 1950."
"For us Socialists, democracy, the fight for human rights, for the rule of law, and the principles of liberal democracy were always the foundations of politics."
"This is our inheritance in today's Europe."
"At the same time, Commissioner, I address you in particular; history is today, regretfully, the subject of manipulation, a kind of crusade, colonisation undertaken by the populist right, by nationalist movements."
"This creates paradoxical situations where we have the nationalist right which wants historical research, new tribunals, but at the same time opposes the Charter of Fundamental rights as part of European law."
"An unbelievable paradox, indeed."
"Democracy, the rule of law, liberal democracy, these are the foundations of contemporary Europe."
"The unity of Europe, the Charter of Fundamental rights, the rule of law prevailing all over the world, no acceptance of torture - this is our response stemming from the legacy of the 20th century: the struggle for democracy, the struggle against all manner of dictatorships and against totalitarian regimes."
"(Applause)"
"(PL) Mr President, genocide is defined in international law, and that definition is based on the UN Convention."
"As a Pole - a citizen of a country afflicted by genocide - I believe that this definition should be expanded by two elements."
"It should stress that, as a rule, the purpose of genocide is the liquidation of the feeling of national identity, through the extermination of the intellectual and cultural elites."
"Poland may serve as an example."
"During World War II the Germans and the Russians murdered there, in the first instance, the intelligentsia, the professors, the clergy."
"Secondly consideration should be given to how to punish under international law historical lies, false propaganda, and refusal to acknowledge guilt about genocide."
"An example here is the attitude of Russia in relation to Stalinist crimes, and also towards the Katyń massacre."
"Poland supports the admission of Ukraine to the European Union."
"However, so that history should not divide but unite, we believe that Ukraine should acknowledge the crimes committed against the Poles and the Jews during World War II - when more than 150 thousands of people died."
"The European Union should be an organisation which provides an example of uncompromising fight against genocide to the whole world."
"This is why, as politicians elected by nations, we should condemn communism as a criminal ideology and a criminal system."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a memory of historical events is essential for the process of European construction."
"For this process to be fully successful, it is vital to understand that it represents the elimination of nationalism, totalitarianism, intolerance, autocracy and war, and the establishment of Europeanism, freedom, respect, democracy and peace as the values which govern the way we live together in Europe."
"This is the lesson which we must teach the young people of today: the events of the past and the progress of the present, without hiding the crimes and mistakes which had to be overcome and pointing out the sacrifices entailed in overcoming them."
"To know our history is the antidote to falling into the same trap twice."
"It is only by knowing the truth, the whole truth, that we can move forward."
"We must firmly denounce the barbarities of our past without diminishing them, much less falsifying them; without falling into the Manichean logic of the Cold War, equating the West with good and Eastern Europe with evil."
"We will explain that there were democrats and totalitarians, but without hiding the fact that both Western and Eastern Europe had their totalitarians, both equally odious and criminal."
"As a Spanish democrat, I sympathise with democrats who were victims of Stalinism in their countries, but I also ask them to show solidarity with those in Spain who lived through the oppression and suffering imposed by the dictatorship of General Franco."
"We understand the tragedy of our fellow Europeans in Eastern Europe who went from one form of totalitarianism to another, but they must also understand our tragedy, which entailed maintaining the same criminal form of dictatorship and oppressing our people."
"It is only by knowing the truth, the whole truth, that we can move forward."
"Lastly, we will remember that in Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam, Stalin was not alone; leaders of Western powers shared in his decisions."
"Therefore everyone had their share of responsibility for the partitioning of Europe and for the oppression, punishment and suffering that many millions of Europeans were to experience at the hands of one totalitarian regime or another."
"Certainly central and eastern Europe bear a much greater responsibility for Stalinism, but it is also true that, for my country, the responsibility lay mostly with western democracies who accepted the Franco tyranny established by Hitler and Mussolini as part of their free world and were complicit in his misdeeds."
"Mr President, we have achieved much together as a united Europe, and Europe will be that much stronger, and offer greater guarantees of freedom and democracy, the more its construction is founded on an awareness of the progress represented by sharing in a project which identifies and rejects the dark side of our past in order to build a future dedicated to the values which unite us."
"(PL) I would like to express my satisfaction that today's debate on the matters related to bloody totalitarian systems has been possible."
"It is regrettable that the debate is so short and perfunctory."
"The fact that the usual principle of adopting a suitable resolution has been abandoned provides food for thought."
"It is also curious that at various levels within the Union German national socialism, popularly referred to as Nazism, is being considered and mentioned before anything else."
"International socialism, that is communism, is avoided in silence."
"These systems were linked not only by their common ideological roots, but also by practical cooperation."
"Communism has its origins with Rosa Luxemburg, Liebknecht, Marx, Lenin and Stalin, and led to the planned deaths of tens of millions of inhabitants of central eastern Europe."
"Many bloody crimes, for example the Katyń massacre, are taboo topics to this day, and these crimes may not be called by their proper name, genocide."
"The building of a democratic Europe is possible only on the foundations of truth, including the truth about anti-human communist totalitarianism."
"We owe remembrance and justice not only to the victims of inhuman systems; first of all we owe it to present and future generations so that this situation does not happen again."
"(CS) Mr President, the 20th century in Europe was the century of totalitarian and authoritarian regimes, of Nazism and fascism, of communism and its most terrible offshoot, Stalinism, of various right-wing dictatorships in Spain, Portugal, Greece and other countries."
"The horrors and crimes that are the legacy of these regimes must never be forgotten: I therefore welcome this discussion on the past."
"However, this discussion should take place on the basis of strictly non-partisan, objective and scientific criteria."
"Under no circumstances should it be abused for political purposes; unfortunately, this is often the case."
"For example, if we look at many of the new Member States of the European Union, including my own country - the Czech Republic - we see continuous attacks on everything left of centre, on everything leftist."
"Right-wing politicians, journalists and so-called historians, many of whom used to be members of the former communist regime and obtained the title of doctor or engineer from the communist regime's educational establishments, constantly attack social democratic parties as if they were some kind of communist or post-communist parties, in spite of the fact that it was in fact social democrats who, both at home and in exile, fought communism for 40 years."
"Czech social democrats died in communist prisons; they organised the first anti-communist revolt to take place in the entire former Soviet bloc, in Plzeň on 1 June 1953; they were on the front line of the Prague Spring; they formed the opposition in the 1970s and 1980s."
"I myself had to go into exile, where one of my jobs was as editor of the Voice of America."
"In spite of this, the Social Democratic Party is constantly being denounced as a post-communist party."
"Commissioner, I would therefore like to know what the Commission intends to do to ensure that the discussion about the past is not abused for present-day political and ideological goals."
"(LT) Mr President, it is essential that we talk about the crimes of the totalitarian regimes of Hitler, Stalin and others frankly and honestly - starting with the former Soviet Union and finishing with Spain."
"The neighbouring countries, especially Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, should sincerely offer to participation as well."
"The occupation and annexation of the Baltic states in 1940 was not typical, as it had been attempted to cover it up under the guise of social liberation."
"This was facilitated by the fact that - let us say that for 14 years Lithuania had been under an authoritarian regime, which had quashed democracy and abolished free elections."
"A year ago the European Parliament opened an exhibition in which horrific data were presented by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania."
"During the three years of Nazi occupation in Lithuania 240 thousand people were murdered, among them 200 thousand Jews."
"Over 47 years of Soviet Union occupation nearly 80 thousand Lithuanian people were murdered by the repressive bodies, in exile or in forced labour camps."
"The immeasurable pain and tragedies behind these numbers must be revealed to Europe."
"The actions and principles of Stalin and other communist leaders who encouraged the extermination of millions of people in the name of class struggle were criminal."
"The communist movement has survived for 160 years and has different faces in different countries; however, all communist regimes were antidemocratic."
"At the same time, with Eurocommunism gaining strength, resistance to Moscow's dictate was getting stronger too."
"Let us remember such names as Imre Nagy and Alexander Dubček, the attempts of communists to escape from the vicious circle of dogmas and crimes that other communist party members ruthlessly tried to stifle."
"Can all the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, such as Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev and Gorbachev, be tarred with the same brush?"
"The dictatorial single-party system was destroyed not only by the efforts of dissidents, not even by pressure from the West, but mainly by the activities of the communist party members who strove for change, democracy and the implementation of the human rights."
"I doubt that the EU will ever have a common history policy."
"Nevertheless, it is important to get better acquainted with each country's past so that we are able to appreciate democracy and adopt a brighter future outlook."
"(CS) This is an important day, a day of moral satisfaction for all the victims of totalitarian regimes."
"My father, Štefan Kányai, spent nine and a half years in a Russian gulag."
"In his book he describes the crushing reality accompanying the cruelty of Stalinism, which is something we must remember!"
"I thank you on his behalf."
"I also thank you on behalf of Bishop Ján Vojtaššák, Monsignor Viktor Trstenský, Štefan Putanko, Štefan Janík and thousands of other brave sons of the Slovak nation who were victims of communism."
"The Slovak priest František Dlugoš writes the following in one of his books: 'To investigate the events that took place during the 40 years of the communist regime, to find out people's destinies, means revealing the soul of the nation.'"
"Following today's debate, I can add 'the soul of Europe'."
"I welcome this debate because examining this unique period in time, and the events that took place during this period, can be very beneficial for us now and in the future."
"(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the first time in EU history, with the help of debates on the assessment of totalitarian regimes at EU level, attempts are being made to cause people to consider the crimes of both communism and Nazism to be the terror of totalitarian regimes that caused damage to countries and their people."
"Public condemnation of the crimes of communism, after equating them with those committed by the Nazis, would have a positive impact on EU law, education and culture."
"Crimes committed by the European Nazi regimes have received global damnation, with Nazi parties being banned and Nazi propaganda being punishable by law."
"At the same time the damage inflicted by communist regimes has not yet been properly ascertained."
"Some European countries still have legal communist parties."
"Lithuania is calling on the EU Member States to prepare official reports on the damage caused by crimes committed by totalitarian regimes, particularly Stalinism, and to ask the inheritor of the Soviet Union's obligations - the Russian Federation - to compensate this damage."
"Lithuania has evaluated the damage inflicted during half a century of Soviet occupation at LTL 80 billion."
"Europe should show its solidarity in demanding that those responsible for the damage compensate the EU Member States, as Nazi crime perpetrators have been made to do."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank all MEPs who have taken part in this debate, at what is clearly a critical stage."
"We have heard some particularly moving accounts of past events which some of you have experienced at first hand."
"I should very much like to clear up any misunderstandings."
"In the case of Mr Beazley, in particular, I do think that there has been a misunderstanding."
"I made a speech that had been prepared for me, but I have to say that I may well have been misunderstood."
"Every Member State has responsibilities, it has to be said."
"However, the Union most certainly does intend to face up to its responsibilities."
"We want the truth, we want the whole truth, and if the Commission opened the debate - it was my colleague, Franco Frattini, who opened the debate at the hearing - it is precisely because we want to get to the bottom of the truth."
"This must be made quite clear."
"We want not only each Member State to be held individually responsible for honouring this duty to remember, but also all EU citizens to feel a sense of solidarity and involvement in the tragic events that have taken place in some of our Member States."
"In this respect, I would like to say, and, in fact, I did say in my opening statement, that I am aware that, in the west especially, we have not always grasped the full extent of the atrocities and heinous crimes experienced by our friends from those Member States that have been subjected to various forms of occupation and have lived under Stalinist occupation."
"Therefore, I have come here today, in person, because I would like to reassure you that the Commission will continue this discussion and will ensure that it provides the basis, in particular, for the study that we are going to carry out in order to look at how the various laws and practices have actually been applied in the Member States with a view to remembering totalitarian crimes."
"Obviously, the Council statement does not refer specifically to Stalinist crimes but speaks generally of totalitarian regimes."
"However, it is quite clear from the context in which this statement was adopted, particularly in the Member States that were behind it, that the issue of remembering Stalinist crimes lies at the very heart of this process."
"I believe that this has to be said, and, when I opened this debate, I emphasised that any form of totalitarism, any totalitarian regime that has resulted in a denial of the human person and his fundamental rights, is totally unacceptable."
"In this regard, and some of you have emphasised this point, knowledge about experiences of other types of totalitarian regimes may be helpful in identifying the means by which the very acts of abuse and barbarism that you have condemned actually came about."
"I therefore believe that this study must be very broad in scope and clearly should not disregard any form of totalitarism."
"Nor should this debate provide an opportunity for base political exploitation."
"The Commission is naturally aware of this risk, but were the European Union to remain silent on the tragic past of some of our Member States, this would serve only to increase such a risk and to create a great divide between the new and the old Member States."
"This is why we must move forward together."
"Therefore, Mr President, I should just like to ask what, essentially, is the purpose of all this?"
"It is so that we may guard against any form of revisionism, any historical untruth."
"Secondly, we must also, by remembering, prevent these totalitarian regimes from returning to haunt us."
"Finally, we have a duty of reconciliation that is clearly associated with this approach."
"However, I would also urge that we must look to the future, and some have emphasised the need to move towards the introduction of a directly binding European law to prevent these totalitarian regimes from ever returning to haunt us."
"I should like to reassure you, ladies and gentlemen, that, quite apart from these few words of response, I am personally entirely convinced that we all, as Europeans, have a collective duty of solidarity to establish the truth, our truth as Europeans, without disregarding or diminishing the crimes that have been committed under various totalitarian regimes."
"In this respect, I believe that our friends from Eastern Europe need especially to appreciate that we are committed to seeking the truth and will not rest until it is known."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FI) Mr President, the most precious gift we have from our examination of history is events we know about - facts."
"The more facts we know about, the better."
"Interpretation is always a separate process."
"Everyone should be able to examine and interpret the events that have taken place; that is an ingredient in freedom of speech."
"Political history can rarely be symmetrical in terms of its content but the effort has to be made."
"There are still many areas left unexplored in recent history, thanks partly to political correctness."
"Dictatorships and dictators get very special treatment."
"The crimes of the Nazis deserve no understanding, but communism should not be earning any bonus points either."
"in writing. - (ET) On 8 April the public hearing held by the Slovenian Presidency and the European Commission dealt with an extremely important topic for the European Union."
"In the 20th century Europe lost millions of intellectuals and enterprising citizens because of totalitarian regimes."
"The wounds that were inflicted on our history have not healed to this day."
"The dictator of the Soviet Union, Joseph Stalin, wiped my homeland and the other Baltic countries from the map."
"For half a century we were not allowed to have our own national anthems or flags; and our capital city was Moscow."
"Stalinism and Nazism evolved together and divided Europe with an iron curtain."
"Hitler and Stalin's brutality knew no national borders."
"As a Social Democrat I condemn dictatorships whatever their guise."
"I also stress that Stalinism and Nazism served as direct examples for other totalitarian ideologies."
"Metaxas, Franco, Mussolini, Salazar and a host of lesser dictators perpetrated crimes of their own, following Hitler and Stalin's brutality."
"Their scope remained within the borders of their own countries and for that reason the countries concerned should have responsibility for establishing the true cost."
"An awareness and the study of each other's history is essential so that the citizens of the countries of Europe can start to develop an awareness of the fact that they are also European citizens."
"We need an assessment, based on shared values, of the crimes committed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the KGB."
"Soon, seventy years will have passed since the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact."
"The atrocities of Stalin's apparatus of coercion are still not viewed on a par with Hitler's war machine."
"As a first step on behalf of common approach to history I would urge our governments to designate 23 August as a Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of Stalinism and Nazism."
"in writing. - (ET) Unfortunately it is a fact that although nearly all westerners are aware of the concentration camps of Nazi Germany, most of them have heard nothing about the gulags."
"A survey recently conducted in Sweden among 15-20 year-olds showed that their basic knowledge of communism is very poor, almost non-existent."
"A study showed that 90% of Swedes have never heard of the gulags, while 95% knew what Auschwitz was."
"Unfortunately, my father had experience of both types of camp and therefore I cannot accept the idea that the suffering under the Soviet regime can be considered second-rate, as if there is a fear that talking about it reduces the significance of the crimes of Nazism."
"That attitude must be changed."
"This is not always the simplest of matters for the Socialist Group in the European Parliament as several of the parties within it have a communist past."
"Awareness-raising in the Socialist Group is therefore of even greater importance."
"I remember debates on this same issue when the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, of which I was a member, condemned the crimes of communism a couple of years ago."
"At the time I was one of the people who took the floor and, thanks obviously to the fact that there are so many countries within that organisation with experience of the Soviet regime, condemnation was achieved more quickly than in the European Parliament."
"I am entirely convinced that if the European Union truly espouses its own declared values, it must very clearly express its attitude to the past in terms of those values."
"This is not to rewrite the past, as several critics of this matter have claimed."
"It is to establish the historical truth."
"in writing. - (PL) In the 20th century Europe has experienced many acts of genocide."
"Some of these acts are spoken of much and often, whilst others are shrouded in silence."
"In the press we read most frequently about the Nazi and communist genocides."
"One act of genocide over which there is permanent silence is the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews, Poles and Ukrainians in Polish territory under German occupation during World War II, perpetrated by Ukrainian nationalists from the so-called Ukrainian Insurgent Army."
"A significant part of the cadres of this Army served earlier in Nazi SS units."
"This genocide had the character of genocidum atrox, savage murder, perpetrated with extreme cruelty."
"The total population inhabiting a specific territory was annihilated."
"The victims were put to death and parts of their bodies were cut off or ripped out."
"At present people who participated in these murders are seeking ex-combatant status in Ukraine."
"I wish to stress that nothing can justify genocide, not even an attempt to gain freedom and sovereignty for one's own nation."
"Cross-border cooperation to combat terrorism and cross-border crime (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Bárbara Dührkop Dührkop, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to the adoption of a Council Decision on the implementation of Decision 2007/.../JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime (11563/2007 - C6-0409/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, the report which we have produced for debate and approval today embodies a 2005 initiative, in which the seven Member States decided to step up cross-border cooperation in all areas relating to terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration."
"The German Presidency proposed incorporating part of this agreement in the Community acquis by means of a framework decision, that is to say under the third pillar, on the lines of what was done with the Schengen Agreement, leaving aside, however, the matter of illegal immigration which, according to the Tampere mandate, should come under the third pillar."
"It is therefore regrettable that clear Community powers were not included in the international treaty, since this not only creates judicial confusion, but leaves us with two legal frameworks of reference."
"The first was negotiated in a less than transparent manner."
"National parliaments were not consulted, nor was the European Parliament."
"We were only consulted at the last minute, in haste and in a non-binding manner as the instrument was about to be incorporated into the Community acquis."
"The report of our unfortunate fellow Member Fausto Correia sets out the position of the European Parliament on this matter."
"Today we are pleased to be able to say that the Council consultation is being presented on the basis of the codecision procedure."
"This is a consultation which does not confine itself to the agreement itself but includes its preamble and annex, which we appreciate, because, although they are technical, they contain provisions which are of great political significance."
"Many of them are designed specifically to ensure the protection of personal and sensitive data."
"However, we are sorry that the Council has still not approved the framework decision on the definition of data protection in order to lay down certain minimum rules."
"It is incongruous for the Council to prepare to adopt this decision rather than its own general law."
"Nor was the European Data Protection Supervisor consulted at any time."
"Briefly, the report provides for cooperation in terms of exchanging data on DNA, fingerprints, vehicle registration numbers and personal and non-personal data."
"The aim is to be able to compare the DNA profile of a person with the future databases of 27 national contact points."
"The report clearly indicates that common guarantees must be laid down for the protection of data and the right of defence of suspects and guilty parties."
"Only the non-coding parts of DNA, in other words the zones containing no genetic expression, may be transferred."
"All shared information must indicate the stage of the proceedings affecting the person concerned and the database from which the information was obtained."
"The European Parliament must be consulted again if the Council wishes to alter the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany in any way and particularly regarding the number of loci needed to make accurate comparisons."
"I would also remind the Council that the Conference of Representatives of the Governments of the Member States called for the possibility of incorporating this framework decision in the new Lisbon Treaty system, in order to allow recourse to the Court of Justice."
"I would also like to point out that, in the paragraph relating to officers and the possibility of cross-border cooperation, I do not agree with the part approved in committee, which gives officers powers to detain and to take statements in a Member State other than their own."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, bilateral cross-border cooperation has always existed but this decision will be a first in terms of Europe-wide cooperation."
"It is true that there is concern, serious concern, that, despite good intentions, the proliferation of networks may lead to abuse and possibly to serious mistakes."
"Protecting the innocent is without doubt the foremost concern of everyone and of our House in particular, given that it represents all our citizens."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the political agreement reached in the Council on 13 June 2007 on the first part of the legislative package aimed at transposing the Prüm Treaty into European law, Germany has submitted the initiative that we are about to discuss, namely the implementation of the decision which is the subject matter of the first part and its annex."
"Mrs Dührkop, the Commission has consistently supported the integration of the Prüm Treaty into the European Union."
"This is an instrument of major importance that will significantly strengthen police cooperation between the Member States by enabling them to take more effective action to combat terrorism and cross-border crime, for example by facilitating the exchange of the DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data of wanted persons."
"The removal of checks on persons at the internal borders of the EU, between the signatory countries of the Schengen Agreement, is a major step forward in the process of European integration."
"However, it is our duty to ensure that this area of free movement is also, of course, an area of security and justice."
"Improving police cooperation between the Member States' authorities, while fully respecting fundamental rights and, in particular, data protection, is essential for guaranteeing greater security within the European Union for the benefit of our citizens."
"The draft decision that we are discussing today constitutes follow-up action required to ensure the full technical and operational implementation of the decision on which the Council reached political agreement in June 2007."
"This agreement aims to transpose the essential provisions of the Treaty of Prüm into the legal framework of the European Union."
"The Commission has also consistently supported the need to involve Parliament in the procedure for amending the annex to this instrument."
"In the Commission's view, the provisions on data protection laid down in the decision of June 2007, as well as in the draft currently being debated, will be supplemented by the provisions of the Framework Decision on data protection in the third pillar."
"They clearly need to be supplemented, as you have said."
"For its part, the Commission generally welcomes the amendments that you propose, Mrs Dührkop."
"However, as this is an initiative put forward by the Member States, Mr President, the Commission will submit its detailed position on the amendments during discussions in the Council."
"This is my response, and I would like to conclude by thanking your rapporteur once again for having been kind enough to highlight the means and conditions for the proper implementation of this decision."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are few issues on which the citizens of Europe broadly agree that Europe is making serious efforts on their behalf."
"What we are debating here today is a significant issue of that kind: cooperation among Member States in order successfully to combat cross-border crime and terrorism."
"I am very glad we managed to reach a consensus in committee too, thanks to the preparatory work and the very fair cooperation with the rapporteur."
"That means that while we may not agree on every single point, we are broadly in agreement and want to play our part in making headway in this matter."
"The Prüm Agreement process was very laborious and took a long time."
"We only advanced bit by bit."
"Yet it is a good thing that we now have European agreements on the exchange of data, that national databases are being linked up and that we can use those national databases to pursue and prevent crime."
"I would have liked to see more progress in certain areas of this whole project."
"That is why I am taking this opportunity not just to talk about what we have achieved to date but also to say this: of course this decision also includes a few points that may apply tomorrow and the day after."
"For instance, we want to use joint police forces more efficiently and quickly and we want police forces from one Member State that have specific skills to be able to operate in another Member State."
"Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has just pointed out that there are certain difficulties."
"Yet it is important to drive this process forward, to ensure that we have more European responsibilities here and carry out more joint actions."
"In the end we may find that a very good way to promote the European idea is by demonstrating to people that we are trying to resolve important issues in a manner they too consider positive."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I believe I am speaking on behalf of my group when I say that we had excellent cooperation with the rapporteur."
"We cooperated very closely, as Mr Reul has just said."
"Nonetheless, we have to ask why it is so urgent to take a decision, why it has to be taken now and, in particular, before the end of the year."
"We would have been very happy to see the Lisbon Treaty rules apply here, such as judicial review, as also proper participation in the sense of codecision with the European Parliament."
"As regards the data protection aspect that was addressed here, Prüm has its own data protection rules, and then there are the implementing rules and the treaty rules."
"Indeed Mrs Dührkop Dührkop also noted the need for a framework decision in the third pillar."
"If we take a careful look at the categories of data regulated by the Prüm Treaty, we see that it is more than necessary to have framework legislation on the matter."
"We must also ask why so-called special categories of data are included, such as data providing information on sexual orientation, health, political and union activities, and religious belief."
"That goes far beyond the basic data needed in relation to organised crime."
"There are restrictions on the use of that data yet it remains incredible that it can be used at all."
"In the case of DNA data, we strongly support the rapporteur's view that - if that data is necessary and if it can be exchanged - it must be clearly restricted and used only for the purpose for which it was intended."
"Furthermore, it must be made clear that Member States which do not have national DNA databases are not obliged to establish them."
"I want to finish by saying that it would be very sensible - as personal exchanges of views with police authorities have brought to light - if, instead of concentrating on legislative measures, we financed programmes to assist the exchange of personnel between police forces."
"That would be sure to improve cooperation in the Union."
"It is astonishing that the funding has not yet been clarified given that the decision is to be taken very soon."
"Before spending money, people should know how much is to be spent, before taking a decision people should know how much it costs."
"Mr President, the German Government's initiative and the report we are debating are not innocently technical, as they are being made out to be."
"They are about the technical and administrative conditions necessary for the swift and successful application of preventive data recording enacted by the Treaty of Prüm, which was incorporated into EU legislation a few months ago."
"DNA data, fingerprints, personal data and information of all kinds is gathered, processed and exchanged automatically in every possible detail, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, between the repressive mechanisms of the Member States and the EU."
"Every citizen and worker in the EU may be under preventive surveillance and recorded as data."
"The security forces act on the slightest suspicion that someone might at some point in the future commit offences or endanger public order and security."
"In other words, everyone is guilty until proven innocent."
"The report we are discussing takes things a step further in data recording legalisation, opening the door to the recording and exchange of data relating to political views, religious or philosophical convictions and party political or trade union membership."
"Why do you need all of this?"
"To tackle organised crime? That is a lie!"
"You want to record data on everyone in the world!"
"You want to ban and intimidate anyone who questions your policies!"
"For this reason, we, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, are voting against the report."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, since the 9/11 attacks if not before, the EU has concentrated its technical security measures almost entirely on combating terrorism."
"Now, it is certainly right actually for us not to make it easy for potential assassins to download bomb-making instructions from the Internet and of course closer cooperation among Member States is to be welcomed."
"Yet, in the fight against terrorism we cannot allow innocent citizens to become targets or awkward critics to be silenced."
"I believe there is a dangerous trend worldwide constantly to erode the basic liberties for which our forefathers fought so hard."
"We are running the risk of becoming a profoundly illiberal society, by passing on passenger data, by Internet surveillance."
"I hope we do not soon find that every nonconformist who attends a demonstration supports a referendum, or even dares to criticise the EU is branded a potential terrorist."
"Of course it is important to be vigilant - but not to the detriment of civil liberties."
"And of course we must not allow other areas, such as combating organised crime, to suffer as a result."
"We must not underestimate the dangers of ever-expanding parallel societies, migration-based violence and potential ethnic and cultural conflicts."
"Mr President, when talking about incitement to terrorism in the age of the internet and the age of new technologies we are talking about completely new challenges and completely new threats and, as my colleague has said, we must strike a very fine balance between infringing the civil liberties of various political organisations and combating threats to our security and the security of our citizens."
"In recent weeks, speakers from the Council of Europe, for example, have raised various concerns and asked us to adopt in full various recommendations presented by the Council of Europe."
"We must be selective as to what aspects of the Council of Europe's very valuable work we transfer to the European Parliament, because Parliament has its own, unique role to play in this matter."
"In dealing with the new threats posed by terrorism, the most difficult problem we face will be to actually define what incitement is, and whether justified criticism of governments could ever be considered to be incitement to terrorism."
"That was one of the arguments presented recently, at a meeting of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, by Mr Dick Marty from the Council of Europe."
"He seemed to have little faith in our democratic structures, suggesting that various articles could be misused by governments."
"I have more faith than him in our democratic procedures, and believe we will be able to handle this issue sensitively, but also with the prudence it demands of this institution."
"Mr President, there are 4.3 million individuals whose DNA is on the UK national DNA database and available to police."
"That is 7% of the UK population - at least five times higher, as a proportion, than in any other country."
"That figure includes 150 000 children under the age of 16, of whom 25 000 have never been charged with an offence."
"Britain's most senior police forensics expert has even suggested that children as young as five should go on the DNA database if they exhibit behaviour indicating they might be potential criminals in later life."
"This is taking predictive policing to a ridiculous level."
"My party believes this to be the realisation of Orwell's 'Big Brother' Britain."
"The DNA of innocent people should not be exchanged, and at the very minimum, in line with the advice of the European Data Protection Supervisor, there should be precise limitations on what data can be exchanged and a health warning in that exchange if the person has no criminal record."
"(PT) Mr President, Vice-President Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, today we are debating a second decision to establish rules necessary for the implementation of another initiative that already has the political agreement of the Council, but has not yet even been adopted."
"I am aware that there has been a series of initiatives to combat terrorism and cross-border crime in order to strengthen security and vigilance, but I regret that the same attention has not been paid to increasing the protection of fundamental rights."
"The European Union still has no standard set of procedural safeguards and no adequate third pillar legal instrument on data protection, as Vice-President Barrot has just recognised in his speech."
"I ask you, Commissioner, to help us explain to the Council that this situation is unacceptable, especially if we take into account that most of the measures to combat terrorism and promote police cooperation have involved the collection and exchange of personal data."
"This latest initiative is yet another example and it is all the more serious as it involves the collection, storage and sharing of DNA data and fingerprints, etc. The data protection standards set out in Chapter VI of the Prüm initiative, which ensure more specific guarantees, are not self-sufficient and, in order to function correctly, they need a complete and general framework, which can only be effectively guaranteed through the framework decision on third pillar data protection."
"It was with great satisfaction that we approved this initiative, in which essential aspects of cooperation in the Prüm initiative will be transposed into the Union framework. However, we cannot leave the job half done."
"It is also essential to ensure the existence of a clear and effective judicial framework for data protection."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, in my opinion, Mr Coelho has just provided a very clear and objective picture of the situation."
"The proposal initially put forward by the Commission was certainly more ambitious, and we regret, in particular, the decision's more limited scope."
"However, the purpose of the decision is to lay the foundations required to ensure a minimum level of protection in the third pillar."
"Without the adoption of such a decision, we would have no general rule applicable in the third pillar, which would be even worse."
"We hope that this decision will be adopted as soon as possible, once Parliament has delivered its opinion on the new text that the Council has submitted to Parliament for the second time."
"As I said earlier, when thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Dührkop, once again, clearly, in the Commission's view, the provisions on data protection will be supplemented by the provisions of the Framework Decision on data protection in the third pillar."
"With these closing remarks, Mr President, I should like to thank all of the speakers for their contributions to this debate."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank all those fellow Members with whom it has been a pleasure to work on this report."
"I will not answer you individually, but in general."
"All of us are particularly concerned about the need to strike a balance between combating terrorism and crime and, at the same time, rigorously protecting private and public rights because no one may be stripped of his civil rights for the sake of the fight against terrorism."
"Such a balance is sometimes difficult to achieve, but it is up to us democrats to be constantly on the lookout for any abuse in this area."
"Secondly, reference has been made to police cooperation: this is vital."
"I live in a region where terrorism exists."
"I have police protection myself, and when I have to go to France, I have to ask my local police to send a form to Madrid, who will then ask France for permission to cross the border with a gun, and that takes a week."
"I realise that we ought to have a swifter, less bureaucratic method, so perhaps there could be a European police permit."
"I think, I believe that European police forces have more or less the same training."
"Furthermore, Mr Alvaro, as Sarah Ludford and Mr Coelho also mentioned, we urgently need the Framework Decision, and this is a matter which we want to put to the Council."
"We need minimum standards of data protection."
"This is a fair demand on the part of all citizens."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 22 April 2008."
"in writing. - Today we are fortunate that law enforcement agencies have tools at their disposal such as DNA data, automated fingerprint identification and vehicle registration data."
"I am all in favour of having a common database of all the necessary tools to fight terrorism and cross-border crime."
"It is a fact that data protection is essential but in the fight against terrorism and international crime it is secondary."
"Not only am I in favour of sharing databases but I am also in favour of having compulsory national databases."
"The majority of European citizens and residents are law abiding and should not fear having their data, be it DNA and fingerprinting, available on a common European database."
"Malta is a neutral state but where terror is concerned we are not neutral."
"The targeting of innocent civilians can never be justified."
"Terror is one of the most hideous crimes at par with genocide and war crimes."
"At present the norm is that terrorists are tried in national courts."
"The time has come to consider an international judicial structure specifically for trying terrorists."
"in writing. - (FI) There needs to be greater cooperation between the border control authorities, customs, the police and the security authorities to improve the safety of Europeans."
"The purpose of the Prüm Convention is to deepen cooperation between EU countries to counter terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal immigration."
"The Prüm Convention will strengthen security within Europe."
"A smooth flow of the exchange of information between the security authorities, especially border control authorities, will be a key priority."
"There must be weighty reasons for information exchange between the EU countries."
"Clearly, breaking the law is a good reason for this as is sufficient evidence of intended wrongdoing."
"Information exchange needs to respect the protection of law-abiding European individuals so that abuses of human rights do not take place as a result of breaches of privacy."
"The purpose of cooperation in matters of security is to keep Europe a safe place to live in and to protect law-abiding citizens."
"Cooperation in matters of security must protect Europeans against criminals in order to make our everyday lives as safe as possible and to enable our children to live without fear."
"Cost of obtaining a visa for Belarusian and Ukrainian citizens (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the cost of obtaining a visa for Belarusian and Ukrainian citizens"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the questions that you have asked me on the European visa rules applicable to Ukraine and Belarus."
"Firstly, in the case of Ukraine, the Agreement on readmission and the Agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas, both of which entered into force at the beginning of 2008, represent an important milestone in relations between the European Union and Ukraine."
"On the one hand, they will promote people-to-people contacts, which in turn will help improve mutual understanding and strengthen relations in all areas, and, on the other, they will commit both sides, the European Union and Ukraine, to close cooperation to combat illegal immigration."
"The first priority is to ensure the speedy, operational and harmonised implementation of the Agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas to Ukrainian citizens."
"To ensure that this Agreement is properly and uniformly applied, draft guidelines have been drawn up and approved by the Member States and the Ukrainian authorities."
"These guidelines should be finalised and adopted in the near future by the Joint Committee established by the Agreement."
"As stated in the preamble to the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on the facilitation of the issuance of visas, the introduction of a visa-free travel regime for the citizens of Ukraine is recognised only as a long-term prospect."
"The process that will lead to the introduction of such a regime depends mainly on the satisfactory implementation of the Agreement on readmission and of the Agreement on the facilitation of issuance of visas."
"I should like to emphasise that the enlargement of the Schengen area in no way affects the arrangements for carrying out checks at the borders between Ukraine and those Member States which became part of the Schengen area on 21 December 2007."
"Those Member States have been applying the Schengen rules on external border checks since their accession, and since September 2007 they also carry out checks on persons in the Schengen Information System - SIS."
"However, to make travel easier for Ukrainian citizens living in the border area, agreements on local border traffic have been signed between Hungary and Ukraine, and between Ukraine and Poland."
"Moreover, the Commission has called for amendments to the agreement between Ukraine and Hungary with regard to the demarcation of the border area in order to bring this agreement into line with Community rules; this is also the case for the agreement between Ukraine and Poland."
"That is all I have to say about travel for Ukrainian citizens living in the border area."
"The situation for visas, on the other hand, is different."
"Prior to 21 December 2007 those Member States that did not yet fully apply the Schengen acquis were not bound by the Schengen provisions on visa fees."
"These Member States could therefore waive this fee for all Ukrainian citizens."
"However, this is now no longer possible."
"Nevertheless, the standard visa fee of EUR 60 does not apply to Ukrainian visa applicants."
"As confirmed by the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine that entered into force on 1 January 2008, the fee for processing visa applications of Ukrainian citizens will remain at EUR 35."
"In addition, the Agreement exempts broad categories of Ukrainian visa applicants from the visa fee, which means that more than 50%, I repeat, more than 50% of Ukrainian nationals now wishing to travel to Schengen countries benefit from a full waiving of the visa fee."
"I should now like to turn to Belarus."
"In its Communication on strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy, dated 4 December 2006, the Commission emphasised the importance of facilitating the issuance of visas for relations with the countries covered by the Neighbourhood Policy."
"The Commission restated the European Union's willingness to develop Action Plans with neighbouring countries and to enter into negotiations with them in order to facilitate the issuance of visas and the granting of permission for readmission."
"Belarus is one of the countries covered by the Neighbourhood Policy, but it has to be said that no Action Plan has been developed with this country yet owing to its overall political situation."
"This is why there are no plans to open discussions on the possible facilitation of the issuance of visas and on readmission with Belarus at this stage."
"Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise that the existing acquis on the issuance of short-term visas provides for exemption from visa fees for some categories of persons, such as children under the age of six, students and researchers."
"In addition, under the current rules, the Member States may, at any time, cancel or reduce the visa fee in justifiable individual cases, for example for humanitarian reasons, to protect cultural interests or on foreign policy grounds."
"Furthermore, the neighbouring Member States - Poland, Latvia and Lithuania in particular - always have the possibility of negotiating local border traffic agreements with Belarus."
"This would be a means of facilitating border crossing and the movement of border residents between Belarus and its neighbouring countries, whilst promoting contacts between local communities."
"Border residents holding a special local border traffic permit would be exempt from the visa requirement."
"Poland and Belarus have already entered into negotiations to that end."
"This concludes what I wanted to say, whilst emphasising the pertinence of the questions that you have asked and bringing you up to date with the most recent developments in this matter."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for coming and presenting the latest position of the Commission on visa issues for the Ukraine and Belarus."
"A month ago, a delegation which comprised members of most of the mainstream opposition in Belarus visited Strasbourg at the invitation of the PPE-DE Group to discuss how the political situation is developing in that country, but also during that visit colleagues may have seen their appeals to this Parliament to support their efforts to reduce the visa fees they are currently paying, which are indeed prohibitive for the majority of Belarus citizens."
"If we really want to encourage Belarus to pick a pro-European route in future - which we sincerely hope will be the case - the strongest arguments we have are those which the Belarus citizens can see with their own eyes."
"It is very difficult for them, in the regime in which they live, to have a real insight into what freedom and democracy, human rights and rule of law really mean."
"It is difficult to promote a civil society."
"It is difficult to show them that Europe is open and friendly and supports their move towards a full democracy."
"The best way we can do that is to allow those citizens access into Europe not at rates which will frighten or prohibit entry by most citizens."
"Commissioner, you very rightly said that specific groups are excluded, and that is indeed children, and people with family contacts; it is people who are visiting the European Union for cultural or scientific or educational reasons, and I would encourage individual member countries to make use of that legal provision to let those people actually make use of those facilities."
"But it is very sad that Serbia and Russia are treated on better terms than Belarus's citizens."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, first I want to thank the Commissioner for the very precise information, as ever, he has provided on this issue."
"I myself have experienced the problems of visas and visa restrictions in the Balkans and I still come across them today, although things have eased up a little."
"Let us take Serbia for instance, since it has already been mentioned."
"In spite of the present simplifications, in the context of Yugoslavia - i.e. a communist regime - it had far more contact with the West, with the European countries, in the past than it has now, which means there is something wrong with the whole system."
"We really do need fundamental changes."
"The Commissioner rightly pointed out that in Ukraine more than half of all applicants enjoy exemptions of one kind or another."
"I wonder what kind of system exempts 50% or more."
"I admit, however, that this is not his fault."
"Let me now turn to Belarus."
"I was happy to support the proposal from Mrs Grabowska and Mr Paleckis because I find it very difficult to accept that the citizens of that country should suffer twice over because of a bad regime: not just under the regime but also because we are not formulating any plan of action in face of that bad regime."
"Sometimes we have to choose to act more unilaterally and decide on our own initiative to do something specifically to help those who receive no help from their own regime or government."
"The Commissioner indicated that to some extent that is already the case."
"Yet more needs to be done and we need to conduct a more aggressive policy toward Belarus."
"For instance, I would be interested to know - and perhaps the Commissioner can answer me at a later date - which countries grant which exemptions."
"Which European Union countries are particularly helpful and which are perhaps less so?"
"Surely it is important to adopt a European Union stance and if some countries take a liberal approach it would be a disaster for others to be very restrictive."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council - given that we know that they bear the main responsibility - to work together with us to ensure that we can offer the citizens and all concerned in Belarus more advantages than we have done - laboriously - in the past."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (HU) Mr President, Ukraine and Belarus have a key role to play in the Eastern dimension of our Neighbourhood policy."
"With Ukraine the aim is democracy, a market economy, consolidation of the orientation towards Europe while with Belarus the aim is the democratisation of the country."
"Relaxation of travel requirements is a flexible and valuable tool for this."
"Since 1 January citizens of Ukraine have benefited from a simplified visa regime, though the majority of them feel that the position today is harder than it was before, since getting into their major target countries, Poland, Hungary and Lithuania, is now more difficult than it was previously."
"This is seen as a backward step, since the EUR 35 visa fee is a large sum of money for them, and the administrative burden and procedures are extremely complicated."
"So we have to show that for Ukraine the immediate aim, the granting of visa-free travel, will happen very soon, and until we can do this, the granting of visas without a fee will have an impact on an even greater number of people, as well the relaxation of the administrative burden."
"As for Belarus, we have to make it clear that Europe does not have a problem with the people of Belarus but with its oppressive regime."
"We would wish its citizens to be able to travel more easily and so we have to relax the EUR 60 visa fee, a huge amount of money, as in Belarus it is equivalent to half the average monthly wage, and we also have to reduce the administrative burden, as the complicated regulations are difficult to comply with."
"In this way we can reach a position where the citizens of Ukraine and Belarus feel that they are close to Europe. Thank you."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Union will not guarantee the security of its Eastern border by ignoring the interests of Belarusians and Ukrainians."
"We should support visits to the Union by the widest possible groups of people specifically from Ukraine and Belarus, and at the same time isolating the Lukashenka regime."
"Democratic processes and the changes in the mentality of our Eastern neighbours, for example as far as their perceptions of NATO in Ukraine are concerned, will take place more quickly thanks to personal experiences of visits in the European Union countries."
"At the moment Belarusians must pay EUR 60 for a visa."
"This is equivalent of one third of average salary and precludes most of the society from visiting."
"This situation suits the Lukashenka regime, since the more contacts with Western Europe are restricted, the easier it will be to control Belarusian society."
"The visa requirement isolates the Belarusian youth and those people who have opposition sympathies."
"The West should want to maintain contacts with these social groups."
"Expensive visa charges lead only to an increase in the activity of the visa mafia and to other pathologies on the borders."
"Such barriers also cause tangible losses to tourism in Poland."
"Skiers from Ukraine and Belarus have visited Polish mountains in large numbers in recent years."
"They have tended to arrive in early January, when the Orthodox Christmas begins."
"By now Polish skiing resorts are empty."
"Ladies and gentlemen, especially now, when at the NATO summit in Bucharest Vladimir Putin threatened to cause the break-up of Ukraine and stated that, and I quote, 'Ukraine is not even a state, and one part of its territory is Eastern Europe and another - a large one - was gifted to it by Russia', a clear signal is needed that the European Union will not tolerate such threats against its nearest neighbour in international politics."
"I appeal for the fastest possible commencement of a dialogue on specific actions so that the Ukrainians will not require EU visas."
"I wish to state clearly that a real vision of a contemporary and safe Europe is not possible without Ukraine."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, official EU policy towards Belarus is known as a policy of 'differentiation': on the one hand it is critical of the dictator Lukashenko while, on the other, it seeks to encourage and facilitate dialogue with the people."
"But charging EUR 60 - a third of a month's salary in Belarus - for a visa flies in the face of that policy."
"As a result, ordinary people in Belarus regard EU policy towards them as a policy of empty words!"
"This issue has completely obscured our Schengen policy and is actually undermining the credibility of EU foreign policy."
"We cannot allow such a situation to continue."
"The democracy that we want to see developing in Belarus can come into being only if we make it easier for people from Belarus to see for themselves how democracy works in our countries."
"Any other approach would simply play into Lukashenko's hands."
"So we need to make a change and the Council told us, in its answer, that the reason why no change has yet been made is that the Commission has not tabled the necessary proposal."
"So, please, get to work!"
"Put a proposal before the Council that will make it easier - in the interests of promoting democracy in Belarus - for people there to obtain visas."
"(LT) Madam President, whatever has been said about the cost of visas for Belarusians and Ukrainians, there is no doubt that urgent decisions should be taken on this issue and that they should be taken by the European Union."
"On the subject of visas, the European Union has signed a visa facilitation agreement with Ukraine, as well as with Russia, Moldova and the Western Balkan states."
"However, negotiations on the agreement with Belarus have not even begun, because Alexander Lukashenko is not interested in offering Belarusian citizens the possibility of seeing the standard of life in the free world, especially if they find it to be much higher than that in Belarus."
"The issue of the cost of visas remains important not only for Belarus, but for Ukraine too."
"The fact that Ukrainian citizens have to pay EUR 35 for a Schengen visa does not solve the problem, because only certain small groups of Ukrainian citizens qualify for the visa facilitation regime."
"The case of Belarus is even more eloquent - Belarusians have to pay more for a Schengen visa - that is, they have to pay the price for Lukashenko's dictate."
"Is the visa regime adequate in view of the situation on the EU's Eastern border?"
"I do not think so."
"According to statistics, Poland alone issues about 600 000 visas to Ukrainian citizens each year; as a comparison, the number of visas issued by all the Schengen countries in the same period is only 300 000."
"Prior to joining the Schengen area, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland maintained very low visa prices for Belarusian citizens: Lithuania and Poland charged only EUR 5 and Latvia issued visas free of charge."
"Poland, Lithuania and Latvia used to issue 400 000 visas to Belarusians, i.e. three times more than the number issued by the old Schengen countries."
"Would you say it is a good thing that only 26% of Belarusian citizens have ever visited an EU country, and that 60% of Belarusians have never seen a foreign person during the last three years?"
"Of course not."
"We, the European Union, must find an efficient way to solve this issue, as we know from our own experience that it is better to see the EU once than to hear about it a hundred times."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, as a co-author of a question on the cost of visas for Belarus I wish to thank you for today's explanations and to draw your attention to several additional matters."
"The point is that Belarus is not only a close neighbour of the EU."
"It is also the closest one of my country, Poland, hence my concern and my intervention on behalf of the interests of those who live in that country."
"After Schengen enlargement you said that the cost of visas for Belarusians went up."
"In reality the cost went up by a factor of 12, from EUR 5 to 60."
"In Belarus EUR 60 is the monthly salary of a medical doctor under training."
"EUR 60 for many Belarusians is a real barrier preventing them from obtaining a visa and from visiting EU neighbours."
"We can already see that after the visa price rise there has been a visible and drastic fall in the numbers of Belarusian citizens travelling to the EU."
"This happened at a time when the EU wishes to establish direct contact with its citizens and when the policy of good neighbourliness is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty."
"It is therefore a painful paradox for this country, even if it is ruled undemocratically."
"Please believe me that the decision to increase visa fees is an excellent present for the Lukashenka regime which discounts this politically."
"The regime says to Belarusians: you see?"
"They have introduced high, prohibitive fees."
"Nobody is waiting for you in Europe, nobody wants you there."
"This needs to be changed."
"I value the fact that the Commissioner mentioned Poland as the country which intends to press for lower visa fees for Belarusians."
"However this is not a task for Poland, Lithuania and individual countries."
"It is a task for the entire EU."
"Should we be unable to solve this, how are we to build a common foreign policy within the EU?"
"I therefore appeal to the Commission to take all the steps necessary to lower visa fees for Belarusians."
"(PL) As early as May 2005 Ukraine withdrew the requirement to obtain visas for citizens of the European Union."
"However the EU needed as long as three years to take any position on this."
"I want to say that the final EU reaction was far from clear."
"On the one hand, early this year visas became easier to obtain, certain procedures were simplified and visa fees were waived, but only for selected groups of citizens."
"For most Ukrainians the European Union appears to be an impregnable fortress, opening its doors only for those who can cope patiently with the long and very expensive struggle at consulates of Schengen countries."
"For many Ukrainians visas are too expensive."
"The institutions involved in the visa issue process generally charge twice or even three times more than the set maximum fee."
"Secondly, the time required for a visa to be issued at many consulates is unpredictable and very long."
"Thirdly, many consulates require additional documents, not mentioned in the agreement."
"Even diplomatic passport holders may have problems at border crossings."
"The necessary final aim for Ukraine is a clear road map attempting to introduce bilateral visa-free travel, albeit with difficult preconditions, as was the case with Serbia."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Europe without borders, the European Union within Schengen, cannot mean the creation of a new wall between the EU and Eastern Europe."
"European dreams of a single borderless Europe have materialised within the EU."
"However, what is happening now on the border between the EU and Ukraine and Belarus is a political scandal of sorts for my generation - the Solidarity generation in Poland, which fought for the unity of Europe."
"Today the problems of reaching the European Union for the Ukrainians and Belarusians must be resolved as soon as possible."
"Commissioner, I appeal to you!"
"We, Europeans in the rich, democratic countries, must do everything we can today so that the EU is open for the civil societies of Belarus and Ukraine."
"(SK) Mr President, the fact that you are chairing today's debate is highly symbolic and I thank you for that."
"In my speeches I mention at every opportunity the request by the leaders of civil society in Ukraine and in the EU to the Member States and EU institutions, and to the Ukrainian Government and Supreme Council, for Europe to give greater consideration to the Ukraine-EU visa issue."
"As Ukraine is one of the European Union's strategic partners, I welcome today's debate and the information the Commissioner has provided."
"While I accept that this is a very demanding process, I also think that it is vital to find a solution."
"Visa issue involving Belarusian citizens were also examined during Belarus Week in the European Parliament at meetings with Alexander Milinkevich, the winner of the Sakharov Prize."
"It is our duty to help the people who are the hapless victims of Lukashenko's regime."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to adopt as quickly as possible a solution to simplify the visa regime: that will send a positive and constructive signal to the pro-European and pro-democratic forces in Ukraine and Belarus."
"(PL) Mr President, the youth of Belarus is often punished by the withdrawal of the right to education for holding beliefs not liked by the authorities."
"Poland provides higher education places for many of these young people."
"We must not waste this by imposing an economic blockade on such young people who want to enter our country to study."
"This economic blockade should be dismantled and the visa fees should be lowered."
"Before I hand over to the Commissioner - and we have a bit of time - I wish to add something."
"As a frequent traveller to Ukraine I wish to say that a crucial issue in the visa problem, in the entire visa regime, is explaining to the societies of Ukraine and Belarus whether what they have to go through today is a transitional stage."
"This applies to prices and to procedures."
"The prices are prohibitive and the procedures humiliating."
"These people queue for long hours, for dozens of hours."
"Is this transitional or permanent?"
"The Ukrainians often say that a Schengen wall has been erected, that what has been introduced and greeted with joy by everybody, by us Poles, by the French, for a long time now by the Germans, is in reality just a process of natural isolation, that the queue in front of a consulate, the refusal, the price - all that is merely a signal to their societies, a signal received very negatively in the context of all the aspirations we speak so much about in this Chamber and elsewhere."
"The debate is closed."
"Please forgive me that I have broken the golden rule, that the President does not interfere in such matters, but I simply could not remain silent on this issue."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I have listened carefully to what you have just said, and it supports a great many speakers who have emphasised the need to facilitate access to the European Union for the citizens of our neighbouring countries."
"I believe that many have spoken with a great deal of common sense!"
"The more opportunities there are for people-to-people exchanges, the more likely it is that citizens will influence their own country's move towards democracy and commitment to European values."
"Nevertheless, I must first reply on the subject of Belarus."
"I have explained why, so far, there have been no plans to enter into negotiations on an agreement on visa facilitation."
"The political situation may well change, and I should like to add that the European Union is making every effort to make its presence felt in the country, as, a few days ago, a European Commission office was set up in Belarus."
"At all events, as I have already said, Belarusian citizens already have the opportunity to travel within the European Union under existing EU legislation."
"However, I have listened carefully to all sides of the argument, and I cannot say more than I have already said regarding Belarus."
"As far as Ukraine is concerned, I should like to say that the situation is much more positive."
"The Agreement on visa fees for Ukrainian citizens stipulates that the Schengen states will charge EUR 35 for processing visa applications of Ukrainian citizens, and not EUR 60, which is considered to be the average cost of a visa."
"Therefore, efforts have already been made."
"I also mentioned that there are some categories of Ukrainian citizens who could benefit from a full waiver of the visa fee."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, I am acutely aware of what you have just said."
"The price is an issue, but, occasionally, so is the way in which these formalities have to be completed: very lengthy procedures that give these citizens the impression that the European Union is a long way off."
"I have to tell you that, at present, my attention is drawn to the problems faced in particular by the citizens of the Western Balkan States."
"I am trying to determine ways in which we can also make these procedures easier."
"I believe that, if we succeed, we will probably also do so in the case of countries such as Ukraine."
"That concludes, Mr President, what I wanted to say to Parliament, whilst being fully aware that all the Members' remarks are justifiable to some extent, but that, as things stand, some progress has already been made."
"It is true that a lot more remains to be done, but I also feel that each Member State should endeavour to take advantage of the opportunities that are already available."
"I, for one, shall be making every effort to do so."
"The debate is closed."
"Organ donation and transplantation: Policy actions at EU level (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Adamos Adamou, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on organ donation and transplantation: Policy actions at EU level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the European Commission for its communication and the excellent cooperation we have had together."
"I should also like to thank all my colleagues, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, for the very difficult work we have done together to reach the compromise amendments which have been unanimously adopted."
"The main issues the Commission deals with in its communication and which I have been dealing with as rapporteur are: transplant risks and safety, for instance the transmission of diseases, the organ shortage and illegal organ trafficking."
"Permit me to talk about each of these in turn."
"With regard to quality and safety, when organs are used in therapy diseases risk being transmitted to the recipient."
"Donor testing is therefore important to minimise the risks to the recipient."
"Donors must be screened to establish whether or not there is a risk of any disease being transmitted."
"To establish a standard of donor safety, a minimum set of examinations should be performed."
"We must point out, however, that there is no consensus today between the Member States on these tests."
"The severe shortage of organ donors remains the main challenge facing Member States in organ transplantation."
"Growing waiting lists are a serious problem."
"The establishment of an efficient system to identify those who might become organ donors on their death, provided, of course, that all the mandatory consent requirements in Member States have been met, is thus a key element in fighting organ shortage."
"Another important option to increase the number of donors is the possible promotion of altruistic donations from living people."
"Careful consideration is also required of those potential donors who would not normally be considered ideal candidates, known of course, as expanded donors. For example a transplant could be allowed from one HIV-positive patient to other."
"Now, with regard to trafficking in organs, Commissioner, everyone knows that organ trafficking takes place."
"We all know that rich tourists from the West exploit the economic needs of people from the poorest countries."
"We have all heard that there are price lists of organs, that there is a black market in organs, particularly in countries of the Far East, such as India, Pakistan and China, and that these things are even happening in the enlarged Europe."
"I therefore endorse Amendment 7 to paragraph 57 by my fellow Members Mrs Brepoels, Mr Liese and Mr Bowis, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and it is important to improve the control of cases of organ trafficking so that we may, finally, draw the necessary conclusions."
"At the same time, I would like to stress that altruism must constitute the main element of organ donation and transplantation."
"The economic terminology used in the Commission's communication is therefore not adequate, in particular from the viewpoint of the principle of non-commercialisation of the human body."
"This is also the reason why I could not support Amendment 2 to paragraph 38 by Mr Martin and Mr Matsakis."
"Of course, following my detailed talks with Mr Matsakis, he - as he will explain to you himself - intends to withdraw it and will submit another oral amendment, tomorrow, which I support."
"I consider, however, as I have said before, that organs should not be treated as a commodity of the internal market and, consequently, I would not agree with the removal of this addition."
"Besides, the principle of non-commercialisation of the human body is expressly stated in Article 3(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not have any more time because the four minutes are up."
"I intend to continue in my conclusion, when I speak again following your remarks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first congratulate Mr Adamou on the excellent report he has prepared on organ donation and transplantation."
"I am particularly pleased that the report supports the Commission's view that action on the donation and transplantation of organs must focus on: firstly, improving the quality and safety of organs; secondly, increasing the availability of organs; and thirdly, making transplants safe."
"Ensuring high quality and safety standards in human organs is a benefit to everyone."
"We know that a number of organs are exchanged between EU Member States."
"At present, there is a lack of common quality and safety standards in the procurement of human organs and, therefore, meeting this need is very important."
"It provides not only a comparable safety standard to apply across the EU, but also leads to a feeling of security and solidarity in the transplantation system."
"The Commission plans to propose a legislative framework on the basic safety and quality principles in relation to the donation and procurement of human organs."
"These requirements will be broad and flexible, to maximise the number of transplantations taking place."
"After all, this is all about saving lives."
"We must keep uppermost in our minds the fact that there are 50 000 people on organ waiting lists across Europe at this point."
"Increasing organ availability requires raising public awareness of the issue."
"Citizens need to know that transplantation systems are safe and reliable. Otherwise they will not consent to donation."
"We already have some good examples in Member States where the addition of transplant coordinators, for example, has had a positive impact on donation rates."
"The Commission intends to propose an action plan with 10 priority actions to meet the challenges of organ donation and transplantation in the EU."
"The Commission recognises the importance of fighting organ trafficking as reflected in the communication on organ donation and transplantation."
"I also noted Dr Adamou's comments and will seriously consider them."
"His report makes it clear that we should look very carefully at how we intend to respond to the menace of organ trafficking in the EU."
"The Commission will monitor the situation in collaboration with our international partners, the Council of Europe and the World Health Organisation."
"We shall also support Interpol in order to continue with the monitoring of this problem."
"Moreover, I believe that by increasing organ availability in the European Union, we shall indirectly fight transplant tourism and trafficking of organs."
"In addition, organ trafficking will be included in this year's Commission report on an EU action plan on trafficking in human beings."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Mr President, organ donation and transplantation is a sensitive and important issue, where good legislation, together with good practice, might save thousands of human lives on a yearly basis."
"Issues on the fragile line between life and death are really sensitive."
"It is hard to help with legislation, but it is easy to harm."
"That is why it is profoundly important to respect good practices in the Member States."
"On the other hand, it is vitally necessary to discover all those practices which cause lack of trust and transparency in managing waiting lists or lead to scandalous cases of misused loopholes in legislation."
"I would like to point out three topics in the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"First, living donors are mainly unrelated."
"In this regard, legal procedures should minimise the possibility of illicit organ selling."
"The question of reimbursement of the social costs of donors is still awaiting a suitable solution."
"Secondly, in those cases where international cooperation is included in the transplantation process, legislation should ensure rules as clear as those within Member States."
"Transplantation tourism raises new questions, as the Commissioner mentioned."
"How should we handle such cases?"
"Thirdly, international cooperation in detecting cases of organ trafficking should be more organised and more serious, because hidden trafficking and its consequences can destroy the hopes of thousands of patients waiting for life-saving organs."
"On the other hand, European legislation on trafficking in human beings should also include organ selling and trafficking, even if it is still hidden but becoming an increasing global problem."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs and thank them for good cooperation."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, organ transplants do indeed save human lives in Europe every day."
"Sadly, a shortage of donors means that thousands of Europeans die every year whilst still on the waiting list."
"The challenge is how to increase donor numbers safely."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats I am very happy today to see Parliament wholeheartedly endorsing the Commission's initiative and acknowledging that Europe can play an essential role here."
"Organ donation and transplantation is a highly complex and emotive subject, as other speakers have said, and views on it vary widely in the Member States."
"Whilst working on the report I myself talked to quite a few doctors, patients and organisations."
"The hearing we held and the study visit to Spain also provided us with interesting insights, and I must thank the rapporteur very sincerely today for having incorporated all our contributions into his report."
"Four points."
"One, we must above all take care to ensure that the directive on quality and safety, put forward by the Commission, is sufficiently flexible and does not create additional administrative burdens or even a decrease in the number of organs available."
"In our view it must be the doctor who ultimately decides on quality and safety."
"To guarantee quality and safety we also ask that Member States monitor and evaluate post-transplantation and post-donation results."
"Since data comparability between Member States is very important here, we might perhaps think about having a common methodology for analysing the data."
"Two, we think the most essential factor in recruiting more donors, even more important than legislation, is the way in which the donation system is organised."
"We would thus like to see hospitals deploying more staff to identify potential donors, but also to counsel and assist the next of kin."
"In countries that use transplant coordinators of this kind, the number of donors rises."
"Three, this also demonstrates how crucially important it is to exchange good practice among Member States."
"The European Union can easily foster this."
"It is also important that hospitals publicise the positive results of transplantation and be proactive in their dealings with the media."
"Four, we think it is very important to consider living donors as well as post-mortem donors. And we would like to see living donors not being discriminated again, by insurance companies for example."
"Lastly, organ donation must remain a strictly non-commercial, altruistic and voluntary process."
"Any payments made must in our view be only for the expense and inconvenience of donating."
"The Commission, together with Member States, must be far more proactive in countering the sale and trafficking of organs and transplant tourism."
"Traceability is very important here and Europol too must monitor things better and identify cases of organ selling and/or trafficking."
"I am certain that Parliament, through this report, is sending out a very balanced and firm signal, and I urge the House to vote in favour of the report tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I look forward to the forthcoming proposal for a directive from the Commission which will establish quality and safety standards for the donation and procurement of organs throughout the European Union."
"In the interests of transparency in this process, I would like to say that as Socialists we support the measures aimed at protecting donors and ensuring that organ donation is made altruistically and voluntarily, ruling out any payment other than strict compensation for the expense and inconvenience involved in making the donation."
"The forthcoming legislative framework should not create an excessive administrative burden for the Member States, nor jeopardise the use of existing good practices."
"As for the practical process as such, I would like to point out that a few very stringent quality standards should not increase costs and in particular they should not reduce the number of organs available for transplant."
"Clearly, measures should not be adopted if they prevent organs from being transplanted, which would currently be regarded as acceptable, because what we are trying to do is to save human beings and ensure that human life is as comfortable as possible for the sick."
"Unfortunately, the excellent results obtained from transplants, in terms of increased lifespan and improved quality of life, have increased demand for this form of treatment."
"I come from Spain, a country which is a world leader in organ donation and transplantation."
"If we have managed to achieve this worthy ranking it is doubtless due to the existence of a National Transplant Organisation which coordinates all the teams of professionals in the relevant hospitals, each of which has its own transplant coordinator, a medical professional who coordinates the entire team and the process leading up to the donation."
"I hope that the proposed legislation from the European Commission will take this type of model into account since it is proving so successful."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise the desirability of including a reference to the need to involve citizens from third countries, with different cultures and religions, in the donation culture, by means of specific awareness measures, campaigns in their native language, cultural mediators etc., and of calling on States to combat trafficking wholeheartedly by adopting criminal liability measures against European citizens who pursue health tourism with a view to obtaining organs in third countries."
"It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur, and all the rapporteurs not mentioned individually, because it has been very easy working together and reaching agreement."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am trying to put myself in the position of the parents of a three-year-old girl diagnosed with a heart defect, for whom a three-year-old donor heart - not easy to find - was not available in her own country."
"In another European country one might well be available, but that country was not interested in cooperating with the rest of Europe."
"In that case I would be demanding action from Europe. And there is good reason why European action is needed."
"We currently have 400 000 people on a waiting list for organs in Europe and about ten of these will die every day because there is a shortage of donor organs."
"Regarding safety and quality criteria, the excellent Adamou report rightly warns against any further bureaucratic burden being imposed by legislation from Brussels."
"And the proposed legislation - I am glad that the Commissioner has just given it his blessing - certainly must not add to the red tape."
"If there is one sector that is vulnerable to red tape, it is this one."
"I was also very happy to hear you say just now that you want to open the way for as many transplants as possible and do not want to restrict the numbers."
"I think that is an important principle."
"We do need guarantees of closer cooperation between Member States."
"Cross-border cooperation means that the transplantation process is handled by hospitals and doctors who are governed by different legal systems."
"Last year, former Commissioner for Health Markos Kyprianou argued for the introduction of a European donor card. And Cyprus, as we know, Mr Adamou, Mrs Vassiliou, is a fount of wisdom."
"This card, whether or not it is combined with the European health insurance card, can ensure that organs which become available are used as efficiently as possible."
"Eurobarometer surveys show that 81% of Europeans back the use of an organ donor card, but only 12% of them actually carry one."
"The Adamou report calls for a voluntary European donor card and so I would like to take this opportunity to urge the Commissioner to put forward legislation by the end of the year to introduce a card of this kind to complement national cards."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Adamou for a very good report and excellent cooperation during the preparation of this report up to now."
"We need more organs - we are certainly in agreement over that. However, it is important that this takes place in a proper manner."
"Cooperation is good, and I personally believe that proper information is needed, better information, so that people will feel comfortable about being organ donors."
"As a result, people will know that everything will be done with respect, and this also applies to the next of kin, who are of course facing the most desperate situation of their lives, and people can also be secure in the knowledge that their relatives will be taken good care of."
"If this makes it is possible for them to discuss the matter with each other, then something good will come of it."
"However, under no circumstances should the need for organs lead to the commercialisation of the process."
"I believe that everyone is very pleased and in agreement that this issue is now to be addressed and we are going to tackle the trafficking that is taking place."
"It is unacceptable that we have not involved Europol sufficiently, because it is really a criminal matter."
"Even in places where it is not illegal, it is of course criminal that poor people are being persuaded to sell their kidneys in order to support their families."
"Finally, allow me to emphasise how many assurances we will have to give; we will need to be aware of this, as we will be subject to immense pressure."
"For example, I feel that a formulation such as people are dying 'as a result of the chronic shortage of organs' is poisonous."
"People are dying because they are ill."
"In addition, we will never have enough organs."
"There are some people who are fortunate enough to receive an organ and whose lives are saved as a result."
"Being able to achieve more cases like this is why we have to adopt this report."
"However, we will never be in a situation where we have enough organs."
"Even if we abolished all speed limits throughout Europe, it would not be enough."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to congratulate, as a physician and a Member of this House, my colleague Mr Adamos Adamou on his excellent work on this report."
"The issues of organ transplantation and donation can sometimes cause controversy and the reasons are evident: on the one hand, we have to take ethical issues into account, while on the other hand we should not allow medical progress to come to a stop, thereby restricting or hampering our ability to help people."
"I welcome the fact that the report is based on the pillars that I value."
"The first of these is the legal instruments: they have to guarantee that organ donation will continue to be voluntary rather than a commercial activity."
"It will be good to have standards but these standards must not affect implementation and options in the individual Member States."
"The second pillar relates to cooperation between the Member States, which is essential, as in many other areas."
"The third pillar relates to the fact that no measures can be taken without the cooperation of the citizens."
"I therefore welcome the measures to ensure greater public awareness and transparency."
"The common goal, which is evident in the report, is to eliminate illegal trafficking at all costs."
"Mr Adamou's report certainly paves the way for this."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the noble objectives of the Commission's Communication on organ donation and transplantation and policy actions at EU level, as well as Mr Adamou's report, which stresses that organ donation is a gift and that it is important to respect and protect the freedom to donate or not to donate organs for transplantation, are insufficient."
"Similarly, the regulations providing for the introduction of a European organ donor card will be insufficient if all the amendments concerning guidance by ethical and moral principles contained in the European Parliament documents are rejected."
"Lack of moral principles and of their use in legislation leads to loss of our societies' moral health and to various abuses in all areas of social life, including science and medicine."
"In addition to the spread of liberalism and commercialism, vast social differences are a cause of the trade in organs and of other abuses."
"There are very rich people who can buy anything, including organs for transplantation."
"There are also those who are destitute."
"They may donate their organs as a last resort or under duress, and thus reduce their chances for good health and survival."
"This state of affairs will not be changed by assurances about equal opportunities and equal access to health services."
"There is a requirement for real social protection and for statutory protection of human health and life."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to congratulate Dr Adamos Adamou on this report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"Not a single Member voted against it; nor did anyone oppose it any of the committees that were asked for their opinion."
"That this unique level of consensus was achieved is also due to the frequent and long debates on this report organised by the rapporteur, and I would like to thank him for that."
"Our task in the area of organ transplantation is twofold."
"On the one hand, we want to help people for whom transplantation offers the only possibility of staying alive, and on the other hand, it is our duty to prevent organ trafficking, which is one of the most serious criminal acts."
"We know that trade in organs is at present particularly active in the poorer parts of the world, where organ donation is providing the poor with the only possibility of survival."
"I therefore find it shocking that in today's European Union, based on values, morals and ethics, some people are asking for this trade to be legalised."
"Since there is a vast difference between the supply of organs - from either live or deceased donors - and the demand for organs, it is important to increase the number of donors."
"In the Health Programme 2008-2013 the Commission includes evaluation of post-transplant results among its health safety priorities, which means that grants can be awarded for these purposes."
"Although I very much welcome the possibility of financing projects from grants, I have a few reservations."
"I know that this debate is not about the Health Programme 2008-2013 but I must emphasise the following aspect."
"As far as the projects concerned, I was surprised at the mathematical discrepancy between the number of projects approved and the number of projects completed: in 2004, 72 projects were approved and 9 were completed; in 2005, 61 projects were approved and 7 were completed; in 2006, 87 projects were approved and not a single one was completed; and in 2007, 6 projects were approved and none was completed."
"Are there any mechanisms available to verify the effectiveness of the projects cofinanced by the European Union?"
"Mr President, the use of human organs for transplantation has increased steadily over the past decades."
"Organ transplantation is now the most cost-effective treatment for end-stage renal failure."
"For end-stage failure of organs such as the liver, lung and heart, it is the only available treatment."
"Transplants are one of the most miraculous achievements of modern medicine, but less than 25% of the UK population are registered organ donors."
"Last year, around 2 400 people in the UK benefited from an organ transplant, but more than a thousand die every year whilst waiting for such a transplant."
"Organ shortage is a common dilemma in all European countries, and there is clearly a need to improve the system supporting organ donation across the EU."
"Therefore, I warmly welcome this report, and I especially welcome the expanded section on organ trafficking."
"A lack of donors has resulted in an exponential growth in transplant tourism to the world's developing nations."
"The international black market in organs is attracting people in search of a kidney or other organ, and people living in abject poverty or other vulnerable circumstances are being exploited."
"They have become a spare parts inventory for the sick."
"However, when illegal organs transplants are practised, safety is often ignored and the lives of both donor and recipient are put at risk."
"British newspapers have already exposed several macabre websites aimed at so-called 'transplant tourists', including the offer of kidneys from executed prisoners in China."
"We should not view this as a distant crime."
"Several European nations have also become embroiled in the transplant trade, including Moldova, Serbia, Turkey and Russia."
"Governments across Europe must do more to prevent this shameful crime, so I would like to congratulate Mr Amadou on what is a wide-ranging and thoughtful report."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his truly excellent report."
"Allow me to take this opportunity to raise an important but highly controversial issue, which, although not the subject of decision presently, nevertheless needs to be addressed at some stage: this is the concept of presumed consent."
"Most potential donors' organs never become available, because the system of obtaining the consent of the donor in life, or of his or her relatives, can never function to such an efficient degree so as to overcome the constraints of narrow time limitations, the sensitive psychosociological manifestations of bereavement and the complex technicalities of organ harvesting and transportation."
"The answer to this problem of organ availability is decidedly to presume that all dead people are donors unless this is specifically objected to in time by a close relative or by the donor when alive."
"I know that this is not easy for legislators to accept, but I hope that this will cause some serious and mature thinking in the future, based on realism and bearing in mind the enormous number of lives that could be saved if such a system were put into effect."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Adamou, we know that demand for organs outstrips supply."
"We also know, however, that the only way to increase supply is to secure the principle of non-commercialisation."
"So there can be no trade in organs, and we cannot permit expense allowances and reimbursement of costs to turn into covert forms of payment."
"The problem of organ trafficking is not taken seriously in the European Union."
"I am pleased to hear from the Commissioner that organ trafficking is to be included at last in the report on trafficking in human beings."
"However, what happens if a European citizen comes, with an organ, from a third country such as the Philippines?"
"No doctor or hospital will query the origin of the organ."
"The European citizen will not be required to prove that it did not come from trafficking."
"That is why we need traceability if we are to eliminate organ trafficking effectively."
"It is here that the European Union has a big responsibility because we cannot permit a situation where people in China, Ukraine or other countries have to live in fear of an organ mafia."
"It is tragic that poverty and desperation should drive people to sell their organs."
"It is equally tragic, of course, that people should have to die because there are too few organs available for transplants, but we do need to consider both sides of the coin."
"Mr President, to be reprieved from death and disease through the gift of an organ is a wonderful thing, but we have a shortage of organs."
"Adult stem cells are a promising development, worthy of mention."
"Many people who would otherwise have needed a transplant are being taken off the list, as their own stem cells are being used to repair their damaged organs."
"Also, in a research setting, new organs have been made for animals, using their own stem cells."
"Such replacement organs do not present rejection problems for the recipient."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for supporting the amendments on equality in organ donation for people with disabilities."
"Research by the Disability Rights Commission suggests that people with disabilities are four times more likely to die from a treatable disease, with organ failure being one of these conditions."
"We must fight such institutionalised discrimination and ensure fair, free and equitable access to organ donation for all."
"I also want to congratulate Mr Derek Rowe and all those at Irish Air Ambulance who, despite receiving no support from the Irish Government, will finally have the first air ambulance operational in Ireland by the end of the year."
"They have based it on the Cornwall Air Ambulance."
"The very first mission of the Cornwall Air Ambulance involved a person who had drowned and donated four of their organs - organs that would have been lost without an air ambulance."
"(PL) Mr President, transplantology is suffering from a shortage of organs."
"Demand is high and therefore big money is involved."
"Where there is big money, abuses will be found."
"Consequently a new kind of crime emerges."
"There are examples of purchases from poor donors - for a few pennies kidneys can be bought for transplantation."
"We hear of organs being harvested from executed persons, whose permission has not been sought."
"We hear of potential donors being kidnapped and killed so that organs can be obtained."
"There are cases of death being accelerated to harvest organs."
"This is what I wish to address."
"Since transplantology emerged, the definition of death has changed."
"A criterion of brain death emerged - defined for the first time in 1968 in Boston. It is known as the Harvard Criterion."
"Since then new criteria of brain death has emerged, each successive one being less restrictive."
"Cessation of brain activity does not amount to an observation."
"It is a prognosis."
"To verify it, the life-support machine is disconnected, and that in itself can cause death."
"Sometimes the assistance of anaesthetists is enlisted to obtain the organs of the allegedly dead, so that harvesting of a dead body is painless."
"What is needed is a stricter, not more liberal, definition of death."
"Taking of one life to save another is not acceptable."
"(DE) Mr President, if we want a joined-up health policy, then the call to the Commission to table a proposal for a directive on organ donation and transplantation is a timely one."
"The extremely short supply of organs, which persists in some Member States, means that many patients there are on waiting lists for years, and many of them die."
"If we had just 20-30 dead and live donors per million head of population, the European Union would have a good supply of organs."
"Achieving that depends, however, on transplant laws that provide in principle for the removal of organs after death, unless the person concerned has left instructions to the contrary."
"Only Member States with this type of legislation - and there are currently 11 of them - can hope to resolve the problem fairly at European level."
"Article 38, or rather the proposed amendment to it, is at odds with such a solution."
"In Austria, although the principle of organ removal is enshrined in law, an intensive-care specialist with psychological training will also discuss the procedure with the family of the deceased donor, and this system has been very successful."
"If the relatives oppose the organ removal, then their view will be respected."
"Other approaches - such as that taken in Austria's largest neighbouring country - lead to major difficulties with organ supply and thus turn the whole thing into a European problem."
"A functional system of obtaining organs depends on having the same set of rules throughout Europe and on arrangements for organ distribution that are transparent and fair and can be supervised at national level."
"Any approach that fails to put these elements in place will be a capricious waste of time and, at worst, will generate a dubious form of business for poor and mainly non-European countries."
"I know what I am talking about because, as Health Minister in Austria, I was responsible for this issue and our experience with it today is positive."
"The proposal now before this House does not go far enough to resolve the problem at European level."
"I expect and hope for more from you, Commissioner!"
"(NL) Mr President, previous speakers have already made the point that organ donation is an emotive subject."
"It is also a subject which in my view ought largely to be dealt with at Member State level."
"But a European approach may make sense, chiefly when it comes to quality criteria and information-sharing."
"We need to take a tough line on illegal organ trafficking."
"Mr Adamou's own-initiative report makes a significant contribution here and I thank him for it."
"Some members have advocated the introduction of an 'opting out' system, but I have grave reservations about that."
"We cannot force anyone to make a choice about organ donation when the sector itself has not yet weighed the issues clearly and responsibly."
"I am glad that the resolution now before us makes this point a matter for the Member States."
"Lastly, I endorse the amendments tabled by Mrs Sinnot, Messrs Liese and Bowis and others regarding the proven benefits of using adult stem cells."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Adamou on his work."
"If one of the objectives of this report is to break down the barriers to organ donation and to ensure the safety of organ transplantation, the first problem clearly concerns self-sufficiency within each Member State and within the European Union."
"Organ shortage is a problem facing all the Member States to varying degrees."
"Whilst this situation, which has tragic consequences for people who are waiting for an organ transplant, may be one of the causes of organ trafficking, it is not the only one."
"It appears that the root cause of trafficking in human organs is their market value."
"To remedy this situation, at least within the European Union, organ donation must be guided by three basic principles: it must be unpaid, voluntary and anonymous."
"If commercialisation of human organs is not possible, then trafficking will be more difficult."
"In an attempt to resolve this fundamental problem of organ shortage, as highlighted in the report, it is necessary not only to conduct effective public awareness campaigns but also to raise awareness among potential donors."
"Some Member States are already leading the way on this issue."
"It should be noted that, in the case of the donation of blood, which is also in short supply in Europe, several years ago now, we called on every Member State to conduct blood donation campaigns."
"What was the outcome of this request?"
"Can we build on this experience and extend it, and possibly improve it, to include organ donation?"
"Nevertheless, I would like to emphasise a couple of points which worry me: firstly, the donor card is not fit for purpose, and, secondly, the issue of the living donor needs to be regulated more effectively."
"These two points highlight the central role to be played by doctors and surgeons."
"Finally, the report refers to the various possibilities of treatment available using adult stem cells."
"I should also like to mention the opportunities offered by the use of umbilical cord blood stem cells in the treatment of blood cancer, as a substitute for bone marrow transplants."
"Let us not dismiss this approach."
"I already mentioned it at your hearing, Commissioner."
"(SV) Mr President, the question of organ donation is an ethically sensitive issue and must be guided by national values."
"Cooperation across national borders can take place in order to ensure quality and safety, but the choice of whether to donate or receive organs must be the choice of the individual or his or her family."
"This choice often has its roots in a cultural context."
"The proposed European donor card is inappropriate, as rules on consent, allocation and organisational structure differ from one Member State to the next."
"Health is and should remain a national issue."
"Nevertheless, the Swedish June List is in favour of voluntary exchange of organs and expertise among the existing organisations in Member States."
"Parliament's proposed measures to encourage debate on organ donation, on national transplant hotlines, positive media exposure for organ donation and educating sports stars may possibly be justified, but these initiatives must be decided by the Member States themselves on the basis of the prevailing social climate in the respective country."
"(SK) I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my fellow Member Mr Adamou."
"Because of the shortage of organs, some people are quick to use criminal methods."
"They have turned concern for human beings into lucrative trade in human organs, and children are the group most at risk."
"Two weeks ago I made an appeal in Slovakia, and now I am appealing to the European Parliament and the European Commission, for an intensive campaign to increase parents' awareness of the dangers threatening their children."
"We must launch a pan-European campaign entitled 'Do you know where your child is now?'."
"This campaign should increase parents' sense of responsibility for their children."
"We need to take this issue very seriously and the European Union must adopt measures to tackle the transnational nature of the illegal trade in human organs."
"(HU) An unreasonably large number of people die or suffer because there is no organ available in time for transplantation."
"But many people do not consider use of their organs after death an ethical problem, if they know that this can be done, but because of inadequate information they do not donate their organs."
"Naturally everyone must make their own decision, and no one can overrule them or force them."
"It is important, however, that citizens in our various countries understand that, with different rules in different Member States, if they do not make provision for donating their organs, some countries will permit transplantation while others do not."
"I welcome the European Parliament's proposal for a legal representative to decide on the use of organs after death if the deceased person has made no other provision."
"The illegal trade in organs is a most loathsome crime associated with organ transplants."
"Robust action must be taken against it, and, especially when those who are termed allies of the west pursue it, covering up these crimes would be a collective shame."
"(ET) Organ transplants must take place quickly."
"No more than a couple of hours must elapse between removal and transplantation."
"Therefore public awareness and public opinion play an important role in increasing organ donation."
"Organ donation and transplantation are medical procedures, and in order for them to be further developed there must be full public involvement and greater public awareness."
"The most effective means of increasing public readiness would appear to be improving knowledge of transplant issues among the public and the media."
"This must be the first step."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise that, given that there is currently no European coordination of organ exchange, making an improvement in that area is very important, specifically with regard to coordination of the system for organ exchange such as it currently exists between the Member States, for example through a European donor card or a European hotline."
"(PL) Mr President, I see that in general we all agree that organ transplants must not be a commercial activity."
"Any commercial utilisation of organs is simply unethical and contrary to basic human values."
"Huge demand for organs for transplantation may lead to pathology or, indeed, crime."
"All of Europe was recently appalled by those parts of Carla Del Ponte's book where she spoke of Albanian terrorists who used Serbian citizens from Kosovo for commercial transplantation."
"This is the issue that the European Parliament and the Member States should address."
"I believe that the informed consent of the donor must always be a basis for donation and for transplantation of organs."
"There is a need to secure such a solution which must be the norm in Europe."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps not everyone knows that the first organ transplant in the world was performed in Vienna in 1902 by a person of Hungarian origin, Imre Ulmann."
"This particular link with the Austrian capital has existed since then, and so strongly that, even though personnel and technical resources are roughly the same, Hungarian lung transplants are still carried out in Vienna."
"And why not?"
"It costs three times as much and even then the number of patients is even limited."
"There is no doubt but that transplant coordinators have to be appointed in the intensive care units of European hospitals."
"The number of these in Hungary is at present precisely zero, while Spain reportedly has 156."
"As regards heart transplants, my own country has outstanding results, performing well in international comparisons, but we are at the bottom of the list in Europe."
"The reason is the lack of donors, lack of equipment, air travel, and the human resources required."
"Hopefully this report will help to address these anomalies since the problem lies not in our hearts but in our minds."
"Thank you, and I propose that the report be adopted."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his report."
"Tonight, there are 700 people in Scotland waiting for an organ transplant: that is 700 families waiting for calls that could guarantee their loved ones' survival."
"The need for consensus on this sensitive subject is essential, and it is a sad day when Member States cannot agree on this."
"I would like the system of organ donation to be, as Mr Matsakis has said, a system into which everyone has opted in to donate, unless they have requested to opt out."
"That would help with the supply side, particularly for the young and those from an ethnic minority, where shortages are most acute."
"Such a system would help save European lives."
"While I welcome the Commission's action plan, let us make sure that it is not too little, too late."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has been a very interesting and lively debate and no wonder, given the seriousness and importance of this problem."
"Now, a lot of issues have been raised."
"I will try to comment on some of them."
"Non-commercialisation of organs is a very important issue and I believe, and agree, that organ donation should be done on an altruistic and voluntary basis."
"That is why, of course, donor cards should be voluntary, and the same applies to the European donor card, which we intend to introduce in our action plan."
"Good practices exist in some Member States and these good practices should be shared with other Member States for the benefit of all."
"The Commission's directive on quality and safety will, I assure you, be flexible enough not to affect donation whilst ensuring basic requirements throughout the European Union."
"I also want to confirm that traceability will be included in the directive."
"Consent for donation is a particularly sensitive issue, which needs to take into account local and cultural attitudes to donation and transplantation."
"I wish to point out, on this point, that national authorities are responsible for deciding the legal requirements and practices regarding donation consent in their own Member State and for ensuring that their citizens are aware of their rights in this area."
"I would like to say that the use of stem cells from cord blood has proved to be useful for the treatment of some malignant diseases, such as cancer."
"The Commission supports the development of cord blood banks and the use of this technology."
"I also think that it is very important that we raise awareness among European citizens, so that we encourage the increase of both live donations and donations after death, because, in this way, we shall also - as I said in the beginning - indirectly fight trafficking."
"In order to prevent transplant tourism, I think it is very important that citizens should be made aware of both the dangers regarding the safety and security of organs and the ethical questions that may arise."
"As we know, in many third countries, very poor and vulnerable people are being exploited for the purpose of organ extraction."
"Finally, honourable Members, I would like to thank you once again for providing us with such a constructive report."
"In particular, I want to stress the fundamental aim of saving lives, whilst recognising the important scientific advances in organ donation."
"I therefore look forward to continuing our close and constructive collaboration and presenting the Commission's proposal to this House later this year."
"Mr President, let me thank all those who have spoken on this particularly sensitive subject and allow me to make some comments."
"Mr Maaten and others spoke about the European donor card, which we have adopted as an addition to what is provided in Member States."
"Mr Maaten quoted some correct figures: 80% of citizens surveyed were in favour, but only 12% have a donor card."
"However, another statistic should give us cause for concern: of those who had a donor card when the time came for them to become donors, 50% did not donate their organs because their families refused."
"There are thus problems that we cannot be sure will be solved with a European donor card."
"As for the point raised by Mr Matsakis about 'presumed consent', this is a matter for the Member States."
"According to my fellow Member who spoke about Scotland, presumed consent solves the problem."
"It is up to the Member States to decide whether to adopt such a measure."
"We should not forget the principle of subsidiarity."
"In this case, we must see which systems have succeeded, so that we can exchange experience and procedures, as in the case of Spain, to which Mrs Sornosa Martínez has referred."
"Why do we not have in different hospitals coordinators, specialised doctors and nurses, able to recognise potential donors so that transplants can go ahead and we can thus increase the availability of organs?"
"Mrs Auken, who is not here at the moment, has said that we will never be able to fill the shortfall in organ donation."
"As a doctor and a scientist, my answer is that perhaps I will not live to see the day, or future generations will, but in the decades to come we will be able to make the organ we want from the cells of the individual who needs it, maybe from his skin or from elsewhere."
"Commissioner, you spoke about umbilical cord blood cells and about their storage."
"Now let me point out that we really must not let them fall into the hands of private firms operating for profit. In my country, Cyprus, the Karaiskakio Foundation provides this service free of charge."
"There are also three private firms charging parents to store umbilical cord blood cells."
"These cells are also precursor and stem cells; they are very valuable, as you know."
"What can I say about the reference made to trade?"
"My fellow Member referred to the report by Carla Del Ponte."
"I expected to see this report earlier, to be honest."
"Naturally, it is yet more proof that trafficking is also taking place in the enlarged Europe."
"I thank all of you once again."
"I think that the time has now come for us as European citizens to take action."
"We must mobilise, coordinate, raise the awareness of those around us and set a good example: we must become organ donors ourselves."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 22 April 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (BG) This is to express my deep satisfaction with Mr. Adamou's report."
"I support the opinion that to reduce the shortage of organs is the main challenge EU Member States face in terms of organ transplantation."
"On 9/04/2008 my colleagues from the ATAKA Party Dimitar Stoyanov and Desislav Chukolov and I submitted a written declaration in support of informed consent for organ, tissue and cell donation in Bulgaria in which we called upon the European Commission to come up with a proposal on the quality and safety of organ donation."
"The introduction of a European donor card as a supplement to existing national systems will contribute for the rapid identification of donors and thus increase the availability of necessary transplant material."
"Public awareness about organ donation and transplantation and the introduction of uniform EU legislation and strict criminal prosecution measures against those engaged in organ trafficking, including against medical staff, will serve as safeguards for donation procedures and informed consent."
"Once again I congratulate you on your report, sir."
"in writing. - (RO) Support for the proposal of a European Parliament resolution on policy actions at the European Union level on organ donation and transplantation."
"I request that the European Commission propose a more comprehensive directive that would set quality and safety requirements for the donation and transport of organs in the European Union."
"This directive would also provide methods of preventing potential abuse."
"The new legislative act should supplement and strengthen the Member States' efforts to improve the present situation, imposing lines of conduct at a European level, by taking into account the progress in medicine."
"I insist on Member State involvement, including the Member State I come from, Romania, in educating citizens by presenting the advantages of organ donation and acknowledging the fact that organ donation and transplantation mean lives saved."
"I also support the involvement of the European Commission in organizing public debates together with the relevant European non-governmental organizations, in order to identify the best solutions, both as regards the communication campaign and the turning to account of the Member States' experience and good practice."
"The response speed is essential in such cases."
"Better organization of the medical system at a national level is necessary, as well as making paramedics sensitive to such emergencies"
"in writing. - This is a crucial report and a real opportunity to save lives."
"Chronic shortages of organs across Europe are causing 60 000 unnecessary deaths."
"Therefore, urgent action is needed:"
"1."
"Removal of restrictions in organ donation and increased cooperation across Member States and the number of quality safe organs available for transplantation."
"What is required is a Commission directive that adds value and sets common EU-wide quality and safety standards which complement existing arrangements in Member States."
"2."
"Encourage Member States to adopt a system of 'opting out' rather than 'opting in' to organ donation."
"This would enable greater awareness of shortages, and would allow more people to actively consider their position on the issue."
"3."
"I fully support the emphasis in this report on illegal trafficking of organs."
"I am especially concerned that it is often the poorest who are targeted for donating organs."
"We must end this cruel exploitation of poverty and protect the innocent victims who are tricked into losing their organs."
"This is not just a problem in developing countries but also in eastern Europe."
"I want to see strong measures put in place through Europol and Interpol to curb this illegal trade."
"in writing. - (HU) I welcome Mr Adamos Adamou's report on organ donation and the trade in organs."
"Even though technical expertise in this area is unfortunately often at very different levels in the Member States, the use of human organs for transplantation has increased dramatically in recent decades."
"There are around 40 000 people on waiting lists in western Europe, and as a result of this the trade in organs, as a form of livelihood, is flourishing in the poorer areas of eastern European countries."
"The European donor card represents a good solution to the legal issues of donation, but more robust measures need to be applied to trafficking and trading in organs."
"Given that, despite isolated attempts, there is no easy-to-use record system for organs available for transplantation even at national level, it is important to introduce a certificate, similar to the Schengen system, accessible on the Internet, valid throughout the whole Union, supported by medical opinion and a single Union transplantation database."
"Certified establishments engaged in the legal transplantation of human organs would have this life-giving information available instantly and could set up bipartite agreements, while the poor and vulnerable would be protected from becoming victims of organ trafficking."
"The creation of a database is an absolute necessity so that organs available in several countries can be used, and it is therefore vital that the Member States discontinue legislation prohibiting this."
"It is also important that organ donation remains strictly 'non-commercial' but the conditions under which financial compensation can be offered must be defined."
"Any lack of or delay in action in the sector of organ donation costs lives that could be saved."
"As Europeans we have a lot to learn from one another."
"Moreover, countries with experience and infrastructure in this sector can help other countries, like Malta, that may not have the critical mass, especially in cases of rare conditions."
"Recently the Maltese and Gozitan people were moved by the case of Jamie Zammit."
"Jamie is having problems finding a donor to save him from a condition known as Fanconi anaemia because in Malta we do not currently have a register of bone marrow donors."
"The Maltese Government has now announced that it is going to set up such a register."
"This is good news."
"However, in order to set it up, we require the specialised procedure of HLA typing, which does not yet exist in Malta, and we also need long-term training in other countries so that this can be introduced."
"I am appealing that, out of European solidarity, Malta is given all the help it needs, particularly until this system is set up in our country, so that we can save as many innocent lives as possible."
"in writing. - (RO) The penury of organs, which has led to the rapid development of mercantilism and tourism in organs, represents an essential health problem the European Union is dealing with."
"Organ trafficking is caused by a combination of factors such as poverty, corruption and criminality, a reason why the countries of Eastern Europe are the most exposed to this phenomenon."
"In order to prevent this ""transplantation tourism”, the report of the Committee on the Environment requests that organ donation be performed altruistically and voluntary, without becoming a source of profit for the donors."
"Member States should take action to protect the poorest and more vulnerable donors so that they do not become victims of organ trafficking."
"Nevertheless, there are considerable difference between the EU Member States as regards the ways in which they organize donation and transplantation activity, the community of donors and the sources of organ procurement."
"For instance, the low number of donors in Romania is due to the absence of an efficient system for identifying donors and doctors prepared to coordinate the organization of transplantation."
"For this reason, the European average for the number of donors is 20, and in Romania, only 0.5."
"We need adequate technical and logistics infrastructures, as well as psychological and organizational support to reduce the differences between demand and offer."
"Today, almost a thousand patients are registered for transplants in Austria."
"Unfortunately not all these seriously ill patients will get the transplant that may save them."
"Every year some 150 patients die while awaiting a transplant because of the very limited number of available donor organs."
"Organ shortage is a major challenge facing Europe."
"That is why we need a directive on the quality and safety of organ donations."
"Equally, however, we need cooperation between Member States and an exchange of good practice."
"There are, currently, considerable differences within Europe in the number of organ donations and in the transplant quota."
"Cooperation among Member States should focus on discovering the most efficient systems, exchanging experience and promoting well-established procedures."
"Member States must learn from one another."
"I am convinced that live donation should always remain complementary to post-mortem donation."
"Moreover, it is important for donations to remain voluntary and unpaid."
"Transfers of money between donor and recipient are unacceptable."
"The Commission and the Member States must take measures to combat transplant tourism and the illegal trade in organs more effectively."
"The role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Marian Harkin on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development on the role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on my report on volunteering and the contribution that volunteering makes to economic and social cohesion."
"First of all, I would like to thank all my colleagues on the Committee on Regional Development for their excellent cooperation on this report and, in particular, the shadow rapporteurs."
"I also want to record my thanks to the Commission officials, the ALDE Group staff and Parliament staff on the Committee on Regional Development for their interest and assistance."
"Over 100 million Europeans volunteer - that is an incredible figure!"
"According to the Commission, between one third and half of the EU population are involved in some kind of voluntary activity."
"In my opinion, we as an institution have a responsibility to recognise, to value and to support voluntary activity at every possible opportunity."
"Volunteering is a unique activity in many ways: it is open to all and is freely given; it contributes to social cohesion and to economic cohesion; it puts one of the most important European values - that of solidarity - into action."
"Whether it is an individual delivering meals on wheels to an elderly neighbour, or the thousands who mobilise in the event of a natural disaster, such as floods or forest fires, volunteers can help build communities and reduce alienation."
"Volunteering as an activity spans generations."
"It is a resource, sometimes latent, residing within communities, organisations and networks."
"It is an energy within each one of us, but it is only activated when we engage with others."
"It is, in my opinion, a most valuable form of renewable energy."
"There is a strong link between volunteering and active citizenship: involvement in voluntary activities is a tangible expression of participatory democracy."
"In this Parliament, we represent our citizens and we as politicians engage in representative democracy, but sometimes we do not pay enough attention to the other side of the equation: participatory democracy."
"This is where citizens, through their activities, participate in the democratic process, and volunteering facilitates this important process."
"Moving on to my report, it contains a number of practical suggestions as to how we can add value at European level."
"The Commission has a role to play in ensuring that Member States adhere to the partnership principle enshrined in the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion and to ensure that we do not continue with the illusion of inclusion of NGOs, voluntary groups etc., as is the current situation in many Member States."
"I also believe that a system should be put in place across all European funds, whereby voluntary activity is recognised as a contribution to co-financing projects."
"If we do this, we show by our actions that we support volunteers."
"We should expand the opportunities and programmes already in place to facilitate volunteering among young people and put in place similar opportunities and programmes to facilitate volunteering for older people."
"And we should, at every possible opportunity, promote intergenerational volunteering."
"Another area where the Commission can act is in facilitating a more liberal visa regime, where volunteers from neighbouring countries are involved in EU-sponsored programmes."
"Member States can play a significant role by producing regular satellite accounts, so that the value of volunteering and not-for-profit institutions can be measured."
"The figures for many countries, including the US, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Canada, indicate that not-for-profit institutions account for between 5% and 7% of GDP."
"Policymakers cannot ignore these figures and must take them into account when formulating policy."
"Furthermore, for every euro organisations spent on supporting volunteers, they received an average return of between 3% and 8%."
"Not even the ECB can match that rate of return."
"Member States can also support voluntary activity by establishing sustainable volunteering infrastructure to deal with issues such as core funding, insurance cover and VAT exemptions where appropriate."
"Finally, one of our tasks in the EU is to make a positive impact on the lives of citizens and to add value at European level."
"We can do this by supporting volunteers and voluntary activity in a tangible way."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank Ms Harkin very much indeed for her report."
"The report relates to many EU policies and many initiatives, emphasising the strong link between volunteering and active citizenship."
"I particularly appreciate your comments on the PEACE programme, where the involvement of volunteering was indeed strong."
"We will meet here again in May to discuss the report of Ms de Brún, in which, I am convinced, examples of local empowerment, in particular through the voluntary sector and non-governmental organisations, will be strongly present."
"With regard to your recommendation on in-kind contribution, let me say that, while Article 56 of the general Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund already allows for in-kind contribution to EU co-financed projects, the real challenge is the use of this provision."
"But let me say that, in particular in local initiatives, which are co-financed by the Social Fund, it is quite common for volunteers to provide a noteworthy contribution, while there have been also many activities, especially within the URBAN initiative in Germany, Italy, the UK and Greece, which have supported a wide range of voluntary organisations."
"Volunteering can be seen as a strong component of the partnership principle."
"Many times in this House, I have reiterated the Commission's full commitment towards the effective implementation of the partnership principle, in particular in the new generation of cohesion policy."
"We insisted on partnership during the negotiations of new programmes and we have now many positive examples of strong commitment to the partnership."
"But of course, as you know, we have a great variety of approaches towards partnership and volunteering in our Member States."
"I also see the role of your report in preparing the ground for the next own-initiative report on governance and partnership at national, regional and local level, to be presented by Mr Beaupuy."
"Let me say a few words on specific policies and initiatives in the area of volunteering in which the Commission has been particularly active."
"Worth mentioning is the European Voluntary Service and active European citizenship in the EU's new lifelong learning programme."
"My colleague Ján Figeľ is currently preparing a new initiative on voluntary activities of young people, which will incorporate many of the aspirations expressed in your report."
"Enhancing and promoting trans-European voluntary activities will further reinforce the mobility of our young citizens."
"In its new initiative, the Commission will seek to ensure a greater interoperability of existing national voluntary schemes."
"The White Paper on sport also stresses that voluntary activities in the sport sector strengthen social cohesion and inclusion and promote local democracy and active citizenship."
"There is also the reference to sport in the Lisbon Treaty, which provides for 'the promotion of European sporting issues, while taking account of [...] its structures based on voluntary activity'."
"Here we share the view that we need a more holistic approach to the contribution of volunteering to Europe's economic and social cohesion."
"This should certainly take into account the challenge of the ageing European population."
"In this respect, your suggestion of 'intergenerational volunteering' merits further exploration."
"In this context, I am happy to tell you that the Commission's Directorate-General for Education, Training, Culture and Youth is about to launch an assessment of the state of play of volunteering in Europe."
"This assessment will serve as a source of better knowledge and a solid basis for further initiatives in this field, as no systematic and integrated approach towards volunteering has been developed so far at EU level."
"I am convinced that all those you are addressing in the motion for a resolution will be responsive to your call."
"You can certainly count on the Commission's support."
"Let me also assure you that all other requests that are addressed more specifically to the Commission will be examined, in particular by Commissioners Figeľ and Špidla."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I would like first of all to congratulate Ms Harkin on an excellent and timely report."
"The point is to have better understanding about the potential and role of volunteering, which could be called one of the backbones of civil society."
"Indeed, volunteering is about citizens' initiative and so it is directly related to solidarity, the core value of a united Europe."
"As the rapporteur put it just now, it is one of the most efficient forms of renewable energy."
"I think the point of this report is to encourage Member States to recognise the value of volunteering in promoting social and economic cohesion."
"The state is, of course, not expected to finance volunteering, otherwise it would lose its meaning, but the state is called on to provide incentives for the private sector to support the voluntary sector."
"Parliament also addressed the Commission about the delays in the proposed European Charter on Volunteering, which is expected to define better the role of volunteering."
"A very important part of this report is the call for the promotion of volunteering through education at all levels, beginning with creating opportunities for voluntary activities at an early stage of the education system and also to promote volunteering as part of lifelong learning."
"I would like to express my thanks once more for this excellent cooperation."
"We were able to discuss almost all amendments in a positive and constructive spirit and to make use of the majority of initiatives."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I welcome Marian Harkin's report on volunteering and congratulate her on her collaboration with colleagues in its drafting."
"Over a hundred million EU citizens volunteer, and every one euro spent in supporting them generates a return of between three and eight euros."
"With 1.2 million volunteers in Scotland - with its population of 5 million - and the voluntary sector amounting to 5% of Scotland's workforce, we must publicly recognise volunteers' efforts throughout Scotland and the EU."
"The report gives credit to volunteers and focuses on the benefits of volunteering for the economy and social cohesion."
"It rightly demands that this contribution should appear in national accounts."
"It states that volunteering contributes about as much to gross domestic product in a wide range of countries as the construction industry or the utilities industry."
"This means that the not-for-profit sector accounts for 5% to 7% of the GDP in some EU countries."
"Volunteering is good for you, your community, your region's economic development and your national economy."
"It also helps build the social capital that public policies need to succeed."
"I urge the European Commission to put in place a plan 'B' which would ensure valuing, validating and visibility for volunteers throughout Scotland and the rest of the EU, and I urge colleagues to support the Harkin report."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to join my colleagues in thanking and congratulating Mrs Harkin for having produced this report."
"The choice of rapporteur is not a random one, as Mrs Harkin has extensive experience in the area of volunteering, and it is therefore only natural that she tabled this report."
"We have, of course, approved heartily of her being given this report, which she has drafted in a true spirit of consensus, for, as you will have noticed, we have tabled only one amendment, with which she is in agreement."
"This demonstrates the quality of her report, and I feel that this deserves to be strongly emphasised."
"Commissioner Danuta Hübner, you have, to some extent, beaten us to the punch and given answers, right from the beginning of your speech, to questions raised in this report."
"I should like to thank you in advance, and it is most likely that several of the other speeches made by Members will enable you, later and over the next few days, to provide further answers from the Commission."
"I should like to emphasise, in addition to what has already been said and further to what has been written in the report, that if there are 100 million Europeans who dedicate themselves to helping some 500 million Europeans every day, it must not be forgotten that these 100 million Europeans who volunteer receive personal gain from so doing, not in the financial sense but in the sense of personal fulfilment."
"You all know, we all know, I am certain, of sports teams and cultural and social leaders without whom our non-governmental associations and organisations would not operate."
"It must be said that these people need this commitment for their personal development."
"In an ageing society, in a society where there is an increasing number of young retirees, we also need this individual work-life balance that is achieved through volunteering."
"Therefore, for economic reasons, but also with a view to the fulfilment of the human values shared by Europe's citizens - more than 100 million of them - let us make efforts to promote voluntary work in our societies and hope that, in the years to come, there will be well in excess of 100 million European citizens engaged in voluntary activity."
"Thanks to Marian Harkin, thanks to the Commission, thanks also to the governments and the regional and local authorities that are ready, tomorrow, to show their support, through their actions, for the wishes expressed by the European Parliament."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the UEN Group I wish to express our huge appreciation to Marian Harkin for tackling this subject."
"Voluntary activity is voluntary, unpaid and intentional work for others."
"It transcends family or friendship relationships."
"Although this is work without material remuneration, a volunteer receives satisfaction of a different kind: he or she fulfils his or her motivation, realises him or herself, and shows solidarity with others."
"Voluntary activity is highly educational for the youth and very invigorating for the elderly."
"In this context the influence of voluntary organisations on the strengthening of local and regional communities should be seen as very positive."
"I believe it helps to build civil society in which one individual selflessly helps another and is sympathetic towards others without being a threat."
"The Irish example, which I had the pleasure to learn about, is a good one."
"Such understanding of voluntary activity also means that the volunteer, who is often also a benefactor, must not suffer any material penalty when helping others and offering them gifts."
"I refer here to a case that is well known in Poland, of a baker whose business folded because he was required to pay taxes on bread he gave to poor people."
"I also wish to highlight the very fine idea of declaring 2011 European year of volunteering."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I too would like to thank Marian Harkin very much indeed for her balanced and comprehensive report."
"It is the product of a shared effort to give greater recognition at European level to the aims, substance and social significance of voluntary work."
"There are countless voluntary initiatives currently in place in the Member States which make important contributions, not only economically but also socially and in terms of integration."
"However, the European dimension so necessary for networking is often lacking."
"We are already familiar with the European Voluntary Service for young people, and we need similar programmes for all age groups, particularly for the growing numbers of retired people who are active, healthy and experienced."
"They too could contribute significantly to making the European Community more meaningful, and existing measures under our regional and cohesion policies could be used to make this possible."
"We need appropriate framework conditions and definitions that are as clear as possible, in the interests of long-term and short-term development for all the voluntary sector partners."
"Initial steps have been taken by the Commission and also by the Council."
"My hope is that both those institutions will take up Parliament's proposals and suggestions, so that we can make the European Year of Volunteering - jointly proposed for 2011 - a real success."
"(NL) Mr President, volunteers do a great deal, at both local and regional level."
"Their efforts give social cohesion a very personal face."
"There is a difference between towns in certain parts of Europe."
"In the 'new' Member States the level of volunteering is still much lower."
"A lot of work is being done, and Mrs Harkin's report emphasises positive ideas for supporting volunteers and encouraging action at all levels."
"The Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats takes the view that there is no question of volunteers on the one hand and professionals on the other."
"The two are not mutually exclusive: neither group can function without the help of the other."
"Both groups, professionals and volunteers, are part of the social model that Europe exemplifies, of civil society, in which the citizen too has an important voice."
"That is the famous partnership principle."
"There is one point I would like to raise following the debate in committee."
"The new Paragraph 17 deals with whether or not volunteer work should be rewarded with tax incentives."
"The answer is yes, but the form these take may vary considerably."
"That is a matter for our individual states to decide when we talk about VAT."
"My home country of the Netherlands has its own special system: the activities of sports associations are exempt, for example, and other activities such as canteen management are partly exempt, as is third-party sponsorship."
"So in 2010, when the VAT system comes up for review, it would be good to take this report on board and be able to point to examples of good practice in the Member States which others might usefully emulate."
"Lastly, to make the point once more, volunteering deserves our broad support in the work of churches, politics and the rest of society."
"(PL) Mr President, promoting an active and conscious role for citizens in society is one of the main principles held by the European Socialist family."
"We support involvement in voluntary activities when this is a concrete expression of participatory democracy."
"At European level voluntary activity is a practical expression of such European values as solidarity, cohesion and social integration."
"For many people, except for taking part in elections at various levels, their participation in organisations of this nature is their only experience linked to the democratic process."
"It is therefore satisfying that more than 20% of EU inhabitants take part in various voluntary activities."
"Such activities help to reduce economic differences and are a catalyst in the activities of various associations, and they therefore create social capital."
"The concept of social capital is increasingly used by organisations such as OECD or the World Bank in the context of local socioeconomic development."
"The European Union should increase its support for the various forms of participation, in particular in relation to regional planning and local development, utilising EU's political strategies and European funds."
"(RO) First of all, I would like to congratulate Mrs. Rapporteur for her work and the special involvement in this subject."
"I have followed this report closely, since volunteering has a major importance in current society."
"The positive effects can be measured in terms of social cohesion, human rights protection, medical-sanitary assistance, promotion and organization of cultural, artistic and educational activities."
"The effects are essential for the population and the economy."
"Yet this activity is underestimated, in my opinion and too unfamiliar to the public."
"The consequences are negative for volunteer work since there are insufficient actions of support from the state, even if it can represent a considerable part of a country's economy."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, coming from a former communist country, I can tell you about the very low volunteer participation in my country."
"Since the communist regime introduced mandatory unpaid work in order to serve the state, this practice is now associated with that period in the people's subconscious."
"Today, the percentage of volunteers in Romania is much lower than in most Member States."
"The activity is often unknown to the citizens, the state policy does not encourage it and people's mentality is also not in favour of this activity."
"Citizens should be informed about the positive effects of volunteering."
"On the other hand, we should avoid the abusive situations that have happened, for instance organizations that have adopted this legal status for making profit."
"I support volunteering as an important activity and I would like it to be promoted and supported throughout the European Union, especially in the former communist countries where efforts should be strengthened."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, let me also congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work, and stress that contributing and volunteering in society are invaluable."
"At national and local level they are the means by which participatory democracy expresses itself and they allow for the active participation of citizens in the public arena."
"At European level, volunteering can contribute to the creation of stronger ties between EU citizens."
"Furthermore, through the additional human resources it offers to social and economic life, and also through its contribution to the creation of social capital, volunteering contributes importantly to achieving the EU's goals for economic and social cohesion."
"The added value of volunteering should not be underestimated."
"Particularly today, with the EU facing significant social, economic and environmental challenges, volunteering should not only be encouraged, but also supported by European policies, especially by that of cohesion."
"Member States and regional authorities ought to try to ensure that voluntary groups and projects can transparently and flexibly have access to adequate, sustainable funding from the Structural Funds."
"Mr President, can I first of all begin by thanking Ms Harkin for all her hard work and this insightful and timely report, which was so well received by the Regional Committee."
"I fully support the central theme of the report - that volunteering, through its emphasis on participation and solidarity, strengthens civil society and bonds between the communities."
"I welcome the report's stance on the role that Member States should play regarding volunteers."
"I fully agree with the position that volunteering should be complementary to - and should not be intended to replace - public services."
"In this regard, the role that carers play in our societies, in countries all over Europe, comes to mind."
"Often these dedicated people are forgotten, even though their care of the elderly and the disabled removes a huge burden from state resources."
"The report also wisely points out that volunteering can be hugely beneficial for young people, fostering a sense of community and allowing them to develop practical skills which complement their formal education."
"Another point advocated by the report is that special efforts should be made to promote volunteering among senior citizens."
"The involvement of this age group affords communities an opportunity to benefit from their wealth of experience and reinforces their essential place in society."
"For me, however, this report has added significance: in my constituency in Northern Ireland we are in the process of rebuilding a society which has been deeply affected by violence and conflict."
"Although we have now entered a period characterised by peace and greater prosperity, in certain areas of the province the effects of social exclusion, under-development and division are still all too evident."
"Ms Harkin's report specifically acknowledges the positive role volunteering can play in divided societies, and, if we consider the case of Northern Ireland, the whole concept underpinning the peace process packages has been that people work together on a cross-community basis in order to promote understanding and reconciliation."
"To a great extent these initiatives have had a positive effect."
"Therefore I hope that Parliament's adoption of this report will ensure that the importance of volunteering is acknowledged and that the Commission and Member States will do all in their power to facilitate and encourage this practice."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report by our fellow Member Mrs Harkin on volunteering is a way for the European Parliament to demonstrate its social aspect to European citizens."
"The report promotes the idea of contribution, which is dealt with comprehensively and objectively on both a theoretical and practical level."
"Our fellow Member's work is important; I welcome it and congratulate her warmly."
"We in turn have also tried to contribute to her activity."
"We have among other things brought out the importance of corporate volunteering, the coordination of voluntary initiatives reconciling family with professional life, as well as the creation of rapid action volunteer sections in every region to deal speedily with natural disasters and accidents."
"In general terms, volunteering helps among other things to increase GDP."
"As has been said, volunteering boosts skill acquisition and improves employability of a volunteer."
"It provides socially and educationally excluded persons and the unemployed with genuine opportunities and encourages immigrants to participate in the local community."
"The actions and the activity of volunteers speak for themselves."
"In my country, Greece, for example, the 2004 Olympic volunteers won us our most significant medal."
"Both individual and group volunteering are vital in social, economic, environmental and cultural terms."
"They unify all differences and peculiarities, while promoting them and revealing them in a spirit of concord and common aims."
"I congratulate the rapporteur once more."
"I call on you to support Mrs Harkin's report and to join us in signing the joint written declaration that we have drawn up with other Members, asking that 2011 should be declared the European Year of Volunteering."
"Mr President, voluntary work, apart from its economic aspect, is of great educational value, particularly for young volunteers, be it at home or abroad, in various areas of social, economic and educational life."
"Voluntary may mean 'no payment', but we as European institutions can help intensify it by various means."
"Regarding the report, which I consider important in raising our level of consciousness, there is something missing."
"One group not mentioned here are male and female convents, missionaries who either do voluntary work around the world or organise and promote such work."
"I would welcome a monetary estimation of their contribution to people's well-being."
"Voluntary work is the product of intrinsic motivation and pure altruism, which are values that cannot be overestimated."
"This is a report crucial to our way of thinking."
"(PL) Mr President, the work of volunteers is not always valued as highly as it should be."
"The shaping of civic attitudes through voluntary work is not always given due attention."
"Local authorities are responsible for organising and delivering social assistance, including feeding the poor."
"Sometimes a local NGO charity performing voluntary activity has to pay high rent to local government for premises such as kitchens and canteens for the poor and homeless."
"Moreover, it sometimes does not receive any resources for food or for insuring volunteers."
"Since the volunteers are not remunerated, they are unable to support the activities of the NGO."
"In this context I would draw your attention to Paragraph 15 of the report."
"The demographic situation in Europe highlights the increasing role of the voluntary sector, primarily in helping to care for the elderly."
"That is why the document presented here is so important."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Harkin."
"(PL) Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to two specific forms of voluntary activity."
"The first is the transfer of know-how in a highly specialised area."
"Experienced and educated people transfer their knowledge, skills or perhaps the achievements of their occupational group to others."
"Those benefiting from such know-how are often in the early stages of their education, of assimilation of knowledge or skills, of facing new challenges, of their own transformation."
"The other area of volunteering concerns young people."
"It teaches life skills and promotes their involvement in civic life."
"Travel to other countries as part of volunteering, in turn, promotes inter-cultural dialogue and teaches tolerance and respect."
"This is why local and national authorities and international organisations should do more to support and promote volunteering."
"(BG) We all agree with the conclusion made in Mrs. Harkin's excellent report that volunteering can play an important role for the development of local communities, civil society and democracy."
"That is why volunteering and volunteer organisations need encouragement and support."
"I would like to note, in this respect, that the establishment of a European database to provide basic information on the various volunteer organisations in the European Union and detail on best practices will provide necessary guidance on how to improve the system of volunteer work."
"The establishment of a single European database will enable a more effective partnership and cooperation among volunteer organisations and strengthen international volunteer exchange arrangements."
"This is particularly important for young people and school children."
"By acquiring experience in volunteer organisations at an early stage, they would perceive participation in volunteer work as a routine contribution to the life of their local communities and to European society."
"(PL) Mr President, today we are debating Mrs Harkin's report on volunteering in the European Union."
"The importance of the role of volunteering in Europe in the future depends partly on us."
"I wish only to remind everybody that annually millions of EU citizens volunteer, whether directly or indirectly."
"Voluntary activities take place at local, regional and international level."
"Wherever they take place, they yield profits several times higher than the outlays."
"This is why I believe that there is a need for closer and stronger cooperation between Member States and non-profit organisations and for creating effective systems to facilitate cooperation between all voluntary organisations within individual countries and across borders."
"Taxes imposed on sponsors for their gifts and the fact that VAT is payable by voluntary organisations on purchases made to achieve their objectives are the principal problems holding back and limiting voluntary activity."
"I believe that such problems should be resolved as soon as possible."
"(RO) Allow me to express my full appreciation for the relevance of Mrs Harkin's report, by the discussions on the new economic, social, European model and constant efforts to improve the economic and social cohesion at the European Union level."
"Taking into consideration the solutions it identifies, I consider the report a text that provides a series of generous and extremely useful principles, able to lead to an increase in European citizens' quality of life."
"I believe, as I did on the occasion of the submission of amendments, it probably would have been better to emphasize more firmly, in the report, the modern concept of volunteering, by explicitly stipulating the conditions without which all voluntary action could be interpreted as a unilateral act."
"I would also like to emphasize the role of religions in the achievement of Christian principles related to volunteering."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, just two very short points."
"Let me say that even the best-equipped policies cannot deliver without the strong involvement of all those who feel a co-responsibility, and also the need for commitment and contribution."
"Volunteering and partnership are the best ways to ensure that involvement."
"Let me also assure you that I will share your conclusions with my colleagues in the Commission."
"I am convinced that the future assessment of the state of play of volunteering in Europe, and the follow-up to it, will take inspiration from the resolution you are going to adopt, and also from the discussion I have had the privilege of sharing with you tonight."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, first of all I want to thank everybody for their kind comments and their support in the drafting of this report."
"I would just like to make one or two final comments."
"I appreciate the Commissioner's reference to in-kind contributions by voluntary groups and, while I recognise that in-kind contributions are applicable in some EU-funded projects, I believe we need to ensure that this becomes the status quo."
"I also look forward to Commissioner Figeľ's communication on youth volunteering and Commissioner Hübner's commitment to investigating and, I hope, promoting intergenerational volunteering."
"I am again calling on the Commission to ensure that the partnership principle is adhered to in all negotiations and consultations in the drafting of EU programmes at national level."
"This is crucial, because it is a real recognition by the EU that volunteers, NGOs etc. are part of the process, not just some add-on, not just there for the optics, but an integral part of the process."
"With regard to the one amendment proposed on possible VAT exemptions, it is a good compromise and I am very happy to support it."
"I also want to take this opportunity to call for 2011 to be designated the European Year of Volunteering and ask for the support of Parliament in signing the written declaration which has been proposed by Members from the five largest political groups."
"In this call, I am supported by the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Forum, the Portuguese presidency conclusions and very many voluntary groups across the EU."
"If the Commission were to designate 2011 the European Year of Volunteers, this would allow the EU institutions, in collaboration with voluntary organisations, to work towards common objectives, as I said earlier, to add value at European level."
"Finally in this context, we should encourage the development of civil society and of participative democracy, thereby giving real meaning to the aim of bringing Europe closer to its citizens."
"The promotion, support and facilitation of volunteering and voluntary action, accompanied by the growth in social capital, will prove to be an invaluable tool in achieving those objectives."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 22 April 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
", in writing. - (HU) In Europe more than a hundred million people work as civilian volunteers for the public good and for others."
"In the United Kingdom 38% of the entire population is involved in voluntary activity and in Poland the figure is 18%."
"Voluntary activity cannot be separated from European working life and is seen as a basic tenet of democracy at both local and public level."
"The voluntary work done by our citizens helps solve social problems and promotes the acquisition of skills and social awareness."
"Volunteering offers people from different groups of the population the opportunity for integration and inclusion, the elderly can take part in the life of society, invest a lifetime of experience and feel they have a useful role for longer."
"The incentives for voluntary work are the same as the basic European values: solidarity and a sense of responsibility."
"There is increasing recognition within the EU of the usefulness of voluntary activity and voluntary organisations are being more closely involved in decision-making processes."
"In recent years voluntary sector has become more ramified."
"Interest in volunteering is increasing but due recognition is wanting, material rewards are restricted and the infrastructures are lacking."
"This has to be changed."
"To give support to voluntary work and enhance social recognition, it is important that a community of purpose is created, with transfer of best practice and experience by the active players - government, business, trade unions and voluntary organisations - working together in dialogue and in partnership."
"in writing. - (SK) I would like to speak on a very personal note."
"Although I am a member of the board of a large Slovak national association, the Forum for Life, I know that the volunteers who act independently rather than through specialised associations also represent a ray of hope that penetrates the darkness of loneliness and support the fight against temptations of violence and egotism."
"What prompts a volunteer to care for others?"
"The first element is the natural heartfelt enthusiasm of humans to help those around them."
"This is an almost existential principle of creating the human capital that is so in demand for the future of social cohesion in the regions."
"Volunteers experience happiness that goes beyond their work because they are willing to do their best for others, without expecting any reward."
"It is not enough just to meet people in financial difficulties: it is also essential to respond to their desire for values and their deepest wishes."
"Although the type of help we offer is important, what is even more important is the heart that offers this help."
"Irrespective of whether we are talking about a micro-project or a huge project, volunteering should always be a practical lesson, especially for young people, since it is an educational contribution to the culture of solidarity and togetherness, of offering one's time and energy."
"For me, this is the most important contribution for both present and future generations and their coexistence."
"Statute of the European Ombudsman (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Anneli Jäätteenmäki on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament amending its Decision 94/262/ECSC, EC, Euratom, of 9 March 1994, on the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Diamandouros, ladies and gentlemen, first I wish to thank all parties for their excellent levels of cooperation whilst this report was being produced."
"It was not easy finding a solution that would satisfy everyone, and I understand that some people are still hoping for some changes, but we have achieved a unanimous result in committee."
"It seems appropriate to move forward from here."
"There were four issues relating to the role of Ombudsman."
"These were access to documents, the testimonials of officials, information on criminal cases, and cooperation in the field of human rights."
"There was also a fifth issue in the European Ombudsman's original proposal, his or her power to intervene, but this was contentious and right at the end of the discussion the Ombudsman said that he wanted to withdraw it."
"The most important amendment concerns the obligation of the EU institutions and bodies also to grant the Ombudsman access to classified information and sensitive documents, if deemed necessary for the Ombudsman to do his or her job."
"Up till now the institutions have had the right to refuse to disclose information."
"This will now be the subject of objective, and no longer subjective or arbitrary, consideration."
"This is an important, albeit small, step in the right direction."
"The institutions supplying classified information or documents to the Ombudsman must inform the Ombudsman of their classified status."
"Furthermore, for the rules to be implemented, the Ombudsman may agree with the relevant institutions the operational conditions for access to classified information or other information covered by the obligation of professional secrecy."
"The role of the European Ombudsman has become more important over the years for the European Union institutions and the citizens of Europe."
"With the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the European Union will become legally binding, which will make the job of the Ombudsman even more important."
"In the future we will need to do more to ensure that the Ombudsman has sufficient resources, that his or her Statute reflects the current times, that he or she obtains the information needed and that officials give him or her the right information."
"Under the Charter of Fundamental Rights, every person has the right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within a reasonable time by the institutions and bodies of the Union."
"The resources therefore have to be in place so that citizens do not have to wait years for decisions and can also have confidence in the fact that the Ombudsman will be in possession of all the necessary information and that officials will tell him or her what they know instead of what they want to say."
"Otherwise there is no rule of law, something we are so fond of talking about, even if the EU is not a state as such."
"We ourselves should also comply with the rule of law; only then can we expect others to."
"vice-president of the Commission. - Mr President, it is now 14 years since this Parliament first adopted the European Ombudsman Statute."
"Much has happened since then."
"It is therefore normal and appropriate that the Ombudsman has taken the initiative to modify his statute, and the Commission welcomes that."
"The important thing is this. The citizens must have confidence in the Ombudsman's capacity to conduct thorough and impartial inquiries in alleged cases of maladministration."
"So the Ombudsman needs clear, concise and efficient rules for his important work."
"Right from the beginning, the Commission has followed this initiative very closely, and we have had fruitful discussions with the Ombudsman and Parliament's rapporteur, Ms Jäätteenmäki."
"Our respective services have also had a lot of contact and cooperation."
"The Commission welcomes the general line of this report, and I want to thank the chairman, Mr Leinen, and all committee members - in particular Ms Jäätteenmäki - for their work."
"From the Commission's side, we will deliver our formal opinion very shortly after Parliament requires us to do so."
"Today I would like to briefly summarise our main reflections."
"They have to do with four specific issues."
"First, the hearing of witnesses; secondly, access to files; thirdly, OLAF, and fourth, cooperation in the field of human rights."
"I will say very shortly a few words about each of these points."
"First, about the hearing of witnesses."
"The Commission agrees with Parliament's amendment on the hearing of witnesses, and the purpose of this provision was to recall that officials give testimony not on a personal basis, but in their official capacity."
"We are conscious that the current wording could give the impression that officials might act under instructions and not give authentic and complete evidence."
"This has never happened, but I agree that it is important to modify the wording to avoid misunderstandings."
"Secondly, on access to files, the Commission is in favour of allowing the Ombudsman to consult documents that he needs in the course of his enquiries."
"The Ombudsman has proposed to lift the secrecy exception for access to a file."
"The Commission has never used this exception, but it is important that we are very clear."
"The treatment of classified information has to be carefully considered."
"The same goes for privacy of individuals, protection of proceedings and business secrecy."
"That is why the Commission welcomes Parliament's amendment that, where these kinds of documents are concerned, the Ombudsman should use rules which are strictly equivalent to those in force in the institution concerned."
"With regard to sensitive information, such as data protection and business secrets, the Commission fully shares Parliament's views."
"This also goes for documents relating to proceedings in litigation."
"This means that the Ombudsman should apply the relevant Community law when dealing with requests from third parties for access to documents obtained by the Ombudsman in the course of his inquiries."
"As you know, the relevant Community law - Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 - is currently being updated and the Commission will take a decision in just a few weeks time."
"For these reasons, the Commission agrees with the aim of the amendments on access to documents, but we think maybe a more precise wording would improve the text even more, and we will come back to that when we present our formal opinion."
"The third point, on OLAF: when it comes to the transmission of information on possible criminal activities, the Commission entirely agrees with Parliament that the Ombudsman should be able to notify the European Anti-Fraud Office of any information on matters within its remit and it is not entirely clear that the proposed notion of 'competent institutional body' would cover OLAF."
"A slight rewording could improve the text even more."
"Finally, on cooperation in the field of human rights, the current statute has proved to be a good basis for the European Ombudsman to cooperate with national ombudsmen and similar bodies in the Member States."
"The Commission fully encourages this practice."
"It brings the European institutions closer to its citizens."
"With a tabled amendment, Parliament would like to widen the scope of cooperation to other institutions for the promotion and protection of human and fundamental rights."
"According to Articles 302 and 303 of the Treaty, it is the Commission, as representative of the Community, which establishes all appropriate forms of cooperation with international organisations in general and with the Council of Europe in particular."
"This is why the Commission considers that this proposal goes beyond the mandate given to the Ombudsman by the Treaty."
"This being said, the Commission would be open to an alternative wording, and I hope we will be able to strike the right balance between the Ombudsman's important working contacts and the Treaties that does not impinge on the Commission's institutional prerogatives."
"So these are the Commission's reflections on the issues raised by Parliament's amendments, and after the vote tomorrow we will prepare our opinion and start discussions with the Council."
"This should be done quickly, since we want to facilitate an agreement on the file under the Slovenian presidency."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the EU is undoubtedly going through a particularly difficult period of crisis in credibility."
"Is the EU, I wonder, democratically credible?"
"Indeed, for it to be so, it needs the legitimisation of its citizens, and this is becoming increasingly complex as Europe is enlarged."
"There is always the common foundation on which we built Europe and on which our fellow citizens rely."
"It is a system of values protecting their fundamental rights."
"The need to communicate with European citizens is more pressing than ever."
"It is meaningful only when the EU receives their messages of concern and manages to convince them that the institutions are endeavouring to meet their expectations."
"Citizens do not trust us because they do not feel that we are promoting or even extending their rights."
"Our attempt has got to have a lasting effect, ladies and gentlemen."
"We must monitor historical developments and the new requirements they give rise to."
"The European Ombudsman's primary concern is to ensure the correct operation of the institutional bodies and organisation of the EU, boosting the confidence that citizens need to have in it."
"The proposed changes in the rules of procedure revising the Statute of the Ombudsman equip him effectively for this."
"On behalf of the Committee on Petitions, we support them unreservedly."
"Finally, let me congratulate in particular the rapporteur responsible for this issue, Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for her tireless efforts to achieve a universally acceptable report."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) The debate on the changes to the Statute of the Ombudsman in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was not easy."
"It was a long and very controversial debate and the question at issue was essentially to decide whether extending the Ombudsman's powers was a rational step."
"We started from a clear premise, that the role of each institution in a democratic culture must be well defined and there must be no confusion over these roles."
"The clear definition and rational distribution of roles is the only way to promote legitimacy, effectiveness and accountability of the institutions."
"It was for this very reason that the Ombudsman withdrew his proposal for access to the Court of Justice."
"However, compromises were reached on data protection, access to secret files and cooperation with other institutions on fundamental rights."
"The Ombudsman will now have access to secret files but will not be allowed to disclose such information to third parties."
"Data protection will follow European Union data protection rules."
"It is clear that the Ombudsman can work with other institutions on the issue of fundamental rights, and it seems to me there can be no other way of proceeding."
"Cooperation with institutions on the subject of fundamental rights makes explicit an unwritten principle, given that fundamental rights form the foundations and aim of the European Union."
"However, the compromise reached in what was not an easy debate clarifies what I think must be the inevitable conclusion on this issue: the Ombudsman, as an institution, must always be clear that, when exercising his powers, he must do so in accordance with the criteria of need, appropriateness and proportionality, because these are the criteria of justice."
"Mr President, European Ombudsman, ladies and gentlemen - my dear nocturnal colleagues, perhaps we have delayed a little in debating the improvement to the Statute of the European Ombudsman."
"However, I think that in the end we are doing so at an appropriate moment, because now that the European Parliament is debating in citizens' rights general, it is confronted with a new treaty on the operation of the EU and with a Charter of Fundamental Rights containing an article specific about the right of citizens to make complaints to the European Citizens' Advocate."
"I think it is therefore the right moment to debate the subject of the confidence of citizens in the EU bodies."
"Let me remind you that the European Ombudsman is at the service of European citizens to help them combat maladministration."
"I should like to add that it is high time for the European Parliament itself to show confidence both in its institutions and in the European Ombudsman."
"I think that our debate about the changes started at the initiative of the current Ombudsman contained two misunderstandings, which we managed, I believe, to resolve in committee."
"The first related to the subject of competences."
"Some people have said that we are giving too many competences to the European Ombudsman, but this is not true."
"This report attempts to supplement the existing institutional competences of the European Ombudsman so that he can use them appropriately in all the areas which the rapporteur has spoken about."
"The second misunderstanding was over the confidentiality of documents."
"This particular report does not state what documents the public has access to."
"It refers to the documents which the Ombudsman may see and lays down two clear rules: those documents which are sensitive, according to the regulation, may not be seen by anyone; documents subject to the confidentiality regime must continue to be subject to it."
"In conclusion, let me say that in the current circumstances it is very important for us to promote this report."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, this initiative is a timely strengthening of the Statute of the Ombudsman, and a signal of confidence in the way that Mr Diamandouros and his predecessor, Mr Söderman, have exercised their functions."
"It also reflects a change in the political climate since the inception of the Office of the Ombudsman, especially with respect to increased transparency."
"It would be palpably absurd for us as a Parliament to decline to allow the Ombudsman full access to documents on the grounds of secrecy."
"Public opinion would be bound to treat such a caveat with great cynicism."
"I agree with Commissioner Wallström that it would be splendid if we could conclude these long-standing negotiations under the Slovenian presidency, so that we are properly prepared to face voters at the elections in spring 2009."
"We should be proud of these reforms, which I believe the entire Parliament will feel able to support."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Mr Diamandouros, the Greens want to strengthen the institution of Ombudsman in order to increase public confidence in the European institutions."
"How can we do this?"
"By agreeing that the Ombudsman should have full access to all types of documents, including classified documents."
"Moreover, we are delighted that the Ombudsman is to be able to hear the testimony of officials of the European institutions who are to be free of the constraint of having always to speak in accordance with the instructions of superiors in their administration."
"That is important."
"It is also important, as mentioned in the Treaty of Lisbon and in this report, for the Ombudsman to have the power to intervene in cases before the Court of Justice, and we endorse the call made by the Ombudsman for greater transparency in general, including in this House, as regards the finances of MEPs."
"This is the second time that the European Parliament has proposed improvements to the Statute of the Ombudsman."
"On the last occasion, the Council blocked those improvements."
"I am confident that this time the actual powers of the Ombudsman have finally been clarified, and that we have genuinely created a means of increasing the confidence of the man in the street in the European institutions."
"(ES) Mr President, some of my fellow Members here are going to say: what is happening today?"
"Have we lost all sense?"
"A Committee on Constitutional Affairs item at ten to eleven at night?"
"What has happened, then?"
"Did Mr Duff strike a blow and relegate Mr Watson to the second row of the Liberal Group?"
"What did we do here in the People's Party?"
"No, all we did here was comply with the recommendation of the Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, which says that, when there are only a few of us, we should try to meet together, if only to keep warm and not feel alone."
"Seriously though, Mr President, I believe that the meeting tonight deals with an important topic."
"I am very pleased that the Ombudsman is here with us."
"This is because, as Mrs Wallström, Vice-President of the Commission, so rightly said, after a decade of operation, it is normal and right to stand back and look at what is not working and what could be improved."
"This is precisely what the report of Mrs Jäätteenmäki aims to do and I would like to thank her for working so well with us all, and for seeking a consensus which demonstrates that, here in the European institutions, we live in a consensual and not a conflictual democracy."
"So, congratulations, Mrs Jäätteenmäki."
"What we have tried to achieve, Mr President, is something very simple."
"When the position of Ombudsman was created by the Treaty of Maastricht, we were at an important crossroads between a basically economic Union and an encouragingly political Union."
"The Ombudsman was a key element in that transition."
"Today we want to continue to support the Ombudsman in his work so that he can continue to be a vital player in this rapprochement between the institutions and European citizens."
"I am therefore convinced that the reforms proposed - by consensus, I would repeat - by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs will go in that direction."
"At the next mini-plenary session we will debate the report of Mr Stubbs, who is dealing with another important aspect, transparency in the European institutions."
"Both reports are leading in the same direction, Mr President, and show that here, even at five to eleven at night, we are concerning ourselves with our citizens."
"Mr President, the European institutions are unavoidably more distant from citizens than are national or local institutions."
"That is why we have the principle of subsidiarity, which states that we should not act at European level if national or local action is perfectly adequate."
"That is also why we have an institutional system such that when we do act at European level we can offer citizens the guarantee that the institutions operate to the highest degree of openness, democracy and propriety."
"That is why we have a European Parliament, so that Europe is not just left to government ministers and technocrats, diplomats and bureaucrats."
"That is why we have the Court of Justice, to ensure the rule of law."
"That is also why we have the Ombudsman, so that even those citizens who do not follow our deliberations week in, week out - and there are many of them - can rest assured that we operate to those high standards, and that if there are allegations of maladministration then they will be properly and impartially investigated."
"However, as Commissioner Wallström said, citizens must have confidence in the Ombudsman's capacity to do that."
"Even if there have not yet been any cases of officials, when questioned by the Ombudsman, having been given instructions from 'higher-up' tantamount to censorship, and even if there have not up to now been problems of access to confidential documents, it is important that our citizens see that these things cannot become obstacles, and cannot be used as excuses to hide things from the Ombudsman."
"That is why I welcome the initiative the Ombudsman has taken in proposing changes to his statute."
"My group will be supporting the changes approved by the Constitutional Affairs Committee, and I am sure that Parliament as a whole will endorse them whole-heartedly."
"(BG) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mrs. Jäätteenmäki for that fact that since the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights were signed a new framework on the Ombudsman's role in modern social relations has been proposed."
"I am confident that this document will contribute to the more efficient execution of his duty and will make him an actual guarantor of effective protection for European citizens against cases of bad governance on the part of European institutions"
"Both our discussions and the report focus on the sensitive topic of the Ombudsman's access to information, including classified information."
"In my opinion, if the Ombudsman's work is to be done effectively and if we are to ensure the best possible result in the inquest into objective truth, which is primarily in the public interest, European institutions should have the obligation to provide access to any type of information."
"At the same time, however, the Ombudsman must be informed of the type of such information, especially in cases where it is confidential."
"Indeed, it is very important to respect citizens' privacy, particularly when using classified information."
"I think that the rapporteur has managed to strike a balance between personal rights and public interest."
"This provides the Ombudsman with access to the entire information on a given case, so that he or she can rule on it while at the same time there is compliance with all rules which are followed also by those institutions providing such information, and this will ensure both the protection of the information involved and the protection of European citizens' rights."
"Strengthening the Ombudsman's role as a mediator between the European institutions and the citizens will make a contribution to the development of democracy and reinforce the principles of rule of law."
"That is why it is very important that he or she is present not only at the European but at the national level as well, especially in countries where democratic principles and supervision are still in the process of being built and where government structures cannot provide effective remedy for their citizens at the national level, yet those citizens are also citizens of the European Union."
"That is why I would like to stress on the need to improve cooperation between the EU institutions and the Ombudsman."
"Contacts between the Ombudsman and Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament are particularly important; they need to cooperate in the interest of European citizens."
"It is also important to develop and implement a more effective system of practical mechanisms for cooperation."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Jäätteenmäki's report comes at a very important time in the process of European integration: the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The acknowledgement, for the first time, of the right of the citizens of Europe to a good administration constitutes significant progress towards greater transparency and meets the need for the actions and the behaviour of Community bodies to comply not only with the rules in force but also with the expectations of the European taxpayer as regards a responsible, impartial and efficient administration."
"The proposed changes would make it possible, during an investigation, to overcome any unwillingness on the part of the Community institutions to cooperate fully in the clarification of the facts."
"Any possible willingness to gloss over certain aspects of the truth by adopting vague texts whose wording is open to ambiguous interpretation cannot be tolerated."
"This allows an administration far too much latitude and increases its discretionary powers in a disproportionate and unacceptable manner."
"The Ombudsman needs the confidence of the citizens who expect him to intervene judiciously in the protection of their rights."
"However, he is also duty bound to respect the confidentiality of the information that he receives."
"For this reason, I congratulate Mrs Jäätteenmäki for having struck an appropriate balance between these two requirements and for having proposed balanced solutions that strengthen the effectiveness of the role of the Ombudsman as a moral authority and improve the transparency of the Community institutions, confirming, in the spirit of the new Charter, the right of every European citizen to good governance and a good administration."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank the honourable Members for this discussion and their remarks."
"Many Members have mentioned that this is an issue of competencies and also of confidentiality."
"Those two issues are linked, and I am sure that these reforms will remove the ambiguities that institutions might, on occasion, have used to hide behind."
"The reforms will modernise and open up procedures and ensure greater clarity and transparency, which is necessary in these times and in order to meet citizens' expectations."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms Jäätteenmäki once again for working in an open and constructive way with us, and for informing us on her work."
"I would also like to thank the Ombudsman himself, because I have had the opportunity to follow his work, and am aware of the level of correctness, seriousness and commitment with which he carries out his tasks."
"It has really impressed me, and I have great confidence in him."
"By this initiative we are also helping the Ombudsman align his statute with what we would expect from the Ombudsman in his examination of cases of maladministration within our institutions."
"rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, I just want to thank everyone for their excellent cooperation and at this final review stage I hope that we will find the right wording so that there is greater confidence as a result of EU acts, that there will be adequate resources in place and that the Ombudsman can be provided with all necessary information."
"If not, as I said, it will be a bad day for the rule of law and for transparency, although I believe that a common view will be found, because now there are only a few minor changes to make."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 22 April 2008."
"New Flame shipwreck and its consequences in Algeciras Bay (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the New Flame shipwreck and the pollution in Algeciras Bay."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I am pleased to be here today to inform you of the Commission statement in connection with the resolution that you are going to adopt on the New Flame shipwreck and its consequences in Algeciras Bay."
"This resolution refers to two matters of great importance to European citizens: maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment, that is, the protection of our coastlines, our bays and our beaches."
"Europe has had to cope with ecological disasters caused by accidents at sea, such as the Erika and the Prestige."
"The New Flame shipwreck has had serious consequences, but it has not caused a disaster of such magnitude."
"Nevertheless, this shipwreck reminded us that maritime transport could be dangerous and that such incidents could still occur despite the numerous measures taken by the European Union over the past few decades."
"The European Commission has monitored the accident very closely; it has remained vigilant with regard to the application of Community law, and it now wishes to put forward a number of practical proposals aimed at further improving maritime safety."
"The Commission has very closely monitored this accident, which occurred in August 2007."
"The Commission's services, in particular the Monitoring and Information Centre of the Environment Directorate-General, responsible for civil protection, have been in contact with the Spanish authorities, the ASMAR Sociedad Estatal de Salvamento y Seguridad Maritima and the British authorities."
"In response to requests by the Spanish authorities, we have provided, through the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA, various satellite images in order to detect any potential oil pollution in Algeciras Bay."
"In addition, Spain decided to request, through the Monitoring and Information Centre, the mobilisation of one of the EMSA-contracted oil recovery vessels."
"This pollution response vessel, the Mistra Bay, is still on site, ready to assist on the basis of instructions given by the Spanish authorities."
"These two EMSA services, namely the CleanSeaNet satellite-based monitoring system and the oil recovery vessels, were created by European legislation."
"It is thanks to the support of the European Parliament that EUR 154 million have been allocated to combat pollution for the period 2007-2013."
"Moreover, EMSA has recently concluded contracts with other oil recovery vessels in order to provide Europe's coasts with even better protection, and, in the very near future, two new vessels, the Bahia Uno and the Bahia Tres, will be operating out of Algeciras Bay."
"In general, the Commission is responsible for ensuring that the existing body of EU legislation in the field of maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment is properly applied."
"EMSA was established to assist the Commission in enforcing and implementing the existing body of EU legislation."
"Inspections carried out by the Agency enable an assessment of the steps taken by the Member States to comply with Community law."
"Where appropriate, the Commission may initiate infringement proceedings against any Member State that fails to transpose Community law correctly."
"In the aforementioned fields, several matters are pending, including what is commonly known as the directive on criminal penalties and the directive on environmental liability."
"The practical application of the provisions of the penal code and the prosecution of polluters nevertheless remain a matter for the individual Member States."
"I should like to come back to the matter of the New Flame."
"The Commission is currently considering a complaint received from the Andalusian Regional Government regarding a possible failure to comply with Community legislation."
"It should be remembered that the third maritime package, under discussion today, aims to make further improvements in the area of vessel traffic monitoring and the liability of maritime transport operators."
"In conclusion, the Commission would point out that the European Union has implemented ambitious policies for maritime safety and for the protection of the marine environment."
"Accordingly, any Member State affected by an accident has at its disposal, should it so wish, effective tools to combat polluters and pollution."
"The Commission hopes that the wreck of the New Flame is soon removed from Algeciras Bay."
"The arrival of the specialist barge Big Foot 1 in late March suggests that further attempts are being planned."
"That concludes the information that I wished to give to Parliament."
"Mr President, I shall now listen carefully to what Members have to say on this subject."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, it is eight months since the shipwreck of the New Flame and there is still a risk of further oil spills, especially oil emanating from the cargo contained in the wreck."
"This situation has arisen due to factors which are daily occurrences in that area, failure to manage high-density traffic and massive oil transfer operations between vessels at sea."
"However, in this particular case, there has also been a chain of errors and abandonment of responsibility, in terms of monitoring of the vessel as well as after the collision."
"Therefore, Commissioner, this Parliament would be glad if you could answer the following four questions:"
"One, do you have any information on the origin and degree of toxicity of the 42 500 tonnes of scrap metal not recovered?"
"Two, can you tell us whether, following the collision and over these last eight months, there has been recourse to the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection and if so how many times?"
"Three, do you know of any plans and time schedules to refloat the vessel - to which you referred just now - or of any plans to monitor the risk of contamination being released from its cargo?"
"Four, the European Commission has opened an inquiry."
"Is this to establish whether the competent authorities breached the Community rules in force?"
"If so, Mr Barrot, if there has been a breach of Community law, please give this House an undertaking that you will refer those infringements to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, because when all is said and done it is always citizens and the environment who pay."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I should like to think that we are all concerned about protecting the environment and maritime safety, and that is the only reason for dragging the New Flame incident into our debate."
"I cannot believe that anyone could maintain that this case is even remotely comparable to the Prestige catastrophe."
"The spillage from the New Flame has only amounted to 24 tonnes to date, compared with more than 70 000 tonnes from the Prestige."
"It would be like comparing a scratch to terminal cancer; however, an incident such as this is never a minor matter."
"We need to reinforce the mechanisms for preventing and managing certain risks on our seas, especially in the Mediterranean."
"There is no doubt that the Spanish authorities acted calmly, efficiently and competently, perhaps because they have learnt from the serious chain of errors and stupidities committed by the government at the time of the Prestige disaster."
"This action on the part of the Spanish Government and the Junta de Andalucía was facilitated by the European Maritime Safety Agency and the services of CleanSeaNet, which provided the Spanish authorities with eleven satellite images and two incident assessment reports, and the Commission response was mentioned by Mr Barrot just now so I will not repeat it."
"Nine months after the incident the matter is under control and the British and Spanish authorities, together with the Commission, are acting strictly within the framework of the Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the oral question that underlies this debate smacks to me of atavistic resentment of a constitutional nature. This House is at its worst if we allow such sentiment to stain our approach to the politics of the European Union."
"I would ask the Commissioner to clarify three points for us, and I hope he will come back at the end of the debate and do that."
"First, that the collision and sinking of the New Flame happened not in the Bay of Gibraltar, which the Spanish call the Bay of Algeciras, but on the south-east side of the Rock of Gibraltar, off Europa Point in the Mediterranean Sea."
"Second, that the New Flame incident had nothing to do with the bunkering of oil, as the ship was carrying scrap metal."
"Third, that there have not been seven oil spills, as claimed in the oral question, but one minor spill during a storm on 9-10 February."
"Seven hundred and eighty cubic metres of fuel were pumped off the vessel in the month following the incident, none of which was spilt."
"I would be grateful if the Commissioner would confirm that to the House."
"If there is oil on the coast, it is more likely to have come from the Sierra Nava, which broke anchor in a storm earlier in the year, ran aground and leaked oil."
"Perhaps the Commissioner would also comment on the cooperation between the Gibraltar authorities and the Spanish authorities."
"I believe that cooperation was exemplary."
"Gibraltar is in compliance with all its relevant international obligations, and I would invite my Spanish colleagues, particularly from the Partido Popular, to come with me to that part of my constituency, talk to the authorities and take a look at the wreck."
"There are indeed legitimate concerns over maritime safety and the danger of pollution, not just at sea, but also of the air and of groundwater, in the busy, heavily-populated industrial area in which Gibraltar and its Spanish hinterland are found."
"However, let us not allow the party-political devices of a disappointed opposition to colour our European considerations."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I think that this New Flame situation was best summed up by Greenpeace when it planted a banner on the wreck bearing the slogan 'vertido diplomático' - diplomatic spillage."
"The problem is in fact twofold: there is the ecological problem and then there is the diplomatic problem."
"However, the latter cannot be used as an excuse for not tackling the former seriously."
"For example, the New Flame incident is symptomatic of the chronic oil pollution of the Bay of Algeciras due to the failure of Gibraltar to comply with European legislation and also the excessive permissiveness of the Spanish authorities."
"In any case, I should like to highlight, or perhaps I should be grateful for, the sudden ecological concern of fellow Members in the Partido Popular."
"I get the feeling, at any rate, that the interest in the New Flame is not so much to do with the need to tackle the ecological problem as with creating the internal opposition to which we are so accustomed."
"To reiterate, I believe that there is a diplomatic problem but the fundamental problem is an ecological one which must be tackled immediately."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, since August I have taken part in various Parliamentary initiatives and have made various speeches in this plenary."
"The basic issue - as we all know - is that the area around the Straits is one of the busiest areas in Europe for maritime traffic with more than 100 000 vessels per annum, 30 000 of which anchor in the area between the Bay of Algeciras and Gibraltar."
"The underlying problem is that these two ports have no body to coordinate and monitor maritime traffic."
"That is the basic problem."
"We are launching a clear and precise initiative so that the two Member States involved in this matter can resolve this lack of coordination as soon as possible."
"We are talking about two ports with the greatest volume of maritime traffic and it is unacceptable, in this day and age, that there is still no monitoring entity."
"We are not just talking about the New Flame, we also had the Sierra Nava and the Samotraki, and these are incidents which obviously threaten maritime safety, the safety of persons and the natural environment."
"Therefore, I think that Europe must take the initiative and give the Member States a clear directive."
"It is unacceptable, in the 21st century, for the vessel still to be in its current condition."
"Perhaps Spain was wrong to entrust salvage of the vessel to Gibraltar?"
"Perhaps the two administrations should have done it jointly?"
"I have a substantive matter to put to the Commissioner."
"I put a question to the Commission - which Mr Dimas answered in March - highlighting an issue which is still not clear, namely what the vessel was carrying in its hold."
"What type of scrap metal was it carrying?"
"The Commission replied saying that it was carrying 700 tonnes of IFO-380 fuel but we still do not know what type of scrap metal."
"I think that this is unacceptable."
"I call on the Commission to tell us once and for all what type of scrap metal the vessel was carrying."
"(PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking in this debate because the situation of the New Flame, shipwrecked in Algeciras Bay and Gibraltar in August 2007, has yet to be resolved."
"As is well known, there were several spillages of fuel and oil from the vessel between August 2007 and February 2008."
"We all know that the consequences of this kind of accident have no respect for the borders of states and harm both the environment and coastal populations."
"I therefore add my voice to those of my Spanish colleagues who are asking for a response to the questions raised about New Flame."
"These are relevant questions and require an urgent response because this accident not only concerns the Spanish and Gibraltar authorities."
"It is the kind of accident that has consequences for the environment, maritime safety and the maritime economy, and therefore affects all of us."
"We cannot ignore the fact that the collision and sinking of this vessel took place in one of the busiest sea routes in the world and that its cargo has still not been unloaded."
"The diplomatic quarrel is therefore the least of our worries."
"However, the issues raised are all the more relevant when we consider that this Parliament has just approved legislation on maritime safety in a package of measures that aims to strengthen European legislation and harmonise it with important international instruments."
"It therefore makes sense for us to ask how the relevant resources approved by European legislation are being used, at least those that are already available, and how the necessary cooperation between Member States and the Commission is being coordinated, particularly with regard to the exchange of information, the allocation of responsibilities and the practical measures required to resolve the situation."
"It is in this context, moreover, that we evaluate the statement that Vice-President Barrot has made to us here and that I understand communicates the Commission's position."
"(ES) Mr President, this debate and the answers from the Commissioner have left no doubt that the Spanish and Andalucian authorities are highly sensitive to spillages of pollutants and maritime safety; these are important matters for the Spanish Government both in terms of its response, which was fairly immediate in terms of time and manner, and because it has embarked upon a series of very large-scale actions to resolve the problem and to avoid even worse disasters."
"We have already talked about this."
"Clearly the New Flame incident is not remotely a catastrophe on the scale of the Prestige, but its consequences have occupied and concerned the Spanish Government, the government of my country."
"The Spanish Government certainly cannot be accused of inaction, quite the reverse."
"Right from the time of the incident, Spain has been in contact with the United Kingdom and with Gibraltar and has been seeking information on the vessel and on the collision, and it has offered to collaborate in and coordinate the initiative proposed by my fellow Member, Mr Meyer Pleite."
"As the Commissioner said, assistance has been sought from the European Union since August."
"The ship-owner and his company have been instructed to bear the cost of the damage and the Junta de Andalucía has also made a complaint to Gibraltar for potentially failing to comply with legislation."
"It is vital for Spain to have fulfilled its obligations - which it did, and there was no repeat of what happened with the Prestige - but there is also a need for coordination and it is that coordination which was found wanting."
"Therefore, I believe that Spain's recourse to the Forum of Dialogue on Gibraltar as a measure which can genuinely enable us to manage such situations and prevent further undesirable incidents should conclude this matter for us all."
"Everything else is just the apathy which some people felt and want to drag through Parliament again."
"(ES) Mr President, as far as the Greens are concerned, it is not a matter of apportioning blame, but of seeking an effective means of remedying a catastrophe such as this, or rather the chronicle of catastrophes which occur daily in the Straits of Gibraltar."
"This collision was a grave warning and we should take note."
"We have asked the Commission to adopt measures to combat the foolhardy and dangerous practice of bunkering which is turning the waters of Gibraltar, Great Britain and Spain into an enormous, lawless, floating petrol station, without supervision or safeguards."
"Hundreds of dubious single-hulled vessels sail these seas."
"Last year there were six thousand fuel transhipments, more than ten thousand of them on the high seas, without the safety measures laid down in the Marpol Convention."
"We have told the European Commission that we cannot continue learning from disasters and have asked it to submit a protocol to this House, an effective protocol on maritime transport collaboration in the Straits of Gibraltar, in defence of the environment and common sense."
"We cannot cope with this sort of catastrophe on top of our everyday disasters."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Barrot for his answers."
"Algeciras Bay has become the dumping ground of the Straits of Gibraltar."
"In addition to unlawful bunkering practices, the continual spillage of pollutants, albeit in small quantities, and accidents involving spillage of cargo are threatening to transform a protected area into a sewer."
"The case we are debating in no way threatens relations between Spain and Great Britain, who are discussing their old grievances in a rational manner."
"In the case of the New Flame - if you will permit me to use the saying - 'unos por otros, la casa sin barrer' - 'a hedge between keeps friendship green'."
"It is scandalous that in six long months no competent authority has been capable of taking effective decisions to prevent the vessel sinking and that polluting spillages resulting from the collision have not been prevented."
"The wreck is now at the bottom of the sea along with 42 500 tonnes of scrap whose nature and potential for pollution is unknown."
"Commissioner, we are working hard on the Erika III package, which the Council is showing little inclination to tailor to Parliament's demands, to ensure that there is an independent authority to combat maritime pollution, an authority which has the power to take decisions after assessing the scale of an incident."
"This New Flame case seems tailor-made to justify the establishment of just such an independent authority, equipped with decision-making powers."
"Moreover, it is inexcusable to urge the Member States of the European Union to transpose the relevant directives and to ratify the international conventions applicable to this case."
"It was sad to hear Andalucía being slated over the major disaster of the Prestige; it is a sad Manichaean game which shows little respect for Andalucía."
"It is a shame that it was people from that region who brought the matter up."
"Commissioner, what Andalucía demands is that legitimate bunkering and maritime activities in the Bay of Alegeciras, which generate wealth and employment for the area, should go hand in hand with strict respect for environmental protection."
"(ES) Mr President, this accident is certainly not comparable to other incidents involving oil tankers, or even container vessels such as the Napoli, on which the IMB still has to take a decision."
"On the other hand, we should be very pleased that the Vice-President is taking part in this debate."
"At the moment the debate is focused essentially on environmental aspects."
"I think it is important that Mr Barrot has the power to tackle both aspects, the environment and transport, with new instruments."
"We settled the diplomatic problems with Gibraltar over safety in the air."
"I would like to suggest to Mr Barrot that here too we should try to settle, and indeed improve, the diplomatic aspects with Gibraltar over maritime safety."
"Despite problems, I believe that there are already channels for dialogue which can prove very useful."
"I also believe that the Spanish and Andalucian authorities have done everything possible in connection with this type of accident in this critical area of the Mediterranean, and of course we are pleased and gratified to see that they immediately asked the European Union to enforce the instruments available to it."
"We firmly believe in the importance of sending out a message of hope to citizens as regards the gloomier aspects, and we should therefore encourage you to reinforce those EMSA mechanisms which proved to be useful precautionary, and then protective, measures for the coastline, to press ahead with this third maritime safety package and, in particular, to improve cooperation between ports, which was perhaps not always as good as it might have been, and certainly to present all those aspects relating to improving the quality of marine fuel, a proposal which was agreed recently by the IMO and will certainly improve the outcome or consequences of this type of incident."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I will attempt to reply to a few of the questions."
"I should like to say to Mr Galeote that the Commission has not been notified of any specific toxicity of the scrap metal that the New Flame was carrying on board."
"We have no grounds for believing that the metal is particularly toxic."
"As for the assistance provided through the Community Mechanism for Civil Protection, this was requested by the Spanish authorities immediately after the incident involving the New Flame had occurred, but it has not been requested since."
"Finally, with regard to the removal of the wreck, I should like to inform Parliament that salvage operations are under way, sea conditions currently allowing them to be carried out safely."
"These removal operations are expected to take approximately three months."
"Moreover, the Commission is considering the complaint received from the Andalusian Government."
"Any infringements that are found to have taken place will be prosecuted."
"Mr Watson also asked me a few questions."
"I should like to say to him that the wreck of the New Flame is, indeed, located in the territorial waters of Gibraltar."
"The New Flame incident had nothing to do with the bunkering of oil; the British authorities informed the Commission that oil bunkering activities were regulated under existing law and that they did not pose any particular problems."
"Supply vessels are always double-hulled oil tankers and have all the necessary certificates."
"Mr Meyer, the vessel traffic monitoring directive - I shall conclude on this point - promotes cooperation in the area of vessel traffic monitoring, while the SafeSeaNet information system allows for the exchange of information."
"Mr Queiró, the Commission believes that the provisions of the directive on criminal penalties for maritime pollution may be applicable in the case of the New Flame, as well as, more generally, to bunkering operations that cause pollution at sea."
"However, the 2005 directive does not lay down the legislative framework for imposing criminal penalties on persons responsible for maritime pollution."
"The practical imposition of penalties in each individual case is not provided for in the directive but under the applicable national law, for instance, following the submission of a complaint or after initiating criminal action."
"Penalties must be imposed by the national courts as soon as an offence is found to have been committed."
"Mr Hammerstein, the open-sea transfer of oil is a very common practice in maritime transport."
"In principle, this does not pose a problem as long as all precautionary measures are taken."
"Shipowners have developed a body of best practices for bunkering operations, that is, during the supply of fuel to vessels."
"For its part, the International Maritime Organisation is preparing to adopt various measures to prevent pollution during the transfer of oil between tankers."
"The Member States and the Commission have actively supported this approach; we will, however, remain extremely vigilant in this area."
"Mr de Grandes Pascual, in 2005, as part of the third package of legislative measures on maritime safety, the Commission tabled a proposal for a directive laying down a minimum set of common rules on civil liability and insurance."
"This proposal was welcomed by the European Parliament, but, unfortunately, no appropriate action has so far been taken in the Council."
"This proposal was designed to provide an interim response to the victims of maritime pollution prior to the constantly delayed implementation of the international conventions that are pending."
"Such conventions either enter into force only after much delay or are not applicable in all the Member States."
"That leads to situations of unequal treatment for maritime transport operators and for accident victims."
"I have not replied to all questions, but I should also like to tell you that the Commission is aware that there is ongoing disagreement over the territorial waters of Gibraltar."
"It is not our place to get involved in this discussion."
"We can only call on the parties concerned to strengthen their cooperation and improve the exchange of information."
"The Tripartite Forum should focus on the issue of cooperation in the field of maritime safety."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you would allow me, I should like to take this opportunity to tell you that, with regard to the Third Maritime Package to prevent pollution, Parliament has really faced up to its responsibilities."
"Your Committee on Transport has adopted all seven proposals, and I must pay tribute to Parliament, which has provided me with much assistance in this matter."
"Nevertheless, it is true that, at the last meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers, I did notice that there was some resistance on the part of a number of Member States, several Member States, towards two proposals: on the one hand, the proposal on civil liability, the liability of shipowners, in connection with which, in particular, we have had to introduce a compulsory insurance scheme that is obviously critically important for the future."
"On the other hand, a further proposal, which supplements this scheme, on the liability of the flag State."
"The liability of the flag State is essential if we want all European flags to appear on the white list of the Paris Memorandum, demonstrating that they are all quality flags."
"However, we are not quite there yet."
"I should like to say that, in order to prevent shipwrecks such as that of the New Flame, it is imperative that we have legislation that is, as we have proposed in the Third Maritime Package, comprehensive and capable of effectively eliminating, at any stage, the risk of accidents at sea and pollution."
"In this instance, we have made progress, there is no doubt about it."
"The Maritime Safety Agency, as I have already demonstrated, has provided assistance."
"It has recently strengthened its pollution response vessel network; however, nothing can take the place of this Third Maritime Package with regard to which I can only hope that, with, I realise, the full backing of Parliament, the Member States are prepared to face up to their responsibilities."
"What a dramatic situation we would have on our hands if, tomorrow, an oil spill were to occur in the highly fragile and sensitive waters of the Mediterranean Sea."
"For this reason, I should like to thank you again for your full support so that this Third Maritime Package may be effectively implemented and so that we may have effective flag State control and clear accountability on the part of shipowners."
"It is absolutely vital if we want to prevent disasters of this kind."
"In any event, thank you for raising this issue, which provides us with an opportunity to highlight once again the absolute necessity of maritime safety."
"(ES) Mr President, a point of order."
"The Commissioner referred to the waters of Gibraltar."
"I do not know whether this was an interpreting mistake or a lapse on the part of the Commissioner."
"I would like him to be clear about this because, as he perfectly well knows, the ownership of those waters is the subject of a dispute between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom."
"I would like him to clarify this, please."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I did not wish to take a position on this."
"I simply gave the geographical location of the shipwreck as being Algeciras, Gibraltar."
"Please do not misunderstand me: I did not wish to settle a dispute that I am, moreover, incapable of settling."
"Mr President, the Commissioner was absolutely right."
"This is in the territorial waters of Gibraltar, and it should go on the record that neither the incident nor the sinking of the New Flame was in the Bay of Gibraltar or Algeciras, however you call it."
"It was off the south-eastern tip of the rock in the Mediterranean Sea, and that should be clear on the record here."
"I have received six motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rule of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 24 April 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (NL) The matter of the New Flame shipwreck off Gibraltar seems to be centred primarily on the dispute between the United Kingdom and Spain over Gibraltar."
"It is most important that diplomatic sabre-rattling should not outweigh the threat of an environmental disaster off the Spanish coast."
"That, after all, is the real problem."
"Priority must always be given to safeguarding the environment."
"Then there is the problem of liability."
"For the umpteenth time we have here a vessel which sails under a flag of convenience in order to avoid complying with laws and paying dues and then gets into trouble."
"The EU should be able to act to prevent this flouting of international rules."
"It has to be crystal-clear who is liable in the event of accidents like this."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"

"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)"

"2006 Annual report of the EIB (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jean-Pierre Audy on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the European Investment Bank's annual report for 2006."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, President of the European Investment Bank, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will be to thank you, Mr Maystadt, for the excellent relationship you have built up with the MEPs on the Committee on Budgetary Control, which has made a significant contribution to enabling the report we are about to debate to be written."
"I would extend these thanks to your team of staff, and especially, Philippe de Fontaine Vive, Vice-President, with whom I was able to work in complete transparency at the Bank's headquarters in Luxembourg."
"You carry out your role, Mr Maystadt, with a great deal of competence, warmth, determination and courage, but also with wisdom and, I would add, with elegance."
"The EIB, which was set up by the Treaty of Rome, celebrates its fiftieth anniversary in 2008."
"Its members are the European Union Member States, and their finance ministers form its board of governors."
"Its mission is to contribute to the development of the common market, using the capital markets and its own funds."
"It is a Community instrument, but within it power is exercised intergovernmentally."
"It is a good thing that citizens' representatives are talking about these issues at a time when citizens themselves are demanding results from the European Union; they often benefit from the EIB's services without realising it."
"First I would like to congratulate the Bank for its action, its ambitious plan of activities and projects;"
"I particularly welcome the excellence of the new strategy for 2007-2009 including transparency, the reinforcement of added value and the gradual increase in risk-taking, activities for the benefit of SMEs and local government, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the European Commission."
"The important role of the Bank in the neighbourhood policy should also be underlined, and the report calls more specifically for further development of the facility for Euro-Mediterranean investment and partnership, or FEMIP, within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"I believe, however, that the time has come to go even further, faster and better, in terms of both control and support for the European Union in financing its investments."
"In terms of control mechanisms, I think the time has come to set up genuine control of banking regulation, and I suggest that the EIB itself apply to the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, based in London, to look at the conditions for this task of regulation and in particular decide who could carry it out in the regrettable absence of an official European banking regulator."
"Concerning support for the European Union in financing investment, where needs have been estimated at EUR 600 billion for the trans-European transport networks alone, I suggest that a reflection be carried out on the role of the European Union in terms of the development of our territory."
"The funding allocated by the Member States and the EU is far from able to meet these needs."
"Is it not understandable, Commissioner, that the European Union should have difficulty finding EUR 3.4 billion to finance as strategic a project from an industrial, scientific and military point of view as Galileo, under these circumstances?"
"I suggest that, given the quality of the EIB's human resources, its detachment and its experience of financing major infrastructure, the Commission gives it the task of carrying out a strategic study on the funding of investments, excluding no possible scenarios: subsidies, payment of sums subscribed by the Member States to the EIB's capital, loans (including special loans from the Member States as provided for in Article 6 of the EIB's Statute), innovative instruments such as risk sharing, loan guarantee instruments, financial engineering appropriate to long-term projects that are not immediately profitable according to market-based financial criteria, creation of an investment section within the European Union budget, financial consortia between European, national and local authorities, public-private partnerships, etc."
"These, Mr President, Mr Maystadt, ladies and gentlemen, are the ideas put forward in this report."
"I look forward to hearing the debate that will follow and thank you for your attention."
"Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Audy, who has produced and just presented to us an excellent report on the annual report of the European Investment Bank for 2006."
"I think that, as the report reflects, the productive dialogue established between the European Investment Bank and Parliament in recent years is very important, as it benefits democratic transparency, which is very important to both Parliament and to the financial institution."
"The EIB contributes significantly to launching and developing many European policies, and we should therefore welcome the quality of this dialogue, which is undoubtedly being strengthened with Philippe Maystadt at the bank's helm."
"The activity of the European Investment Bank is also being strengthened through the new financial framework, with the new financial perspectives for the European Union for the 2007-2013 period."
"Obviously we are debating the 2006 report."
"The progress of these perspectives in this initial period of 15 or 16 months is not yet covered by the report, but with the new funding instruments launched thanks to these new perspectives, this cooperation will continue to take place and to become more ambitious and effective in many fields: in policies on research and development, regional development, trans-European networks, support for small and medium-sized enterprises, etc."
"Also, with regard to the external actions of the European Investment Bank, on the basis of these financial perspectives the new EIB external mandate has already been adopted."
"It is not only in the Bank itself, but within the European Investment Bank group that cooperation is also being increased, with the European Investment Fund."
"Proof of this, for example, is the Jeremy programme."
"In addition, we are satisfied with the tripartite agreement between the European Investment Bank, the EBRD, which is the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the Commission, for actions by each of them in countries bordering the European Union to the east, and also with the development of the new FEMIP, which Mr Audy referred to, which is doing a great deal of work, and these are examples of an increasingly close link between the activities of the Bank and the external activities of the European Union."
"Mr Audy's report highlights, and in my view rightly so, the potential of the European Investment Bank for developing innovative funding instruments that are capable of having an enormous effect in terms of increasing the resources available in the European budget for implementing a whole series of policies."
"The Commission is aware of this potential."
"Not only have we already made some agreements with the European Investment Bank, which have been approved by the Council and Parliament, to do more with the same budgetary resources in areas such as trans-European networks or research and development policy, but also, in the context of the review of the Community budget that we will propose at the end of 2008 or the beginning of 2009 for debate, we are looking at extending these new funding mechanisms, and the resulting increase in capacity for action through the budgetary resources available, to other priority areas such as energy and climate change."
"With regard to the mechanisms for cooperation with the Bank, I would also like to inform you that we are already finalising the negotiations with the Bank on a new memorandum of understanding to cover all of our cooperation relations, and we hope that it will enable these relations to be even more effective."
"I cannot give a response to the suggestion from the rapporteur, Mr Audy, whose concern I share, regarding what the right solution is for the European Investment Bank to be supervised as a financial institution."
"I do not have the solution, but I think this is a very pertinent question, on which we should all cooperate in order to provide a suitable response."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to reiterate the Commission's satisfaction with this high level of cooperation between Parliament and the European Investment Bank, and I hope that in the future this will enable all of us - all the European institutions - to contribute to better achieving the Union's objectives."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (BG) The report is an example of good cooperation between the European Parliament and this financial institution which has the task to contribute for a balanced and sound development of the Community by using capital market tools and its own resources."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his good presentation of the European Investment Bank, his reasonable suggestions aimed at enhancing cooperation, efficiency and transparency of operations."
"The Bank's report lists ample examples of achievement in terms of the main goals and priorities of the Union such as the geographic allocation of investments, strategic direction and project applications."
"Future efforts should focus on several areas such as to encourage private business to implement investment policies, including social responsibility projects in line with the EU social cohesion and territorial balance policy; to identify internal audit and internal control mechanisms; to set up offices in the new Member States; and to establish new financing mechanisms."
"I support the amendments made in plenary which deal with more stringent control over capital."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Maystadt, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has made a number of recommendations and I agree with three of them."
"I would also like to ask Mr Maystadt to respond to this in his reply."
"We are happy that the European Investment Bank operates a zero tolerance policy with regard to fraud and corruption."
"The European Parliament would actually like to further reinforce that policy."
"We recommend measures, for example, for implementing an exclusion mechanism with regard to companies that are suspected or have been found guilty of corruption."
"We support a reinforcement of the policy on whistleblowers and we are in favour of a revision of the existing tendering procedures."
"What does Mr Maystadt think of these?"
"A second element: many billions of euros are invested in trans-European networks."
"As the European Parliament, we should seek to support those projects in particular that have a smaller or negative CO2 footprint."
"Finally, with regard to external loan operations, we would like supervision to be exercised to ensure that such activities, particularly on the African continent, are in keeping with the European consensus with regard to development and also the millennium objectives."
"As President of the European Investment Bank, how does Mr Maystadt respond to Parliament's recommendations?"
"(NL) Mr President, we applaud the fact that this report emphasises the EIB's zero tolerance policy with regard to fraud and corruption and also highlights the increasing number of investigations being conducted by OLAF."
"However, experience in contracting loans has shown us that the EIB is not without sin."
"Recently, for instance, a loan of EUR 100 billion to a large-scale mining project in Congo came under heavy criticism owing to all kinds of major irregularities, such as a lack of transparency in the negotiation process and in the final award of the contract."
"There was a serious conflict of interest."
"Since 2000, the European Investment Bank has already invested more than EUR 700 million in all manner of mining projects in Africa."
"What I would like to stress here is that these many millions come from European taxpayers and that our institution's loan and contract policy must therefore also be subject to the most thorough supervision possible, particularly when funding projects outside Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, President Maystadt, I would like to congratulate Mr Audy, because he made the point very well that trans-European networks have particular significance for us."
"I can imagine that, in this respect, the EIB also provides an incentive instrument for ownership unbundling."
"We now have the Commission's proposals before us, that is, to increase the focus on ownership unbundling in the energy and telecommunications sector."
"My suggestion would be to concentrate on creating incentives here rather than focusing on making statutory obligations."
"My second point is that the export industry is currently having difficulty in maintaining its performance, especially now the euro is strong."
"Would it not be possible to focus on special programmes to provide guaranteed support for the export performance of our European businesses?"
"President of the European Investment Bank. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me first of all to thank you for giving me the chance once again to continue our dialogue with the European Parliament."
"I think it is important that an institution like the EIB should regularly have to explain itself to the representatives of EU citizens."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Audy for his report."
"I can bear witness to the fact that he has put a great deal of personal effort into writing this report."
"He took part in many working meetings both in Brussels and Luxembourg, thereby taking up the constructive dialogue we began with his predecessors."
"In his presentation this morning, he highlighted two points."
"The first issue is one we have already talked about in previous reports - I remember Mr Schmidt's report and Mr Lipietz's report - and it is the issue of whether the European Investment Bank, because it is a bank, should be subject to banking control or supervision."
"This is not provided for as the texts currently stand."
"There are, of course, audits of the European Investment Bank: the audit by the Court of Auditors, to the extent that the EIB uses EU funds, and also the audit by the audit committee, composed of experts appointed by the governors, who report directly to our governors."
"It is true, however, that, if we want to apply the best banking practices to the EIB, it would undoubtedly be desirable for a specialist body to check that these practices are correctly applied to the EIB."
"Theoretically, we can think of three possible avenues."
"The first is written into the Treaty of Maastricht, in Article 105(6)."
"This would be the possibility of the European Central Bank exercising this supervisory role."
"The Treaty states that the Council, acting unanimously, may confer a prudential supervision role on the European Central Bank."
"This is an avenue that exists theoretically but realistically it is doubtful whether the Member States, at the moment at least, would be unanimous in conferring this new role on the European Central Bank."
"Another possibility is the one we have embarked on informally, namely calling on a national regulator."
"At the moment it is the Luxembourg regulator, the Supervisory Council of the Luxembourg financial sector, which also performs this role in relation to the European Investment Bank, particularly when it comes to checking Basel II is being applied correctly."
"A third avenue for exploration would be to strengthen the audit committee provided for in our Statute, and to convert it into a quasi-banking supervisor."
"The Reform Treaty provides for the enlargement of the audit committee."
"A first step might be to appoint a number of banking supervisors, who would bring to the audit committee the necessary experience to check that the EIB is actually applying best practices in this matter."
"The second point highlighted by Mr Audy was the special role he would like to see the European Investment Bank play in infrastructure, particularly the trans-European networks."
"As you know, the EIB already plays a relatively important role in this."
"Last year, we financed the trans-European networks to the tune of nearly EUR 9 billion."
"We use various instruments, including our structured finance facility, which allows us to take more risks than is generally the rule."
"For example, we recently did this for a motorway in Greece."
"This is a good concrete example of the use of this particular facility to encourage the private sector to take more risks with the operation of a motorway."
"With the European Commission very recently, we developed a new guarantee mechanism to cover a particular type of risk, the risk of insufficient traffic during the first few years of operation of an item of infrastructure."
"Experience has shown that the first four or five years are often the trickiest."
"These are the years when income is not necessarily at the level hoped for."
"This causes problems for private operators, so to encourage the private sector to take on the financing of such infrastructure regardless of this problem, in conjunction with the Commission we have developed a new guarantee mechanism."
"I would add that the European Investment Bank has taken the initiative of setting up a European expertise centre in public-private partnerships to share our experience in this area with national representatives."
"Mr Audy, this is certainly an area in which the EIB is eager to continue its action."
"Mr Staes asked a question about the anti-fraud policy."
"We have just published our anti-fraud policy following a consultation procedure that required several rounds of talks."
"In relation to the specific question he raised, about a debarment system that would prohibit companies guilty of fraud or corruption from continuing to participate in projects we were financing, we announce in this policy that we hope to be able to use the same system that the Commission is attempting to set up."
"If we could not - and we should know this by the end of the year - if, for legal reasons, we could not use the same system, then we would set up our own debarment system."
"As regards our financing in the energy sector, we have reviewed our policy on financing energy projects in the light of European guidelines on combating climate change."
"As a result, we have decided to give priority to investments of the type that will reduce CO2 emissions, and this already shows up in the figures for 2007, since finance for electricity generation products using fossil fuels accounts for only 25% of our financing in the energy sector."
"In 2007, the amount committed to renewable energies, for example, far exceeds the amount committed to these more traditional forms of energy generation."
"Finally, as regards the millennium development goals, we are obviously trying, as far as possible, to make sure our projects contribute to their achievement."
"However, I would draw your attention to the fact that when we intervene outside the European Union, we are acting on the basis of specific mandates given to us by the European Council."
"The millennium development goals do not feature as such in the mandates we have received from the European Council."
"That is why it is not possible to make as direct a link as you would have liked."
"Finally, to Mr Dillen who, if I understood correctly, mentioned a project he said we financed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I can say that for several years now we have not provided any more finance in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Our board of directors has in principle approved finance for a mining project in Katanga, but nothing has yet been paid out for this project."
"The loan agreement has not yet been signed."
"Why is this?"
"It is because the new Congolese Government quite rightly wanted to renegotiate the licence conditions to ensure more of the revenue went back to the Congolese state, and we suspended the signing of the contract until a satisfactory agreement had been reached between the promoter and the Congolese Government."
"Mr President, those are a few answers I can give to those who spoke, and I would like to thank Parliament once again, and particularly the Committee on Budgetary Control for our excellent collaboration."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, President Maystadt."
"We are very grateful to you for your presence here this morning, for your report and especially for the work you do for the European Union as President of the European Investment Bank. Thank you again and all the best!"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would in turn like to thank the Commissioner, Mr Almunia, and the President of the European Investment Bank, Mr Maystadt, for these specific answers."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteurs from the political groups, who supported the writing of this report."
"I would just like to share a few thoughts on the debate we have just had, firstly on the task of regulation."
"I believe it is in everyone's interest that banking regulation of this kind should be set up."
"Obviously I do not have the solution."
"The idea that it is the European Central Bank that should do it seems to me a good one."
"For the Luxembourg regulatory body to play a stronger independent role, a genuine regulatory role, could also be a short-term solution."
"Nevertheless, I believe Parliament will be very interested in the opinion of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors if the Bank applies to it as the report suggests."
"Finally, regarding the financing of infrastructure, I would like to say that the European Union is clearly at a cross-roads and that financing is not enough now, but that debt should obviously not be used to fund operation, which is sadly what is happening in some Member States."
"Debt used skilfully for investment is, however, a key part of economic and social performance in Europe, which is competing with all the other economic regions of the world."
"I believe the time has come for a major development policy for the land, partially supported by investment."
"There needs to be public investment, because if there is not, we cannot expect there to be private investment."
"It is a problem of collective confidence in the future of the European Union and I am delighted that the European Investment Bank can offer its expertise thanks to its experience and the quality of its human resources."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (DE) Mr President, President Maystadt, Mr Audy, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the rapporteur most warmly and congratulate him on the good, balanced work he has carried out."
"I congratulate the EIB on its successful activities and ambitious business plan."
"When it comes to energy and innovation, the EIB is helping the EU to implement its policy."
"Without the EIB we would not have got the CIP off to such a good start."
"The EIB's strategy for 2007-2009 provides for reinforcement of the value added, the gradual increase in risk taking, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Commission."
"I heartily endorse this strategy."
"The evaluation of the activity by the EIB rapporteur and the suggested next steps are correct."
"However, we must not forget that the role of Parliament is limited."
"Although the EIB is one of the Community's institutions, its power is exercised internally according to intergovernmental rules, which means that the Member States are the most influential shareholders."
"The European Parliament has been commenting on the EIB's activity reports regularly since 1999 and this has developed into a close, trusting, successful relationship of cooperation."
"I would particularly like to praise the cooperation with President Maystadt, which is exemplary for relationships with other institutions."
"2006 discharge (debate)"
"rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, I must begin by reminding everyone that we are nearing the end of an incredibly important exercise."
"In general terms, if Parliament's role is analysed in relation to that of the other institutions, it is perhaps possible to say that we have three main tasks."
"We are involved in creating legislation for the European countries and their citizens."
"We are involved in establishing the budget, i.e. determining what the EU's funds should be used for."
"Finally, the last role is to act as a supervisory body."
"It is Parliament that is the citizens' watchdog, if one can put it that way."
"The exercise that we will complete here today is possibly the most important part of this role of supervisory body: it is the part where we meticulously review the Commission and the other institutions in relation to how they manage the funds, and not least, of course, assess how things are working in the Member States, where we know that around 80% of the EU's funds are managed."
"That said, it is also naturally down to me to praise my fellow Members from the other groups."
"It is Parliament as a whole that will vote on the report today."
"I believe we have enjoyed excellent cooperation within the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I would particularly like to mention the shadow rapporteurs, who I believe have contributed very constructively to the matter."
"This is of course why we have been able to exert such enormous pressure on the Commission and enter into such constructive dialogue with it."
"Let me begin by mentioning a couple of positive points. I will certainly move on to the negative aspects, but let me begin by mentioning a couple of positive points in relation to previous years."
"There is no doubt that within the agricultural sector we have made good progress in connection with controlling the funds."
"The 'integrated financial control system' - and yes, this is probably not the view of many citizens out there in Europe who are following this speech - means of course that a completely new and much more effective way of controlling the EU's agricultural funds has been introduced."
"The system is extremely effective."
"The European Court of Auditors itself has highlighted this many times."
"We already know that within a few years essentially all the funds within the agricultural policy will be covered by this very effective system, which definitely deserves praise."
"However, in recent years we have had heard strong criticism regarding a number of points connected with the research policy."
"In addition, it must be noted at this point that the Commission has taken our criticism very seriously and has implemented an action plan, which has ensured that many of these problems are in the process of being resolved."
"The Commission deserves a great deal of praise for this."
"Finally, we are naturally very pleased about the initiatives, which have been brought out into the open."
"We now have openness concerning the recipients of EU support in relation to both social funds and agricultural expenses."
"Additionally, we will now find out the names of the participants of the various working groups in the Council and the Commission, something that this House has fought for for many years."
"The Commission has now consented to disclose this information."
"It has to be said that this is a very positive development."
"However, it is of course clear that this process has concerned areas in which we have had a certain amount of criticism."
"Everyone who has been following the process knows that this specifically concerns two areas: the Structural Funds and foreign policy matters, i.e. external matters."
"With regard to the Structural Funds, the Court of Auditors concluded very clearly that 12% of the funds that had been paid out should never have been paid: 12%, or almost EUR 4 billion."
"It is obvious that this is a completely unacceptable situation."
"It was the starting point for the exercise that we will conclude today."
"We have had several consultations, and together with the committee I have personally enjoyed close dialogue with the Commission."
"The fact that as rapporteur I can now finish by granting discharge is solely due to the fact that we have achieved a number of results."
"The Commission has actually implemented a considerable number of reforms - it has been shown that 37 very specific points will now be implemented."
"This has been adopted by the College of Commissioners."
"In some areas, it is a question of introducing both more and tighter controls, while in other areas it is a question of simplifying the controls to make them more effective."
"In all areas, very clear deadlines have been introduced."
"We have been given some very clear criteria regarding how feedback should be given, so that both we and the public have the opportunity to check that this also actually has a positive effect."
"We must remember two things: firstly, of course, the fact that the money that was paid out incorrectly in 2006 - which is the subject of this procedure - is to be recovered."
"We believe that this has now been guaranteed."
"However, there must also be a guarantee that it will not happen again in future."
"This is probably just as important."
"With the new procedures that the Commission has put forward, we believe that this goal has been achieved."
"It is obvious that fine words alone are not enough."
"Although we have now said that we accept the reforms that have been put forward, we will follow up this matter and monitor process very carefully."
"Therefore, today I would also like to put forward an amendment proposal, which I understand that the Commission is prepared to support."
"I have received an indication from Mr Kallas that it may be an acceptable solution if the Commission were to meet with the Committee on Budgetary Control once a month and give us the opportunity to discuss the progress made in this area."
"This would be incredibly beneficial for both parties."
"Allow me to say a few words about the second area in which we have experienced major problems."
"This concerns matters of foreign policy."
"More specifically, it concerns the issue of Iraq."
"We know that the EU is providing some funding for the reconstruction of Iraq - there are certainly many good political reasons for doing so."
"We have singled out Iraq as an example."
"We would like a list of the specific projects in Iraq that are financed either in part or in full by the EU via the UN and the World Bank."
"Obtaining such a list has proved to be extremely difficult."
"It has taken several months."
"The information that we already knew should have been on the list was nevertheless not on the list, and there was a prolonged discussion back and forth until, quite recently, we finally obtained the information that we should have had in the first place."
"This is of course why we are now finally in a position where we can actually also give discharge in this area."
"The most important question in connection with this is naturally: what about the future?"
"Iraq is simply one example."
"What about the other countries, of which there are more than 100, where the EU provides support for various activities?"
"The Commission has now committed itself to granting public access to the final beneficiary, i.e. the final recipient of the support, from 2007 onwards, which is something that I acknowledge and believe is entirely necessary."
"For all these reasons, I recommend that we grant discharge."
"There are a number of criticisms that can be highlighted with regard to the Commission and with regard to the ways that things are done in the Member States."
"I would also like to say that we have achieved a result through good dialogue with the Commission."
"This means that we can now recommend that approval be granted for the accounts for 2006."
"There are still areas in which we would like to see things being taken further."
"We would very much like to have 'national declarations of assurance', as is the term here in Parliament, i.e. annual national auditing declarations, signed by the finance minister of the country in question."
"We still believe that this would be a very beneficial tool in the fight against deception, fraud and secrecy concerning EU funds in the individual countries."
"With this concluding wish, I would like to say thank you for the opportunity to speak in the first round."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, welcome to this debate, attended by the Secretary-General and of course welcome to Mr Kallas."
"I cannot welcome anyone from the Council, as it appears that it does not have anything to do with accounts and taking responsibility for the political debate on discharge."
"I hope that when the Council has a president, after the Treaty of Lisbon, we will be guaranteed that the Council will also be present at this debate."
"I would first like to congratulate my colleague Dan Jørgensen on his excellent report, and highlight from what he said how well things are being done in the European Union, and how they are being done better every year."
"He referred on several occasions to an initiative by Commissioner Kallas and the Commission on transparency."
"I was rapporteur two months ago for an own-initiative report supporting the transparency policy."
"Well, the Commission is indeed making progress on transparency policy, as Parliament has also done."
"I would like to point out that the role of Parliament in giving discharge is a political role, and that we are not and nor should we be accountants."
"It is a political role, and the question that we have to answer for citizens is: with the money that Parliament has, have we been able to meet the budgetary challenges for the 2006 financial year?"
"Challenges such as Parliament preparing for enlargement, to receive new Member States, expanding the information policy, doing our work better, preparing ourselves for the challenge of Lisbon, in that we are going to have to legislate more and in the best possible way."
"What is the political verdict on what we have done with these financial commitments?"
"It is a positive one."
"We have done well."
"I would like to highlight a few points from this financial year."
"Firstly, on the initiative of President Hans Pöttering, we have initiated a political dialogue between the Presidency and the procedure for discharge, which until now did not appear to be possible."
"Now it is possible, and your vice-president was present at the debate, facing up to the questions put to him live and direct by the committee."
"Also, on the initiative of the President, the Bureau is going to have a regular procedure of working with the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, so I thank you."
"Many aspects of transparency in Parliament have improved, as you can see in the report."
"We have improved the presentation of the roles of our assistants."
"What has not been possible this year has been for us to finally create a statute for assistants, which we are asking for."
"The truth is that as MEPs it has taken us a long time to have our own statute."
"In short, we will have to ask for patience, but we must emphasise that we have not yet achieved this objective."
"In 2006, however, the reference year, 99% of papers were submitted in the right way, so I think that this issue is also moving in the right direction."
"We have outstanding problems, and on these we are more or less trying to do what we can."
"Citizens do not understand why Parliament should have three locations, they do not understand it, and they are not going to understand it because it is not easy to understand."
"This is another challenge for when the Council has a president: finding a solution."
"Parliament has, however, done its duty and reduced the cost of the three locations from EUR 203 million in 2002 to EUR 155 million."
"We have cut the bill by 24%, which is good."
"What challenges are we going to tackle, as I mention in this report?"
"As I have just said, giving our assistants a definitive statute, as we have ourselves."
"There is also the challenge of legislating better."
"Parliament is going to play a much greater qualitative role and have a much larger workload with the Lisbon Treaty when it comes."
"Let us hope that the Belgian Government, now that we have a Belgian Government, will treat us a little better in terms of buildings policy than it has up to now, as its treatment has been mediocre."
"I would like to finish by saying that we have had a prudent year in terms of our budgetary responsibilities, and this is why I am asking you to vote in favour of these accounts for 2006."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I have been the rapporteur for these other institutions as they have been called, seven of them, in other words the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Ombudsman."
"I have had no serious objections to anything I have looked at."
"It has been a matter of normal comments on what can and should be improved."
"There have been no revelations which could in any way call into question granting of discharge to any of these seven institutions."
"Nevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that granting discharge, exacting responsibility, is fundamental to democracy."
"I have no faith in this chamber's way of handling this task, as I had precisely the same job of examining these seven institutions two years ago and then, ladies and gentlemen, discovered the most appalling things going on in the Committee of the Regions."
"I found that fraud of the most serious nature had been committed there."
"I obtained material which you were all able to read in the secret reading room."
"There were three separate investigations into this: one by OLAF, our Anti-Fraud Office, one by the Court of Auditors, and the Committee of the Regions itself also conducted an internal investigation."
"They had dismissed their internal auditors."
"The list of complaints was endless."
"I therefore naturally proposed that we should not grant discharge in those circumstances."
"I said this in the committee."
"The committee still voted to discharge."
"I said the same thing here in Parliament two years ago, and you voted to discharge by a large majority."
"This shows that when you should be voting to discharge here today on my recommendation, you are not doing so because I say so but purely out of habit."
"This assembly is not accepting its responsibility."
"It is thinking more of the EU's reputation."
"You are thinking more about deceiving the citizens, the voters."
"They must not be allowed to know what is going on."
"Therefore, it is with considerable sadness that I say 'yes, this time these other institutions can be granted discharge'."
"I can do so with a clear conscience."
"Most of you cannot."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, you despot!"
"My speech today is directed to all those ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"That is the second time that you have spoken like this."
"I reserve the right to take action against you."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Mr President, I shall begin by discussing discharge regarding the European Development Fund."
"Many of you here were perhaps expecting another tall, Nordic young man to be doing this job, namely our colleague Alexander Stubb, but, as some of you will know, Alexander is unable to be here with us today as he has been appointed Finland's new Minister of Foreign Affairs."
"He therefore asked me to take over and present his work and his report here today."
"I believe that I am speaking for the majority here when I say that we are sad to lose Alexander, but that it is great news for Alexander and especially great news for Finland."
"However, I would like to start by congratulating him on the work he has done here on the European Development Fund."
"Work in committee went very well, and it is a united committee which is discussing discharging the development funds today."
"The European Development Funds are, of course, one of the means of promoting democracy and economic development in the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) States."
"It is for this reason that I think it is gratifying to be able to see that the money is being used in a correct and responsible manner."
"In 2006 they had considerable resources, EUR 3 billion in commitments, and managed to pay out just under 90% of this."
"However, the fact that here today we are pleased to be able to grant, and propose the granting of discharge to the Commission which has managed these development funds - and this is something we really are pleased about - does not mean that there are no challenges or that there are no areas which we need to work on in the future."
"I would just like to bring up a few of these."
"For example, unlike last year, we can state that the Court of Auditors did not present an entirely clean statement of assurance, but pointed out a number of problems, for example regarding evidence of transactions which could have been better documented and regarding payments from different delegations."
"However, I would like to give the Commission credit for having taken these problems seriously and presented concrete, correct and important solutions to these challenges."
"Furthermore, in our report we also highlight the problems incurred by the delay in implementing the modern IT system."
"This is a matter which we take seriously, and we hope that the Commission is working on it further."
"Enough of the more administrative and economic aspects, as there are also a number of politically important issues which I would like to raise."
"Firstly, the fact that the work of the European Development Fund could be made considerably easier if it were incorporated in the ordinary budget."
"Similarly, we believe that if we had one financial regulation which controlled all current and future development funds, that would also make work easier."
"That is enough about the European Development Fund."
"I would like to take this opportunity to briefly mention something about discharge of the independent agencies."
"I bring this up partly because I have been responsible for this work in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, but possibly mainly because the rapporteur, as we heard just now, has an unusual attitude, to say the least, and has not exactly taken the line the committee chose to follow."
"I think it is very strange that Hans-Peter Martin has not chosen to remove his name from all these reports, considering that it is not his opinion which we will be voting on in plenary here today."
"If, nevertheless, I am to say something about the work itself, about some of the important opinions that, despite everything, we have in these reports - and which we have obtained thanks to successful and close cooperation between the Socialist Group, our group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - I would just like to highlight the fact that we grant discharge because we think that there are grounds in the Court of Auditors' statement for approving the management of the finances of these independent agencies."
"However, alongside that, there are also problems there, which we hope will be worked on further."
"This particularly involves all the institutions - the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament - being better at examining the agencies' requests."
"I hope that everyone will take responsibility for this."
"I will return next year, when I will be the rapporteur on this issue and hope to be able to discuss it with the Commission in greater depth."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, fellow Members, I would like to thank Dan Jørgensen and Alexander Stubb, as they matched the intentions of the Committee on Development one to one."
"We are very thankful for this because we in the Committee on Development worked very hard on this question."
"The European Union - the budgets of the European Union itself, combined with the budgets of the Member States - is by far the largest donor of development aid in the world."
"Nevertheless, with what is happening currently, we find that it is still far too little, and that we really ought to do more."
"We cannot wait until food and energy shortages in the world blow up in our face and then be surprised that people take to the streets."
"The money that we donate - and, as I said, we are already the world's largest donor - needs to be targeted more precisely so that we know that the money actually reaches those who need it and that it is not dissipated and does not disappear."
"Therefore, we have devoted a great deal of energy to checking whether the funds that we deploy are in fact used for the intended purpose."
"A key emphasis for Parliament and the Committee is that 20% of the funds have to be used for basic health care and basic and further education, so as to establish a foundation for the future."
"Thus we have made some progress, but the Commission is still a long way from where we would like it to be."
"You need to do more work on it; we will keep at you."
"We called on you to reduce backlogs of payments from the past and indeed, arrears from before 2001 have been reduced by 39% for Europe Aid and by 49% for the European Development Fund."
"These are good figures, but of course they can only ever be an interim stage."
"In relation to development policy, we have repeatedly pointed out that it makes no sense at all to maintain two complete systems running in parallel - one for the European Development Fund and one for development aid."
"It must be integrated in the budget!"
"This is a demand that we are making now and that we will make in future negotiations on financial forecasts."
"My last point concerns budget assistance."
"Increasingly, the Commission is granting countries general budget assistance."
"It is possible to do this, but be careful that you do not experience what we experienced with the current Member States in relation to the Structural Funds - that we transfer responsibility because the states are supposed to take responsibility, and then find out that the systems are not functioning and that 'nobody' was responsible for this."
"Hence my advice: please be certain about what you are doing from the very start."
"We will be with you all the way, critical but also positive."
"Overall, sincere congratulations to the rapporteurs and thank you very much for the cooperation."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and with regard to budget management, I would like to begin by expressing our concern at the fact that outstanding budgetary commitments have continued to rise and that this, combined with the replacement of the n+2 rule by n+3, a change which some Member States are due to implement for the period 2007 to 2013, might worsen the situation, with the result that funds may take longer to reach their ultimate recipients."
"What we are dealing with here are policies that directly affect citizens, such as the European Social Fund, and the delays could have disastrous effects in terms of the efficient and successful use of the funds."
"As regards structural policies, we agree with the Court of Auditors on the need to improve control systems so as to forestall errors in projects carried out in the area of Structural Funds."
"More supervision, more efficient audits and effective monitoring of projects from beginning to end are needed to enable any shortcomings or errors to be remedied in good time."
"For this reason, the European Commission should have the logistical capacity and adequate resources to make feedback mechanisms genuinely operational and to keep auditing procedures properly under review."
"However, it is essential to use meaningful indicators and targets which should lend themselves to comparison and, as far as possible, aggregation in the short term, so that the analysis of structural policy trends can be carried out in such a way as to avoid what would inevitably be rough and hazy assessments that would not therefore be very conclusive concerning the effective application of those funds."
"I consider it important to mention the timeliness of the Commission's recommendation to Member States that they should make use of the simplifications provided for in the new Structural Funds regulations, for instance by using flat-rate amounts for indirect costs under the European Social Fund."
"I should also like to congratulate the European Commission on the investment in the EURES network and to applaud the virtues of holding the European Year of Workers' Mobility."
"They naturally highlighted the mobility-related issues we all recognise and still face."
"As for the European agencies that are being analysed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would just like to thank them briefly for the work they have done and, as we have all seen, we can on the whole give a very positive assessment of their activities."
"Nevertheless, I would like to conclude by drawing attention to the need to increase the appropriation for the Dublin Agency, which is now entrusted with analysing anticipated changes in employment and the business world, the aim being to bolster the socio-economic project through the assessment of applications under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"We all know how important this could be."
"It is therefore an area of the utmost sensitivity and importance, which should merit special attention from the European Union, namely by means of this analysis conducted by the Dublin Agency, which may in some way help to anticipate the potential crises that we can all envisage on the horizon in any one of the 27 Member States."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on the Environment was pleased with the work done by the Directorate-General for the Environment and the Directorate-General for Health."
"I know that is something you do not hear from me very often."
"Usually I criticise the Commission, but in this case 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'."
"Those responsible for budgets in both Directorates-General are very cooperative. Thank you very much."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Dan Jørgensen."
"He worked hard throughout the entire budget discharge procedure, has presented an excellent report and generously took on board all the conclusions of the Committee on the Environment on granting discharge for 2006."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has thereby acknowledged what the Committee on the Environment adopted unanimously. Thank you very much for that, too."
"May I now to say a few words about our agencies."
"We in the Committee on the Environment were also pleased with the work and budget management of the four agencies: the European Environment Agency, the European Food Safety Authority, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the European Medicines Agency."
"When we advised the Committee on Budgetary Control to grant discharge for the 2006 financial year, it was not done lightly."
"Quite to the contrary!"
"There was frequent exchange of information with members of the management board and with the directors in the committee."
"In addition, several delegations from our committee visited the agencies to satisfy themselves as to the activities on the ground."
"Therefore it was all the more incomprehensible to us all when the rapporteur in the Committee on Budgetary Control did not want to grant discharge for three of the four agencies, for the most incredible reasons - particularly as, even if they were valid, the agencies themselves were not responsible for those points, for example staff regulations relating to temporary staff of the institution, or the location of the head office of the relevant agency, or even the way the principle of subsidiarity was observed."
"Phrases like: 'There has been irresponsible proliferation,' 'new agencies have been set up on the basis of bizarre political decisions, these new agencies are not subject to control and are often uncontrollable, mostly inefficient and, above all, they give rise to significant burdens on European taxpayers,' and 'at the same time, an unprecedented range of staff privileges has become established' - have nothing but shock value."
"We are all well aware that there is a deliberate scheme afoot to whip up a scandal about work at European level."
"I utterly abhor this scandal-mongering."
"Agencies are European administrative units, although they have a unique nature."
"They do not just drop out of the sky; they do not just occur spontaneously to the Commission alone; they are established by a proper regulatory procedure, either by codecision or in consultation or, depending on the policy field, by regulation, i.e. by legislation."
"This means that these agencies are brought into being by the European legislator, which means that we are the 'adventurers' being referred to."
"The budget for the agencies is part of the budget of the European Union itself."
"Each financial year, we discharge the director."
"I believe there is no section of the administration that is controlled as well as the agencies and I am therefore delighted and thankful that the committee has put a stop to this attempt to create a scandal."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take a few moments to underline the fact that for the implementation of the budget of the European Agencies for the financial year 2006, we can support what the Court of Auditors says, since the accounts and transactions are legitimate and regular."
"As I said in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, however, I recommend greater compliance with the principles and rules in subsequent years."
"In the case of the Maritime Safety Agency, 43% of payment appropriations were cancelled and a concentration of transactions was recorded towards the end of the financial year."
"I also expressed puzzlement about the low utilisation rate for payment appropriations for anti-polluting measures at sea, despite Parliament's continuing support for these measures."
"For the Aviation Safety Agency, the high rate of appropriations carried over, at 40% of operational expenditure, was also noted, as was the use of carry-overs of non-differentiated appropriations, which is a breach of the budgetary principle of annuality."
"The Commission is therefore called upon to review the Agency's fee structure to bring costs and revenue for certification activities into balance."
"Finally, for the Railway Agency, the use of expired contracts and irregular extensions to regular existing contracts means that it cannot be stated that all transactions were legal."
"I therefore recommend greater transparency and accuracy in future; however, in the light of the Court of Auditors' observations I propose that Parliament grant the discharge to the executive directors of the agencies."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, I would like to state that our goal is to promote cultural diversity in Europe."
"Our culture programme reaches citizens where they live, which is our stated goal."
"Accordingly, we expect extremely good management from our national cultural agencies, and I would like to add that the revision of financial regulation will improve our ability to target finance and support for small projects that citizens apply for in their own areas."
"However, this also means that we have to find the right balance between cutting bureaucracy and preventing fraud which, in turn, means that we need rules that are appropriate."
"If citizens who need small sums in order to be able to carry out their cultural projects are not to have to fill out endless application documents, we need to simplify procedures and move to flat-rate financing."
"That way, we will find greater acceptance amongst the citizens of Europe for our culture programmes."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs decided to give an opinion in favour of giving discharge to the Commission in this field and to the five agencies that it is responsible for."
"With regard to the Commission's management, we welcome the substantial increase in the execution of payments and we hope that this trend will continue in 2007, although we know that this year is going to be the start of a new programming period and our experience shows us that it is more difficult to fulfil this goal and that there is a degree of delay."
"The Committee on Civil Liberties welcomes the fact that the Court of Auditors - and I quote - 'has been able to obtain reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2006 are reliable' for the five agencies that are fall within the competence of the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"Having said this, I would like to make some observations on some points that are still not very clear regarding the implementation of budgets."
"Firstly, the agency Frontex, which had a low rate of implementation of the allocated funds, but this should not cause us to be pessimistic."
"We need to take into account that 2006 was the first year that it was actually in operation and that in the following year it showed that it could spend its whole budget."
"The visit by the Committee on Civil Liberties to Warsaw, to the headquarters of Frontex, was very positive."
"We therefore hope that in future financial years it will be able to be granted discharge with no reservations, despite the fact that the lack of political vision on the part of the Council and the Commission has made the budgetary life of this agency quite hazardous."
"Although perhaps this debate is not the most appropriate forum, I would like to take advantage of it to point out that the proper operation of Frontex depends, to a large extent, on the cooperation of the Member States, given the hybrid nature of the agency."
"If the Member States do not make the appropriate resources available, Frontex will not be able to meet its commitments."
"Regarding the Eurojust agency, I would simply like to say that there is just one negative note, regarding its high number of transfers between headings, which should be better justified."
"We have also criticised some problems with hiring staff at the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, and we regret that the Court of Auditors considers that the situation pointed out in 2005 has still not been resolved regarding a member of staff at the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction who was sent to Brussels on a long-term mission without any clearly defined goal."
"Finally I want to mention the case of CEPOL, the European Police College."
"There we do have some doubts."
"Mr Kallas, we have asked the European Commission to closely monitor the implementation of its budget, as there are considerable suspicions that it is not fully and strictly complying with European legislation on public procurement."
"Mr President, with respect to this year's budget discharge procedure, we should be pleased with the progress made by the Commission towards more efficient utilisation of EU funds, especially in the area of the common agricultural policy."
"Also worthy of support is the initiative taken by some Member States to draft and publish national statements that constitute a new element in the process managing Community funds, and the remaining States should also see to this formality as soon as possible."
"The Commission's undertaking to get to the bottom of all cases of violation of the procedures for placing public orders mentioned in the annual report of the Court of Auditors, and to introduce a policy of suspension of payments following the detection of serious transgressions in the system, is also significant."
"As an expert in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I would like to emphasise the continuing lack of budget planning with regard to the gender issue and am once again calling for this aspect to be taken into account as part of budget planning and the funding of Community programmes."
"Information on actions favouring gender equality that have received support from the social fund should be reflected in reports on budget implementation in the years to come."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin with the discharge by Parliament and by thanking our rapporteur and all Members who wanted to achieve progress on the secretarial assistance allowance, because this point is crucial, in the public's opinion, and should also form the focus of our observations."
"It is in the interest of all of us as MEPs to find a way out of this dirty corner of corruption."
"The European People's Party has suggested ways by which the secretarial assistance allowance could be managed more efficiently in future."
"These proposals were approved by a large majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control, including that the paying agents in the Member States should be notified by Parliament itself and thereby become more professional."
"These paying agents would then also administer the contracts for services and ensure that taxes are paid and social security contributions are deducted."
"These amendments protect Parliament's reputation, as does the point that MEPs should no longer be able to employ family members in future."
"Under the rules of the EU, this means a very significant conflict of interests."
"Therefore, I call upon all Members to avoid further damage to ourselves and to Parliament."
"I note with concern that the Socialist Group, along with some of the Liberals, wants to vote against this passage of text."
"If they prevail, it will mean that we complete the discharge process without making any progress in this very important aspect, and that would be the absolute worst case scenario for us all, because a cheery 'carry on' will not get us through the latest report by the Court of Auditors on the secretarial assistance allowance."
"Also with regard to the Parliamentary assistants' allowance, which we agreed on together, we want to keep to the view that it is no cure-all."
"I want to recommend that you all read the fine print."
"It is all still up in the air, which means that saying at this point that the Parliamentary assistants' allowance will help us solve every problem is simply a lie - and also a lie to the public."
"I would like to say one last thing about the Commission budget."
"Commissioner, it was certainly close, and I hope that your colleagues have bought you a drink, because you have earned it."
"Thank you very much for the good cooperation!"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Vice-President of the Commission, I too would like to thank all the rapporteurs and also all my socialist colleagues, and those from other groups as well, who took part in this discharge process and who did so much to ensure it was concluded."
"In fact, it is precisely this European Parliament issue that I would like to comment on."
"I would like to say that it seems clear to me that the fundamental conclusion we can draw from the internal audit report is that there are serious shortcomings in the way the parliamentary assistance payments system works."
"There is no shadow of a doubt that these require the introduction of an Assistants' Statute and the financial management tasks for payments being handed over to the European Parliament's administration."
"In the next parliamentary term, it is imperative that not only MEPs have a statute, but also that their assistants' work is regulated and financed through the European institutional framework, leaving no justification for the continued existence of a publicly-funded voluntary pension scheme and making the rules on travel expenses and other general expenses clearer."
"The Council needs to vote in favour of this matter and prevent the institution of the European Parliament being held to ransom by trifling perks of position."
"In the same way it is vital that Members are guaranteed the best working conditions, while still bearing in mind the need to be governed by rules of total transparency and rigour fully in line with the general rules applicable to society."
"I would especially like to call on our colleagues in the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats not to block this reform process."
"It is absolutely crucial that we reach a consensus in this Parliament on an Assistants' Statute and that this statute is clear and governs an issue that has unnecessarily contributed to our institution losing credibility."
"It is paramount we achieve this and we will need everyone's support to do so."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs who have contributed to this discharge procedure."
"I would like to use the two minutes available to me to discuss the Commission's discharge report drawn up by Mr Jørgensen."
"The Court of Auditors published its report last November and that report was considerably better than in previous years, owing to the fact that this time, the report cited percentages."
"This should be continued in future reports."
"When the report was published, it was almost as if the Commission had triumphed."
"The report had never been so good."
"The Court of Auditors approved 44% of the Commission's expenditure."
"I must say that I did not feel this was the time to sit back contently and say: 'This is the best we have ever done'."
"No, we can do much better."
"What is striking is that the Commission actually disregarded Parliament's recommendations in previous discharge resolutions."
"What has been significant for Parliament over the past three years?"
"The national declarations."
"What does the Commission say?"
"We will not respect the national declarations."
"This is too much."
"Furthermore, this is included in the financial perspective, in an interinstitutional agreement."
"Fortunately, the Commission has retraced its footsteps and this will now take place."
"There is a second issue, however."
"The Commissioners cannot countersign the declarations of the Directors-General."
"It puzzles me why that is so."
"We can receive the Commissioners in the Committee on Budgetary Control, as offered by the Commission, and regularly hear their views with regard to how much progress has been made, yet the Commissioners are not permitted to sign anything with Parliament."
"How can this be explained from a legal perspective?"
"I can only say, Mr President, that we hope that next year will be even better."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will adopt a constructive attitude in all of this, as it has in the past."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (DA) Mr President, for the ninth time, I have had the opportunity to participate in the process whereby Parliament approves the accounts for the Commission, the Council, Parliament and the other EU bodies."
"Once again, this year we have found major irregularities."
"The situation was particularly bad in connection with the Commission's management of the money in the Structural Funds, where nearly EUR 4 billion (almost DKK 30 million) was paid out incorrectly."
"For reasons of time, I will focus my remarks on this."
"Once again this year we are saying that there is something wrong, and once again we are receiving assurances that things will indeed be improved."
"We have received such assurances every year and yet the situation continues because the entire support system is so complicated, so unreasonable and so impossible to manage."
"In the Committee on Budgetary Control we have raised the pivotal question: for the EU as a whole, what is the effect of the enormous reallocation of money between the Member States?"
"After all, there are no visible improvements in the countries that receive support."
"Next year they will again be behind and they will receive support once again."
"Of the 15 old EU Member States, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Ireland have received support every single year since they became members."
"There are 11 Member States, all old Member States, paying for the entire net difference."
"Naturally, all new members receive support."
"Countries that implement economic reforms and work effectively, and where the citizens are willing to pay high taxes, must pay countries that will not reform their obsolete structures or demand particularly high taxes."
"The EU's support policy is to a large extent doing nothing!"
"Why carry out reforms when it is possible to send the bill for not doing so to the citizens of other countries?"
"The entire reallocation is foolish."
"Not only do many billions end up in the wrong hands, but the support philosophy itself is sick because it rewards countries that will not implement reforms and punishes those that are doing just that, countries that the EU needs."
"The EU could perform its tasks with 15% of the current budget!"
"In addition, we would also be free of all such cases of economic scandal."
"Therefore, I personally intend to vote against approval of the Commission's accounts."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Budgetary Control for the considerable amount of good work that they have done."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I will limit my contribution to the Commission's discharge and that of Parliament."
"With regard to the Commission's discharge, we are faced with problems that have been sufficiently explained, particularly by the rapporteurs: the fact that the Court of Auditors reported a great many problems in relation to the structural funds, that in fact 12% should not have been paid out (EUR 4 billion, which is an enormous amount) and, with regard to external relations, the fact that, among other things, cooperation with the United Nations is going poorly and awkwardly."
"These are the problems that we have discussed."
"This was a significant discharge, because it is the last discharge before the elections."
"We have another discharge next year, but this will be held during a pre-election phase."
"It was therefore a significant discharge and we have had to exact dialogue."
"I am delighted that we did this in a highly constructive manner, across the groups."
"The fact that we have twice organised a hearing with Commissioners Špidla and Hübner and the fact that we - Mr Jørgensen, Mr Mulder, Mrs Gräßle and I - have been able to exact information from the Commission by means of a joint letter, has led to an excellent result."
"I sincerely hope that we can achieve a better result next year."
"With regard to Parliament, I would like to concentrate on two major problems."
"In relation to the assistants' statute, we have the internal audit, conducted by the internal auditor."
"I must commend him on this; it is an excellent document."
"I still do not understand, Mr President, why you and the Bureau have not published this audit."
"After all, this is currently surrounded by secrecy and this is not necessary, because we, as Parliament, have always requested that this audit be carried out and that an inquiry be conducted into how the secretariat allowances are managed."
"I now firmly believe that we must implement that statute."
"I have submitted a number of other amendments to reinforce Mr Pomés Ruiz's existing text."
"This must take place in dialogue with the Commission, but also in dialogue with the Council in particular, because if, in the near future, we approach the Council with a problem that it fails to follow up on, then we are not where we need to be."
"This must therefore be done in dialogue with the Commission and with the Council."
"One final item that I would like to mention is that the voluntary pension fund causes me a great deal of concern."
"Firstly, the actuarial shortfall is continuing to increase, and secondly, I would also like the list of participants in that voluntary pension fund to finally be published."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the whole Parliament and all my colleagues are pleased about the progress made in using European appropriations more effectively."
"We cannot avoid pointing out, however, that there are still some major deficiencies."
"The Commission should launch infringement proceedings and penalties against Member States that do not apply, or only partially apply, the regulations on the Structural Funds."
"The Member States should provide all information about corrections and financial recoveries, especially for forthcoming financial management."
"The Commission should present Parliament with an evaluation of the quality of annual reports received from individual countries, especially broken down by area of intervention and by different policies."
"The most important area is that of the Structural Funds, where there is still a significant volume of improper repayments, at 12%."
"The Commission must explain how it will ensure this money will be recovered, especially in cases where projects have not been accepted through the use of tendering procedures."
"Faster and more effective suspension procedures should be used against Member States that do not carry out adequate checks."
"The thing I want to emphasise, which seems to me the greatest deficiency of this budget, is external actions: there is not enough information on these, though they benefit from a number of European activities."
"In particular the Commission should provide greater visibility over projects financed by the European Union for reconstruction in Iraq in 2006; for example, it should list the projects, what they are, the anticipated costs, and the agencies involved."
"This information has been supplied, rather late, but I still do not think it is satisfactory."
"Specifically, I think that for this type of use of funds, we should look at the idea of using the European Agency for Reconstruction, as Parliament has highlighted in the past."
"I will quickly come to Parliament's discharge."
"First of all, there is the issue of the three sites, raised by the rapporteur, for which the environmental cost should also be added to the financial cost."
"Finally, the internal report on the management of expenditure for assistants: I believe it was wrong to keep it confidential, because this has led to a whole series of articles in the press that are damaging transparency and the proper functioning of Parliament."
"For this reason, we ask for this internal audit to be published."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, in the limited time I am allowed to comment on this lengthy report, I would like to make two observations."
"First, it contains a great many empty platitudes about the supporting paperwork MEPs should provide to support claims from their parliamentary assistants' allowance."
"In the light of recent events it is painfully clear that the arrangements currently in place are wholly inadequate, as they are subject to gross serial abuse by many Members."
"Furthermore, it is equally clear that there is no serious intention to do anything about these abuses, as I understand the system will not change before the new Parliament convenes in autumn 2009."
"Therefore I cannot take the report's censorious tones at all seriously."
"Secondly, I draw Members' attention to the rather sinister clause 55 of the report, which reveals that, as from 2008, European political parties may be financed up to 85% from the European Parliament budget."
"It then goes on to point out that this high level of subsidy entails an additional degree of responsibility with regard to their activities."
"In other words, the EU finances political parties and also controls their activities."
"This is Big Brother writ large and provides even more evidence of the disastrous decline of democracy in Europe generated by this increasingly totalitarian European Union."
"As a democrat I abhor it, and to those who support it: shame on you."
"Mr President, it is only right to inform the House and the European Investment Bank, whose accounts are under review this morning, that their 200 million euros' worth of soft loans to the British Broadcasting Corporation - commonly nowadays known as the Brussels Broadcasting Corporation - are now the subject of a criminal investigation by the British police."
"The BBC faces a prima facie charge of breaching its Royal Charter, specifically in its failure to provide balanced and objective reporting of current affairs."
"The EIB's claims that the BBC's editorial policy has not been influenced by these loans is simply beyond belief."
"As a result of many years' research, not least by Lord Pearson - at his considerable expense - it has become obvious that the BBC has, in effect, been bought by the EIB on behalf of the EU."
"As a result of that, BBC senior management now seem to regard themselves as above the law."
"We shall see shortly whether Scotland Yard police agree."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like first to thank everyone who worked to prepare this important discharge for 2006 and supported our rapporteur."
"It is perhaps the most important discharge that we have undertaken during this term."
"We see the problems, and we still have time to resolve those problems."
"I would like at this point to convey our particular thanks to the European Court of Auditors, the authority of whose reports grows from year to year."
"It would just be good if, from time to time, the Court of Auditors could withstand the temptation to populism."
"We remember the stud farm associations and the golf clubs, and all that goes with them. Those were more political assessments than the assessments of a court of auditors."
"I would like to thank the European Commission which, in the end, negotiated a tight follow-up with us, also under pressure from a tough-talking rapporteur from this committee."
"Commissioner Kallas has already mentioned how we want to proceed in the coming months."
"National declarations by the Member States are important."
"Council is not here today - we can see that - they are not paying attention to how their taxpayers' taxes are being used, so we have to do it."
"We will make progress in structural policies."
"Commissioner Kallas, we will continue to have difficulties in external policy."
"We pointed out the first time that this external policy was not sufficiently monitored, even though we are spending billions on it."
"In the world of international finance, it is usual for voting rights to be allocated according to the obligations to make contributions."
"If the European Union contributes more than 40% to rebuilding Iraq, for example, I would have liked us to have more than 40% of the participation rights and codecision rights."
"There is still a long way to go, so there is much to be done here."
"Today we will be voting on good reports and it is now a matter of giving them good support."
"(FI) Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteurs and the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control for doing an excellent job."
"Now before us are 30 reports on discharge pertaining to the year 2006."
"The most important of them is the Commission's, which relates to 97% of the EU's budget."
"The rest relate to the EU's other institutions and separate agencies."
"In my opinion, the way the matter of discharge is dealt with by Parliament should be improved."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control cannot be a Court of Auditors and still less a firm of accountants."
"It is a physical impossibility for it to conduct a detailed examination of the administration and accounts of 30 units."
"Parliament has to put its trust in experts and the opinions of official bodies."
"Of these, the European Court of Auditors, internal monitoring bodies, and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are the most important."
"Even the most stringent detailed examination of accounts and administration only results in what is an apparent degree of accuracy, and that does not make the outcome any more reliable."
"There is no direct correlation between the way discharge is dealt with and the number of reports produced."
"On the contrary, when Parliament grants discharge to a single agency, for example, that might be too strong an assurance that the accounts and administration were meticulously attended to."
"If Parliament really wants to strengthen its role in the discharge process it should revise its practices."
"Otherwise, the Committee on Budgetary Control will be inundated with work."
"(PL) Mr President, in Mr Jørgensen's report consideration has quite rightly been given - following the opinion of the Court of Auditors - to the problems of funding the common agricultural policy, and specifically to the fact that some of its beneficiaries have nothing to do with agriculture."
"Golf clubs, cricket clubs, horse riding clubs, leisure parks - may they prosper, but not on common agricultural policy funds."
"This afternoon in this House we shall be debating the food crisis and the rise in food prices, and surely one of the reasons for this crisis is that EU funds that should be used to to support agriculture are being used to support completely different businesses that can manage perfectly well without this help."
"This is why I am fully behind the conclusions contained in Articles 99 and 100 of Mr Jørgensen's report, which point to the need for changes in the funding of the common agricultural policy to ensure that aid is chanelled only to real farmers - those who use the land for agricultural purposes - and these changes must be introduced as soon as possible."
"(NL) I would like to quote the most learned man of our time, Mr Einstein."
"He said: 'The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing'."
"That is the case here in Parliament as well."
"We have known for decades that a great deal of tampering has been taking place with regard to assistants' allowances, travel allowances, allowances for general expenditure, daily allowances, funds for visiting groups and funds for political groups."
"I hope that Parliament is finally going to do something about this before the 2009 elections, and that these will not be just empty promises as has been the case over the past few decades."
"In anticipation of this, I actually believe that we should postpone the discharge."
"I feel it will be unmarketable to the voters if we grant ourselves discharge."
"(FI) Mr President, an excellent job has been done under the leadership of Siim Kallas, Vice-President of the European Commission, to make the European Union's accounts more open and transparent."
"The call to publicise EU single payments deserves special recognition."
"In my country, Finland, national subsidies are nevertheless twice the value of EU aid."
"Unfortunately, the data on the recipients of EU aid do not tell the whole truth about single payments."
"Under pressure from the Committee on Budgetary Control, the Commission has improved the way in which the accounts are inspected and has promised to put more effort into clawing back payments made for the wrong reasons."
"Similarly, there is better quality information now available on financing under external actions, thanks to the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs."
"I hope there will also be a strict approach in the future to monitoring pan-European political parties and compliance with the rules on them, as opposed to what we can sometimes conclude from Parliament's behaviour."
"(DA) Mr President, we have come a long way in terms of openness and the battle against fraud within the EU."
"When I was first elected in 1979, the group chairmen led the way in taking from the till."
"First a chauffer-driven limousine paid for by Parliament, and then a dip into the Members' funds to get business-class travel for the same journey plus a little extra!"
"Nowadays, the chairmen are leading the way in the clean-up operation. However, there is a long way to go and we have been dealt a severe knock-back with the majority decision to not make the internal audit report public."
"How can we be the guardians of others when we dare not address our own problems?"
"The large groups carry a heavy burden of responsibility, as the voting percentage for Parliament next time may fall below 40%, seriously weakening the legitimacy of the election."
"I had hoped that one day I would be able to vote in favour of a set of annual accounts because there was no longer anything to criticise. However, the large groups are again recommending that we rubber-stamp the Commission's accounts even though we still do not have complete access to them in order to check them."
"What would an auditor say to a set of accounts if he did not have access to all the annexes?"
"For 14 years in a row, the Court of Auditors have declared that they cannot verify the correctness of the underlying transactions, and therefore unfortunately for the 29th year in a row I must again vote against approval."
"However, I would like to thank my fellow Members in the Committee on Budgetary Control and others in the House for their joint initiative over many years aimed at cleaning up the EU."
"When I first began, during the budget I met a person who was known as 'Skimmed milk'."
"He received DKK 1.3 billion and was the biggest Danish beneficiary of EU funds."
"I could not even obtain a statistical breakdown of what the biggest recipients of the money were receiving for example."
"From next year onwards, all recipients of agricultural support will be disclosed on the Internet."
"Four years ago the Commission's working groups were a big secret."
"Now we will also be able to see on the internet who the consultants are, thanks to our combined pressure. In addition, we have also enjoyed good support within the Commission from Mr Kallas."
"I would like to express my thanks for this."
"I will miss those I work with when I leave Parliament on 9 May."
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!"
"We have come a long way, but not yet far enough. However, I am certain that you will continue the work."
"Mr President, in 1944 Friedrich Hayek made the prescient observation that the delegation of particular technical tasks to separate bodies, while a regular feature, is the first step by which a democracy progressively relinquishes its powers."
"Colleagues should ask themselves how much democratic control there is over the various European agencies."
"We might get the odd committee visit to them, or express general opinions on what their mandates should be, but, in general, the role of this Parliament is to vote through the necessary supply, annually and unconditionally."
"Thus, the European Union is being run by a standing apparat."
"To be fair, it is not alone."
"Within many of the Member States, my own included, there has been a similar process, whereby elected representatives have given away their powers."
"What makes the EU unusual is that these various bodies have only the flimsiest of legal bases."
"True, they would have been authorised by the European Constitution."
"But that constitution - it seems necessary periodically to remind this House - was rejected at the ballot box."
"Therefore, many of these agencies - the Human Rights Agency, the Defence Agency, the External Borders Agency and so on - are at best irregular, and at worst illegal."
"If you want to regularise their status, and to have a proper mandate for them, then put the constitution to the people in the referendum you once promised."
"Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"(NL) Mr President, much has already been said today on the subject of Parliament's discharge."
"I would therefore like to limit myself to the observation that I, most certainly as a former assistant, hope that the assistants' statute, which has already been discussed in such detail, will finally materialise, because if we are honest, the current regulations offer too much room for manoeuvre."
"That is the problem."
"Many Members manage this correctly, yet there is no guarantee at present."
"The rules must therefore be tightened up and Parliament's departments will have to take more consistent action in cases where the rules are not correctly applied."
"This is an area in which our departments have sometimes made errors, including in the past."
"Having said that, I would like to focus on granting the Commission discharge and on what, in my opinion, is the main problem, which occurs every year and is the cause of many a headache: to be specific, the difficult position in which we currently find ourselves between European and national level; a position that is due to the fact that the Commission is fully accountable for European expenditures, whilst 80% of these are managed by the Member States."
"It has already been stated that there have indeed been positive developments, for example in the agricultural sector."
"However, the only way we can get ourselves out of this difficult position is via the national management declarations, which are already currently being submitted by four Member States."
"In the Jørgensen report, we as Parliament state in plain language that, in this regard, the current annual summaries are just an initial cautious step towards these management declarations."
"I am also aware, however, that an amendment of the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation is required in order to implement the national declarations."
"In any case, I am content for the moment with the Commission's promise of last month, that it will also encourage the other Member States to submit national declarations."
"I deliberately say 'content for the moment', Commissioner, because the proof of the pudding is in the eating and my group will follow up on how the Commission fulfils this promise by means of concrete actions in the coming months."
"Moreover, the fact that the Council is not present today indicates that a great deal has yet to be achieved."
"We will consider these conclusions, if we are here again next year for the 2007 discharge."
"To be continued then!"
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to discuss the European agencies report."
"Every year the European Parliament examines the management of the European agencies and relies on the work done by the European Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office to do so."
"As a result of our joint long, meticulous, analytical and preparatory work we are now in a position to give a decision on the 2006 management of the Community agencies and it is indeed fortunate that with the agreement of the European Court of Auditors we can propose all the agencies for acceptance."
"This does not mean that we did not find any faults in the management but that we did not find any faults serious enough to prevent acceptance."
"I would also like to point out that the political groupings have already voted in favour, with a wide democratic majority, and I now propose here, in plenary, that we accept the work of the agencies even if the rapporteur is not entirely at one with the report. Thank you for your attention."
"(LT) Mr President, since the beginning of the term of office, I have been analysing the results of the work of the EU agencies on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe."
"I would like to point out that the number of agencies has nearly doubled in the current year."
"Despite some critical remarks in the speech of the rapporteur regarding the work of these agencies, I find it necessary to mention certain positive changes compared with last year."
"There is an increase in transparency and democratic responsibility as a result of the implementation of Parliament's suggestion to have the agencies' work assessed by the relevant committees."
"Nevertheless, some problems still remain."
"In this regard we should determine the position of the agencies' activities within the EU management system."
"As I have already mentioned, the number of agencies has grown considerably and we get the blame for that; and even Parliament sometimes shares the opinion that it is an indirect way of increasing bureaucracy."
"Perhaps, however, it highlights the need to review the EU management system along with that of the European Commission, especially the system of management and administration."
"A series of projects are currently being implemented with the aim of improving the system."
"It seems that we should consider a more radical reform, which would yield positive results and contribute to achieving more transparency in the work of both the agencies and the Commission."
"(PL) Mr President, Commissioner, there are three matters to which I would like to draw attention in this debate."
"Although the Court of Auditors has acknowledged that in general terms the financial report of the European Communities is an honest representation of the financial situation at the end of December 2006, and that it did not find any flagrant inaccuracies concerning own funds and expenditure incurred, it did find many errors both in sums recorded in accounts ledgers and in reports supplied by the Member States."
"One cause for particular concern is that some types of inaccuracy are repeated year on year, despite critical comments from the Court of Auditors and the European Parliament."
"Another cause for concern is the continuing rise in outstanding budget commitments still to be paid, especially in respect of the old Member States."
"Thirdly, in view of those comments, I would like to record my satisfaction with the overall improvement in expenditure on the common agricultural policy, which has been achieved largely through application of the AJAX system, which significantly limits the risk of improper expenditure."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in 2006 the European Union devoted 39% of its budget, EUR 38.9 billion in all, to structural spending."
"The annual European Court of Auditors report established that the European Commission had taken numerous steps concerning the use of structural and cohesion funds as part of its far-reaching supervision."
"While financial absorption has manifestly improved, the report draws attention to the fact that in 2006 at least 12% of allocations to structural projects could not be recovered."
"This represents around EUR 4 billion, and there were performance errors with 20% of the projects."
"For years there have been numerous problems with the multi-layer management of the Structural Funds and their shared management."
"A cause of the relatively high proportion of the irregularities discovered and incorrect reimbursements is, primarily, the poor efficiency of the Member State control systems and the supervisory systems based on them."
"The greatest problem I see is that there is no unified evaluation model used by everyone, no yardstick or benchmarking system, and there is no effective way of measuring the projects."
"Although the Structural Funds are an extremely important source that can be allocated for mutual development, we can only attain a reduction in the number of abuses of the common purse if the Member States and the European Commission act jointly and in harmony to cut back on the illegal use of money."
"The efficiency of the Member States' supervisory systems also needs to be improved and standardised."
"Moreover, it is essential that the Commission makes its supervision of structural spending more effective, setting up suspension and adjustment procedures and developing a new Member State reporting system, bearing in mind that there are problems with 40% of the Commission audits."
"Given all this, our delegation proposes a discharge. Thank you for your attention."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to express our satisfaction as, for another year, transparency has been improved in the European Union accounts, despite the fact that, we have to say, the Court of Auditors is still helping us with the more fundamental aspects of the system."
"It is, however, true that, through a very constructive dialogue - arduous but very constructive - with the Commission, in which we must especially recognise the efforts made by the Commissioners for Regional Development and Employment, there has been real progress made on aspects of improving monitoring of all aspects related to both employment and the Structural Funds."
"We would have liked the same cooperation from the Commissioner on External Relations, who we hope will add to or join in these efforts."
"With regard to the Committee of the Regions, we are very happy, because we have really made very significant progress, and while we are continuing to evaluate and monitor affairs we feel that there has really been major progress."
"With regard to the Court of Auditors, we would like there to be greater transparency in its declaration of interests, and regarding the Council we agree with making internal auditing more transparent and efficient, but not with increasing bureaucratic obstacles, as the amendment tabled appears to suggest."
"Mr President, I have some questions."
"Why is it that, in a Parliament committed to openness and transparency, our own authorities keep secret embarrassing reports which reveal the fraudulent practices of Members?"
"Why is it that there was no requirement for Members to account for their use of general expenditure?"
"How much of that money ends up in private pockets?"
"Why do we keep secret the names of the 407 Members who benefit from EUR 27 000 each paid into a voluntary pension fund, amongst them myself?"
"Why do we have no controls over those Members who embezzle nearly EUR 14 000 each year by making private payments into that pension fund from the public purse?"
"Is there any reason, other than greed, that prevents those to whom we look for guidance - the Bureau and sometimes even the Conference of Presidents - introducing the genuine reforms that are so long overdue?"
"This failure brings shame upon us all and upon this House."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to add my voice to those giving a positive opinion of the discharge for 2006."
"Both the Commission and the Commissioners have distinguished themselves by their considerable and constantly rising level of cooperation."
"Thanks are very much due to the Court of Auditors."
"To put it simply, the Court has done its job well."
"We have assessed the achievement of goals in the EU together with the management of resources."
"This is also a very positive sign."
"I would like to emphasise most strongly that Parliament takes part de facto in the discharge procedure by giving verdicts on applications and through the individual committees that deal with particular areas."
"I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Bösch, for all the work and patience he has put in, as well as the rapporteurs, Mr Jørgensen, Mr Pomés Ruiz and Mr Stubb."
"It is exceptionally difficult to avoid irregularities, but it is even more important to find them and prevent them."
"We have successfully carried out this function."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"As the shadow rapporteur for the ENVI opinion (Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety) on exemption for 2006, I would like to thank Jutta Haug and the rapporteur for a very solid piece of work."
"I feel that the work of the four agencies we dealt with is extremely important, that what they do is without any doubt of great help to the European Parliament and the various EU bodies, and so improves the quality of life of EU citizens."
"The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control plays an important part in opinion formation on disease control and the risk of new and emerging infectious diseases."
"I could add my thanks that this year Hungary was first in disease prevention, as we had the smallest number of people infected with diseases against which there had been a vaccination campaign."
"The work of the European Environment Agency is indispensable in the gathering and collation of information on environmental protection, and the European Medicines Agency plays a significant role in the protection of public health and animal health."
"I feel the agency's collaboration in the development of new medicines is extremely important."
"The European Food Safety Authority offers indispensable support in the areas of animal health and plant protection."
"An important point is that all the agencies have redistributed their available annual budget."
"As the rapporteur points out, this is because of the complexity of the tasks."
"It would be useful to highlight this more in future planning."
"I welcome the rapporteur's proposals on the importance of internal control and the need to strengthen it."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to the importance of the committee material explaining the role of the agencies."
"The agencies have a necessary role to play, but transparency and effectiveness dictate the need for clarification of their place in the governance of the Union. Thank you."
"(HU) Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"We have arrived at the end of the long, tension-filled process and at today's long-anticipated vote on the 2006 discharge, which can deservedly be regarded as a red letter day and a milestone in the annals of the European Parliament."
"A red letter day, as this is the first time that the European Court of Auditors has confronted us all with the 12% fault rate for the Structural Funds, which the sensation-hungry tabloid press naturally dished up as four billion missing euros."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control, which has responsibility in this matter, carried out the resulting work in full awareness of its political and professional responsibilities, with the assistance of Mr Jørgensen, the Danish rapporteur."
"Its aim was not to cause a scandal or stir up a sensation with unforeseeable consequences, but to apply the principles of transparent disclosure and come up with proposals which would offer a guarantee for avoiding such problems in the future And here we found a very good partner in the person of Vice-President Siim Kallas, to whom I would like to give particular thanks, and I am sure that we will in all probability be able to resolve all such issues in the future."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to mention an aspect of importance concerning the discharge, namely the evaluation of actions through sampling."
"When I was preparing my working document on the Commission's management of the CARDS programme on assistance for the Balkans, as part of the discharge, only 2.32% of operations could be audited by the Court of Auditors in order to evaluate the management methods used by the European Union for external actions in this region of Europe."
"One of the effects of the small sample size was that the Court of Auditors was unable to analyse the impact of external action on Montenegro because, out of the 256 actions financed, not one was examined."
"Under these circumstances, how can impact really be measured?"
"What scientific and financial reliability should be accorded to these evaluation reports?"
"Although, from a statistical point of view, small samples can be used to estimate the behaviour of the systems, the samples still need to be representative, which was not the case with the appropriations used to finance actions in Montenegro under the CARDS programme."
"Collectively, European taxpayers would gain from an improvement in the Court of Auditor's methods for analysing samples in order to identify more clearly the effectiveness of appropriations from our budget."
"Mr President, I find myself in the very unusual situation of agreeing partly with something that Mr Hannan said just now, which was when he voiced his concern about the proliferation of agencies."
"We seem to create agencies more according to the desire of every Member State to have one on its territory, and then spread them like confetti around the Union, than according to a real and genuine need to do so."
"If this trend continues, it will indeed lead to governance by agency at the expense, frankly, of the Commission, which is our executive and which is accountable to Parliament, and much more directly than the agencies, even if we do have more means than Mr Hannan admitted to control them."
"Where I depart from him of course is when he goes over the top, as he usually does, and claims that these agencies have been created illegally."
"That is, of course, absolute nonsense."
"They were all created on the basis of the current Treaties, with a proper and due legal base."
"Whether it was wise to do so is another question, and we should certainly be very careful before we create any new agencies in the future."
"(EL) Mr President, the European Parliament is a political body and I think we ought to consider the issues we are debating in a political manner."
"The measure which ought to link our activities, in my view, tells us two things."
"Let me take two examples from our discussions."
"The first is the matter of independent authorities or agencies."
"Of course, there is the question of major expansion of all these agencies, but it is impossible to say that the decentralisation of the independent agencies is not particularly useful."
"As there is a problem with great expansion, we will say no to all the independent agencies?"
"Naturally this would not be possible."
"The second relates to the infamous issue of our colleagues' salaries."
"This certainly is a problem, and we said so in committee."
"There is a vast difference, however, between saying that there is a problem and not giving exemption to Parliament for an entire year, and also between making very populist remarks, such as that we are all responsible and that claiming that there is no transparency."
"How can there be no transparency?"
"We, the members of the committee, have seen the report."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I should like to thank the honourable Members, the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The discussion on discharge has been very intensive this year, and the Commission has made several commitments to follow up Parliament's observations and recommendations."
"We will continue this intensive process, starting in May, when there will be a discussion in the Committee on Budgetary Control about our plans for next year."
"This is an intensive process, and I would like to assure Parliament that we take our commitments very seriously and are going ahead with the proposals and ideas we have in common on increasing accountability, on cooperation with Member States and on increasing the responsibility of Member States in shared management issues."
"That is our common line, and we will work seriously on all those action plans and proposals."
"There are different types of agencies."
"Firstly, there are executive agencies, which are clearly the responsibility of the Commission, and for which you give discharge to the Commission."
"We have some executive agencies, but have decided to have a moratorium on the establishment of new executive agencies."
"What are the concerns surrounding traditional agencies?"
"The problem of governance is a serious one, and there are several weak points as regards how to administer and handle those agencies."
"We should probably hold serious discussions on governance issues, but we should also not underestimate the political observations on their work - what they are doing and what the real benefits are - and Parliament has a very important role to play in evaluating and assessing how successful they are."
"Neither should we underestimate the positive aspects of both decentralisation and of having European bodies spread across Europe."
"That is not such a bad idea, if everybody considers his or her own country."
"I should like to thank you once again for all your contributions, remarks, debates and discussions."
"We will continue with our commitments and action plans."
"rapporteur. - (DA) Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Kallas."
"It is clear that we have been through a process where the waves have been a little choppy at times."
"There has been conflict between ourselves in Parliament and the Commission. However, it is a conflict that we have managed to transform into a dialogue."
"It has led to some good results and some good pledges from the Commission, and also to some very concrete action plans with specific deadlines and specific success criteria."
"We must persist during times when some Members from the more EU-sceptic groups say: 'it is just words, and words that have been said before'."
"This is not true!"
"It is certainly not just about words, but about specific actions, which the Commission is now promising to implement."
"Some measures have already been implemented."
"In addition, some very specific deadlines have also been established, which we will be able to monitor."
"A key element is that we will now have a commissioner who will meet with the committee once a month in order to follow this process."
"This really is a great stride forward."
"That said, by way of conclusion I would like to remind people why these problems arise."
"One of the reasons is that a considerable proportion of the funds is administered under shared management, i.e. 80% of the EU's funds are managed by the Member States."
"It is the responsibility of the Commission to follow the Treaty and it is a cross that it must bear."
"Therefore, we strongly criticise the Commission. However, in reality, much of the problem lies with the Member States."
"This is the reason why here in Parliament we are such staunch supporters of the idea of annual national audit declarations, signed at the appropriate political level, i.e. by the finance minister."
"This is happening already in a number of countries: Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Sweden."
"If we could achieve something similar in all EU countries, we would find that these auditing obligations would be taken more seriously in the individual countries."
"I think that we would actually gain a really good tool for eliminating those areas where things are not working in the individual countries."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, sometimes we cannot see the wood for the trees."
"In this discharge procedure we have to say what is going wrong, and sometimes we forget how many things are going well, how many extremely competent staff we have in the Commission and in this House, in Parliament, including the ushers, so many services, the translators, the interpreters , who provide an excellent service."
"We forget how we are able to stretch the budget that we have in order to fulfil our objectives, how Parliament and the Commission have made more and more progress on the transparency policy."
"There is still a challenge, a very important challenge for Parliament, which is the communication and information policy."
"It was one of the objectives that Parliament had for 2006, and I am not happy with how it has developed."
"We have elections in a year's time, and we need to know how to get there, which means improving our information procedures and continuing to be transparent, as we are being."
"Transparency, and I was rapporteur for this report, is compatible with having documents that are not public, as occurs in the Member States, for journalists, in businesses and in families."
"It is good for our work if there are levels of drafting criteria that have not passed through the sieve of public approval, and must therefore logically be the secret of those of us who are working on the matter."
"I am entirely satisfied with the access that I have had to all of the information, and I think that the report that I am presenting on Parliament's accounts is a responsible report."
"I say that Parliament's accounts should be discharged, because Parliament, if you will allow me to say so, operates very well, and much better than some national parliaments, in a much more transparent way and with staff who work more hours than may be worked in similar parliaments."
"This is not to say, therefore, that it is perfect: we need to keep working."
"We still have a long way to go, but in this political year, we have a positive picture of how we have used the money that our citizens have given us; we have used it well, transparently and coherently."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Jutta Haug described my critical comments in the explanatory statement and in the main text as abhorrent and as scandal-mongering."
"I would like to read out a few quotations: 'The Heads of State and Government are inventing one agency after another."
"The agencies are eating up our money."
"There are no proper checks as to whether the agencies are really necessary."
"There is an extensive area free of control where nobody is really accountable."
"No planning is apparent."
"One agency after another is created, in order to be paid for consent to difficult topics by an undertaking for an interesting agency.'"
"These are all quotations from Herbert Bösch."
"They are much more critical than what I wrote."
"Aha!"
"When I write it, it is called 'scandal-mongering', but Herbert Bösch, or course, is a member of the party and fits in with it."
"Yes, I have experienced this before."
"This is what I mean when I talk about the 'doublespeak' that rules here."
"This is the hypocrisy of the 'special' class, that people say 'it is dreadful to mention a scandal explicitly in an official Parliamentary paper' but then make critical comments publicly."
"This is one of the fundamental problems in this Parliament."
"Naturally, people may have different opinions on whether or not to grant discharge, but that is not what these passages, which I read out at the beginning, were about - not at all."
"Rather, they were about basic considerations where, when it comes down to it, there is a real opportunity to show their true colours, people once again cover up what is going on here."
"That is the truly great problem for democracy in Europe, that the system here is not self-regulating, that it merely involves mutual backslapping."
"Mr President, I would also like to ask to be allowed to make a personal statement under Article 145 at the end of the debate."
"rapporteur. - (SV) I would like to take this opportunity to provide a little constructive criticism to the Commission and to the decentralised agencies, as I still think that the rapporteur, Hans-Peter Martin, has not managed to do so."
"As the rapporteur responsible for this question next year, I would like to focus on three main issues."
"They are also raised in the reports."
"The first is evaluating the opportunities of grouping together the administrative functions of a majority of the smaller agencies, and so releasing resources and expertise in complying with the complicated regulatory framework surrounding the agencies."
"Many of these decentralised agencies have problems complying with overriding budgetary principles, for example, or the Financial Regulation, procurement legislation, etc. This is a recurring opinion here, and one which I hope the Commission will take further."
"We also propose that the independent agencies, like other institutions, have their staff appropriations reduced by a percentage equivalent to posts which it is believed will not be filled."
"I believe that this too could free up considerable resources."
"Last but not least, we propose that the assigned revenue which agencies pay in to the Commission each year and which is returned be deducted against the proposal in the budget on which the European Parliament is reaching a decision."
"These are the three issues on which I would like to enter into an ongoing dialogue with the Commission and the decentralised agencies during this period, until I take over the discharge process."
"Finally, I would also like to say something about the Court of Auditors' special report on the control, inspection and sanction systems relating to the rules on conservation of Community fisheries resources."
"It is, after all, part and parcel with discharge of the Commission which we are addressing today, and the Court of Auditors delivers a devastating criticism, which must lead to wide-ranging reform of the common fisheries policy."
"Three conclusions which I have drawn, and which can also be found in the report we will be voting on, are first and foremost that it is unacceptable for Member States, year after year, to set quotas at a higher level than recommended by researchers for sustainable fisheries, secondly that the Commission and the Member States must be tougher when it comes to combating breaches of or fraud against the quota system and, thirdly, that we must draw up a new fisheries policy which strengthens the incentives and reasons for professional fishermen to protect stocks."
"These are three additional thoughts which I would like you to take seriously in the report we are voting on today."
"rapporteur. - (DE) You cut me off, Mr President, when I called you a despot."
"I would like to justify why I do that."
"I have been waiting for this answer since March 2007, in relation to a very, very important matter regarding an error by this Parliament which is serious for me personally and for my political work - when I was assigned to a group against which I have always fought, because I hold them to be Nazis in disguise - and I made a lengthy personal submission to you."
"In the meantime, I have lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman."
"When it comes to one-minute speeches, Mr President, you have all your constructions off pat, and when it is supposed to be my turn, you do not allow me to take my turn, so I call you a despot."
"I also call you a despotic President because you arbitrarily singled out certain Members in the so-called incidents on 12 December, not those who were members of the party you still belonged to at the time, but apparently those who caught your eye."
"I also call you a despot because you keep on cutting me off while I am speaking and say 'no, you will not give me that answer'."
"It is surprising that you are letting me finish speaking now."
"Furthermore, I call you a despotic president because, on the basis of this additional enabling interpretation, and I am not the only one who believes this is untenable, procedures can in fact take place here that truly have no place in a proper Parliament, at least not the way I learned about it in school."
"However, for me, that is a very long time ago - if you read my curriculum vitae - to make me choose such an expression. A great deal must have taken place for that to happen."
"I am, however, convinced that you allow this despotic approach precisely because in fact it was not a matter of seeking clarification on the question of the secretarial assistance allowance."
"You allowed me to be put in the pillory due to ludicrous errors of form that could happen to anybody - yes anybody, and I am sure they happen to every Member of this House."
"However, they obscure the fact that, according to internal investigations, at least EUR 80 million would have to be claimed back from Members of Parliament if there were equal treatment and proportionality of funds."
"These do not exist and therefore I maintain that indeed, in my opinion, you - as the political representative of 14% of Austrian voters - are, unfortunately, a despotic president who is inflicting unnecessary damage on this Parliament and the important underlying idea of Europe."
"I long to see a true, fair, democratic Parliament, where it would be neither necessary nor desirable to use such an expression."
"Mr Martin, we are a free Parliament."
"Therefore, as is my duty, I allowed you to speak, in accordance with Rule 145."
"I do not wish to pass judgement on your explanation, merely to observe that I applied the Rules of Procedure fairly in order to give you the opportunity to say what you have said."
"On my own behalf, I would say that I try to be just and objective - and that I achieve that - in my dealings with all Members of Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."

"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, there has actually been an error with the numbers, and what we are going to vote on first, by means of a separate vote, is paragraph 65, except for indent 4, and we will then have a roll-call vote on indent 4."
"There has been a change of numbers, it is that simple."
"That is right, Mr Pomés, therefore let us proceed with the vote on paragraph 65, except for indent 4."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 9:"
"(SV) Mr President, under paragraph 65 we had no vote on indent 5."
"We voted separately on number four, but not on number five."
"Mr Andersson, there are different language versions, and what we have voted on, what you are alluding to, was already included."
"So that there are no doubts, we are now going to vote solely on what Mr Andersson was saying, that is 'no relatives of Members be employed'."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 72:"
"(DE) Mr President, even if it is too late to say so, I think that the Member's objection may have been misunderstood."
"He wanted a vote on Paragraph 65, fifth indent."
"You had a vote on whether family members may be employed."
"Paragraph 65, fifth indent does not regulate that, but whether payments can be suspended in the event that there is suspicion of malpractice."
"We did not vote on that, or you announced something incorrectly."
"Just so that we clear that up, so that everyone knows what is happening."
"Mr Alvaro, the problem is that, in the different language versions, this phrase was structured in a different way."
"This is what has created problems."
"We have therefore voted saying exactly what we were voting for, so that there are no doubts."
"Do you understand, Mr Alvaro?"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to point out that those who prepared the voting lists were aware of the problem, so that the marks that you have in the voting list already take into account the different linguistic problems."
"That is to say, it was totally clear how the groups were voting. It is not the case that nobody knew what was being voted upon."
"We tried to correct this in the Tabling Office, and it was corrected."
"In any case the vote was clear, so there is no problem at all."

"Voting time (continuation)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(PL) Mr President, new forms of crime and specialised criminal groups of an international nature present an enormous challenge to prosecuting agencies in the Member States."
"Effective prosecution of offenders and the fight against the most alarming manifestations of lawbreaking are not possible without the creation of appropriate tools that the police can use to enforce the law. In the case of a problem such as cross-border crime, the rapid exchange of information between services in individual countries is essential if offenders are to be identified and actions coordinated."
"DNA databases and digital fingerprint records are a very important tool in the fight against crime. They enable an offender to be identified regardless of where the crime was committed."
"The Dührkop Dührkop report on the stepping up of cooperation between prosecution agencies in combating terrorism and cross-border crime is a valuable initiative that reinforces the action in favour of greater security for US citizens that was initiated in 2005 by the Prüm Treaty."
"Mr President, as we know, this report calls for an extension of the Prüm Treaty into the fight against cross-border terrorism."
"We all agree on the need to combat terrorism."
"That goes without saying."
"We all agree on the need for cross-border cooperation."
"However, the Prüm Treaty is about the enforced sharing of data, regardless of concerns over the protection and security of that data."
"Judging by the newspaper stories on the integrity of police forces in certain Member States, we should all be concerned about that sharing of data."
"The actual content of the report would in fact significantly breach the civil liberties of citizens right across the EU, because the collection and passing-on of DNA data to other EU Member States becomes obligatory for the first time."
"We are sleepwalking into a 'Big Brother' Europe, while our politicians stand idly by."
"It was for this reason that we voted against this report."
"(PL) Mr President, the role of the Ombudsman is increasing, especially in the context of the solutions and challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"We want to build a Europe for citizens, a Europe that is close to its citizens, a Europe that will be a model of observance of human rights and respect, so contact procedures and also procedures for cooperation between citizens and the Ombudsman institution should be made easier."
"The time taken for matters to be examined at Ombudsman level should be reduced to the bare minimum."
"I would also like to draw attention to the principles of cooperation between national Ombudsmen and the European Ombudsman on the principle of subsidiarity."
"A division of roles and tasks will improve the efficiency of both of these institutions."
"(SK) I voted for the report by my fellow Member Mr Adamou on organ donation and transplantation."
"We need to tackle the problem of the shortage of organs for transplants in Europe, which is the chief factor affecting transplantation programme."
"There are some 60 000 patients in need of transplants on waiting lists across Europe."
"Mortality rates while waiting for a heart, liver or lung transplant usually range from 15% to 30%."
"According to a 2006 Eurobarometer poll, 56% of Europeans wish to donate their organs for transplantation purposes after their death."
"People should be encouraged to speak about organ donation and to communicate their wishes to their relatives."
"The training of medical experts should also be improved."
"Statistics show that up to 81% of citizens of the European Union Member States support the use of a donor card, which makes it easier to identify the donor. In spite of that only 12% of Europeans have this card at present."
"I support the Commission's initiative to launch the European Donor Card."
"(PL) Mr President, human life and health constitute the highest value for those responsible for health services in the Member States."
"All steps aimed at protecting them should meet with the express approval of the European Parliament."
"Transplantology is one of the most rapidly growing branches of medicine."
"Thousands of people are given the chance to return to life, the chance, as it were, of a second life."
"The number of transplants carried out in the European Union in relation to the number of people awaiting them is still inadequate, and many patients awaiting a transplant die before an operation can be performed because of a lack of organs."
"Action aimed at increasing the number of transplants performed is particularly important."
"One of the key methods of doing this is to promote transplantology among the public and to encourage potential donors to express their consent to their organs being taken after death."
"It is also important to set up and monitor an extensive system to control transplants carried out, in order to combat the unpleasant illegal trade in organs, which is not just the province of the poor regions of the world."
"In my view, the Adamou report is an important signal for Member States who are stressing the gravity of the problem."
"(PL) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report, as this is an exceptionally important, albeit difficult problem."
"The declaration of one's willingness to have one's organs transferred after death for transplantation into others is a gift of life; it is saving the lives of other people; it is something of exceptional worth to mankind."
"It should be pointed out that there is a link between the shortage of organs and the illegal trade in them."
"An organ deficiency sometimes prompts people to break the law and acquire organs illegally in order to save a life."
"This is an ethical and moral problem as well as a legal one."
"High requirements in terms of quality and safety in the fields of donation and the taking, testing, storage and transport of organs are not subject to discussion, as they constitute the basis for the success of a transplant."
"Finally, we must bear in mind that an effective information policy at EU level must be conducted in order to increase our citizens' awareness of this subject."
"The problem in question should be a fundamental challenge for the Member States."
"Finally, the problem we are discussing today demands appropriate debate, further research, as well as solutions of a moral and ethical nature."
"(CS) I would like to thank my fellow Members for supporting the European People's Party proposals concerning Europol and research."
"We are disappointed that Europol under-estimated the importance of monitoring international human organ trafficking."
"Even in Europe children vanish because of trade in organs, and not only in China but in Moldova, too, human organs are bought and subsequently sold at a high price to Europeans on the black market."
"This is of course why Europol must monitor the situation."
"We cannot prevent international transplant tourism without better coordination of the transplantation programmes across the Union."
"To achieve this, we must first of all agree on a common approach regarding informed consent for organ donation."
"I personally believe that experiments in the area of human embryo transfers are unethical and irresponsible."
"On the other hand, clinical research on adult stem cell produces excellent results in tissue transplantation, for example for heart patients, and this procedure does not violate respect for the uniqueness of human beings."
"Our report sends a strong signal to the Commission, which will soon proposal for a binding text."
"Mr President, in addressing the subject of the report on organ donation, I wish to pay tribute to my former assistant, James Sullivan, who, as many of you will know, died tragically on 10 February."
"In our office on 8 February, James and Aoife, another assistant, talked about presumed consent and agreed that should anything happen to either of them - both young people - they would donate their organs."
"We were not to know that tragically that night James would fall, and that on the Sunday the life-support machine would be switched off."
"It is a tribute to James that there are people across the European Union who now live because of his generosity."
"For his parents, Edna and Tom, in Cork in Ireland, who mourn his passing and who will never recover from his loss, the only hope they can hold on to is that James is no longer with us but that, owing to his generosity, others have lived."
"Obviously, this is a very personal report for our office, and I support it fully."
"(PL) Mr President, the donation and transplantation of organs is one of the fundamental problems requiring consideration and consensus both within the European Union and outside it."
"On the one hand we have tens of thousands of people awaiting transplants."
"On the other we have a serious medical, legal and ethical/moral problem."
"We are all agreed that an effective transplantation system needs to be developed."
"A transplantation system cannot become an economic category and lead to organs being treated as goods on an internal market."
"If this were to happen, criminal groups would spring up that would take advantage of poverty and distress and thus deepen the exploitation of human beings, especially in regions affected by large-scale unemployment, deprivation and hunger."
"Mr Heaton-Harris, regarding the meaning of 'GNSS', we now have two options: one is 'Galileo Navigation Satellite System' and the other is 'Global Navigation Satellite System'."
"Which one do you prefer, Mr Heaton-Harris?"
"Mr President, do you know, I have never had any sort of power in this place before!"
"I think I would like to opt for 'Great British' - but no, we will go for 'global'."
"I am pretty sure it is 'global'."
"I was going to mention that in my Agency explanation of vote."
"I shall now talk on the Commission's discharge for just one minute."
"As I have done every time since I entered this place, I voted against the discharge for the European Commission."
"I recognise that a lot of work has been going on within the Commission to try and sort out its own accounts."
"However, the work has been going on in systems, it has not been going on within the culture that operates within the European Commission. There is still to this day a culture of 'let's keep our heads down and not report wrongdoings' in the European Commission."
"Occasionally we all meet people working within the Commission who are able to tell us off-the-record things that should not be happening there, but will not go on the record and report it to the heads of their DGs."
"I know this place does not like turning down discharges."
"It is a great shame because there is no political consequence."
"We had a legal opinion on that seven years ago."
"As I say, I voted against and I shall continue to do so in my time in this place."
"Mr President, I voted for the 2006 discharge of the European Parliament, but against the marathon resolution which accompanied it, because it contains comments and questions that either state the obvious (paragraph 58), or do not uphold values which I consider important (paragraph 65)."
"To think that the majority of this Parliament has just voted that members cannot employ their spouse, but can employ their lover, mistress or toy boy."
"Personally I have none of these, but I would still like to point out how absurd it is."
"In my intervention earlier, I tried to correct the inaccurate claims about the voluntary pension fund, as did the fund chairman throughout the procedure."
"Sadly this was to no avail."
"In paragraph 71, the authors criticise the fact that the fund did not update its actuarial calculations to the end of December 2007 by 15 March 2008."
"Apart from the fact that it is absurd for a report on 2006 to demand the presentation of accounts for 2007, I can reassure the authors."
"The update for 2007 has been done, but it will first be presented to the board of directors of the fund, which is a Luxembourg non-profit organisation."
"Mr President, can I just add that to err is human; to persist is of the devil."
"Since I am not devilish, I voted against."
"(RO) In the Pomés Ruiz report Section I - European Parliament, I voted in favour of the amendment forbidding European Parliament members to employ family members."
"I believe this is correct text and I welcome the fact that the European Parliament plenary adopted this text."
"The reasons are very simple: in some European Union Member States, including the country I come from, Romania, there is a debate regarding the credibility of parliamentary institutions and even of parliaments."
"I think this is the correct position especially since, and I will give an example, including in the country I come from, Romania, the head of state himself has often had the political objective to make the institution of the Parliament and parliamentary action less credible, starting with errors or vulnerabilities related to the activity of the Member of Parliament."
"This is the reason why, I repeat, I welcome the adoption of this text that could lead, together with other actions, to an increase in the prestige and credibility of Parliamentary institutions in the Member States and at a European level."
"I voted against Parliament's discharge in the light of many of the press reports that have stemmed from an internal audit report drawn up by Parliament's services."
"This report has yet to be published and put out into the public domain."
"It says that there are some problems with what Members do with their different allowances in this place."
"I think, as Members, we should all be as open and transparent as we possibly can."
"The best way to have dealt with the report would have been to put it in the public domain, because then people would have realised that it is not millions of pounds that are at issue, but a very small amount of money - still worth chasing and policing, and giving the Members that abuse the system a great deal of hassle and taking them to the courts over, but not as bad as the general public now think this whole place is."
"So I voted against, because I think we should publish this report."
"I hope that Parliament's services, when advising the President of Parliament on any future reports, go for maximum transparency and publish as much as possible in the future."
"Mr President, I could have given an explanation of vote on every agency, but in fact you made my point for me in the voting session."
"There are now so many agencies that not all of us know what they are and what they do."
"In fact, I am surprised that anybody in the House, apart from those who sat on the appropriate committee, knew what the GNSS Supervisory Authority does, or even what its budget was."
"I have great concerns that some of these agencies that we have voted to discharge the accounts for do not actually have any legal basis until the Lisbon Treaty is passed by all Member States."
"I wonder where the legal basis of the European Agency for Fundamental Rights comes from, for example."
"So we are now passing accounts for agencies that do not have a legal basis in this place, and no one particularly cares."
"I find that quite upsetting."
"I think the European taxpayer would find it quite bemusing, and I happily vote against these agencies, because I think they are anti-democratic."
"I think that, if we are going to take responsibility for things, it should be done on the floor of this place and not by hiving off powers to quangos that we do not police properly."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, clearly I have become an unknown face since I have no longer been making explanations of vote in all the sittings, because I asked if I could explain the reason for my vote on the report by Marian Harkin, and the official made a note of it but I have not been called."
"Perhaps he did not know who I was."
"Mr President, you are the best of all the vice-presidents and I would like to thank you for this because you are allowing me to convey the fact that I am very much in favour of the report by Marian Harkin, which underlines the importance of volunteering in the European Union."
"You know that the elderly, pensioners, have a lot of free time available and many of them use it for the benefit of their neighbours, for the benefit of other citizens, both in Europe and elsewhere."
"I am delighted that the Commission is being called upon to add the Seniors in Action Programme to the Youth in Action Programme, as I have been saying in the Chambers of this Parliament for many years, so I am delighted to say that finally much good is being done for the voluntary and seniors sector in the European Parliament."
"Thank you very much, Mr Fatuzzo."
"Do you want your comment that I am the best vice-president to be recorded in the Minutes?"
"Well, if you insist, we will record it in the Minutes."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (SV) We voted in favour of the report, as it is of the utmost importance to strengthen and improve the efficiency of cooperation between Member States in combating terrorism and cross-border crime."
"Parliament's report improves the wording on citizens' rights with a high level of data protection compared with the German initiative."
"This is good."
"Unfortunately, however, the report contains wordings on the processing of specific data concerning racial or ethnic origin, etc, and on the powers of foreign officials regarding arrest and questioning during joint operations."
