"To subjugate citizens in this way, to make them mere balancing items in an inefficient, unhealthy system, tools used to serve the interests of the financial elites, without showing any consideration for, and by endangering, their lives, what is that if not the equivalent of the ownership of human beings that is slavery?"
"While crime must indeed be combated, it is just as necessary to combat institutionalised wrongdoing and to make the European Union a union for the emancipation of citizens."
"in writing. - (PT) Trafficking in people violates the most basic human rights and is a form of slavery based on sexual and labour exploitation."
"International estimates state that trafficking in people is the third most lucrative illegal trade."
"Now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, European Union action on judicial and police cooperation has clearly been strengthened."
"The fight against trafficking in human beings must be one of the main aims of the European Union and Parliament's role as colegislator means that it will have to play a central role in this."
"The fight against trafficking in human beings should therefore continue be one of the EU's top priorities, even in times of economic and financial crisis."
"Human trafficking is one of the greatest plagues of the beginning of this century."
"Those who call it a modern form of slavery cannot be accused of exaggeration."
"It is an activity which is exceptionally profitable, and is controlled by dangerous, organised criminal gangs."
"I fully endorse the motion for a resolution on preventing trafficking in human beings, which was submitted by a broad coalition of the European Parliament's political groups."
"It is my opinion that the European Commission is obliged to develop a plan of action to eliminate human trafficking effectively."
"At the same time, I fully support the appeal of the authors of the resolution on the appointment of an EU anti-trafficking coordinator under the Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship."
"I hope this will provide a new stimulus to intensify action against human trafficking."
"Human trafficking is a growing market, comparable nowadays to drug or arms trafficking, and is a phenomenon which has spread all over the world, but is more acute in underdeveloped countries."
"According to the report from the UN Working group, victims of trafficking come from different social backgrounds, from the most well-off to the poorest, from the best-educated to totally illiterate, from an early age to older women."
"We need to coordinate information better in order to combat this growing phenomenon more effectively."
"In this respect, it would be useful if Eurojust, Europol and Frontex could publish a joint report every year on human trafficking."
"If the European Union wants to take the lead on respecting human rights, it should be more actively involved in cooperating with third countries in order to help put a stop to this phenomenon."
"Furthermore, there is also a need for better funding for the programmes aimed at combating human trafficking and for more effective coordination between the institutions in Member States involved in the fight against trafficking in human beings."
"Human trafficking is the most flagrant form of human rights violation."
"The number of victims of this modern form of slavery rises from year to year."
"The detection rate for this type of crime is very low."
"Therefore, I endorse the resolution of the European Parliament on preventing trafficking in human beings."
"Human trafficking must be fought using all possible means, beginning with a thorough and comprehensive information campaign to show the scale of the phenomenon and make society sensitive to the issue."
"Giving incidental, individual items of information about cases of human trafficking which have been uncovered is not sufficient."
"Every time, it is also essential to give the addresses of institutions involved in the fight against this practice."
"A report presented in January 2010 by the Legal Aid Centre and the La Strada Foundation entitled 'Preventing Trafficking in Women from Central and Eastern Europe."
"Information - Prevention - Identification - Intervention' points out that, in Poland, procedures to guarantee the victims of human trafficking their rights are not being applied."
"One of the biggest problems is the protracted work on adding a modern definition of human trafficking to the Penal Code."
"In 2005, the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings was signed in Warsaw."
"It took lawyers as long as three years to ratify it."
"Today, we still do not have a binding definition of human trafficking, which hinders preparatory and judicial proceedings, and so hinders the observance of human rights in Poland."
"My vote in favour should not, however, be seen as support for the amendments in the resolution which involve the transfer of more power from the Member States to the EU, such as:"
"allowing the EU to set tougher sanctions in this area,"
"references to the Treaty of Lisbon strengthening EU action in criminal matters,"
"and the establishment of a superordinate legislative framework in this area."
"I voted in favour of resolution, Trafficking in human beings, because it concerns a very important matter and points out a long list of things that need to be done in the fight against human trafficking."
"However, my support for the resolution is not to be seen as support for the proposals in the resolution that involve more power being transferred from the Member States to the EU, such as allowing the EU to set tougher sanctions in this area, the reference to the Treaty of Lisbon strengthening EU action in criminal matters and the establishment of superordinate legislation in this area."
"I voted in favour of the resolution because I personally am involved in the fight against trafficking in human beings in Slovakia."
"It was I who launched the campaign 'Do you know where your child is now?'"
"Also, the committee of women adopted an amendment during the debate on the budgetary procedure to launch a multiannual media campaign entitled 'Do you know where your child is now', in close cooperation with civil society organisations, in order to increase awareness in terms of parental responsibility, improve protection for children against all forms of violence and fight trafficking in children more effectively."
"This new resolution, which I welcome with all my heart, is broken down along five major lines: general, information gathering, prevention, prosecution and protection, support and assistance for victims."
"The Commission is called upon to take initiatives, especially on information and prevention, in order to identify the root causes of trafficking and the factors in countries of origin and destination that facilitate trafficking in human beings."
"I am relying on parents being made aware of their serious parental responsibility towards their children, in order to prevent children and adolescents from falling victim to trafficking in human beings."
"in writing. - UKIP believes that environmental protection is important."
"Whilst we dispute the scientific premise the Copenhagen talks were based on, we have no objection to measures taken at nation state level to protect the environment."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of this resolution as I believe that the EU needs to create a new development paradigm in order to tackle climate change."
"The next revised version of the budget must provide sufficient resources for measures that can meet this important challenge."
"We cannot lose sight of our commitment to combating climate change."
"As Europeans, we must commit to a target reduction in CO2 of more than 20% by 2010."
"The cooperation of other world partners would also be important in order to achieve an ambitious, comprehensive and legally binding agreement in accordance with the aim of avoiding warming of more than 2 Â°C. I also believe that the initiatives being devised within the EU to promote and encourage the green economy, energy security and reducing dependence must remain a priority."
"The EU could draw inspiration for its policies from my region, the Azores, about 30% of whose energy already comes from renewable sources."
"Both Europe and the rest of the world invested much hope in the Copenhagen conference."
"The EU was ready to become the leader of this meeting and return with a legally binding treaty, but the meeting ended with very little clarity on how the fight against climate change should develop further."
"The Copenhagen agreement, which provides neither ambitious objectives nor commitments, is an unsatisfactory result."
"The EU's ambitious 20-20-20 may simply remain a distant dream if this matter is not resolved at global level."
"The EU, with its External Action Service, must begin to lead the strategy on diplomacy in the area of climate change as soon as possible and ensure that, above all, Europe speaks with one voice in talks with other countries and maintains the principled position, so that there can be a compulsory international climate change agreement as quickly as possible."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the adoption of the motion for a resolution on the results of the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15), which I co-authored, and the results of the negotiations between the various political groups, as they are representative of the increasingly generalised interest in this area, with a sustainable future as its objective."
"Once again, I would like to voice my disappointment with the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, and I call upon the EU to resume its leading role in the fight against climate change and contribute to bringing about a legally binding agreement with measurable, communicable and verifiable reduction aims at COP 16, to take place this year in Mexico."
"If European industry is to be more competitive and create more jobs, it is essential to invest in a sustainable future that will encompass climate protection, energy security, a reduction in energy independence and the efficient use of resources."
"In view of this, I call upon industrialised countries to invest more in research into new technologies, with the aim of both reducing CO2 and bringing about a more efficient and sustainable use of natural resources."
"The motion contains positive elements, such as acknowledging the lack of medium- and long-term objectives and the vague and poor funding for developing countries."
"However, I abstained from voting, because all the amendments by my group, seeking further measures to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2020 on the basis of a legally binding agreement, the rejection of nuclear energy as a 'clean' energy, more financial aid for poor and developing countries for development and transfer of technology and a socially viable green economy which can strengthen investments and employment and improve quality of life were voted down, and also because the important amendment proposing a 0.01% tax on financial transactions, which could bring in EUR 20 000 million a year to help developing countries combat climate change and adapt to it, was not approved."
"We cannot be driven to Mexico by the vague and disheartening Copenhagen agreement."
"We need to radically review the policy on climate change so that there is a proper agreement at the forthcoming negotiations."
"This can only be achieved by recognising and correcting the mistakes in Copenhagen, which the European Parliament resolution fails to do."
"The fact that the summit in Copenhagen is generally described as a 'deplorable failure' of an attempt to reach a global agreement on limiting the greenhouse emissions which are heating up the Earth's climate only serves to highlight the total lack of coordination among EU Member States with regard to the US and the emerging countries."
"The Copenhagen agreement does not even set a target in terms of an acceptable limit for the global temperature increase."
"However, I am hoping for a positive outcome and a strong European voice on limiting the effects of climate change at the meeting which will take place in February of next year, when the world's nations are called to present their plans on how they intend to cut emissions by 2020."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the joint resolution on the results of the Copenhagen conference as I broadly agree with the content of the proposed measures, and two in particular."
"The first of these is the absolute necessity for the EU to speak with one voice in international negotiations, as only then can we secure world leadership in dealing with this important issue."
"This matter will have repercussions for generations to come and so requires firm, guiding, immediate and sensible action such as the EU has taken with other issues, for example, the financial crisis."
"A new 'climate diplomacy' is required to achieve this purpose."
"The efforts of not only the EU, but also of China and the US, are essential to this, as explained in points 5 and 15 of the document."
"The second point I wish to emphasise is the need for developing countries/emerging economies to adopt the rules on climate change that apply to EU Member States."
"In the light of this, I and some of my colleagues have advocated the introduction of a carbon tax on the import of products from third countries so that this idea can progress towards being considered in future, which I think is a particularly important step."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the results of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change."
"The outcome of the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) was disappointing."
"The European Union therefore needs to make every effort in foreign diplomacy and speak with one voice so as to secure a legally binding international agreement on climate change which will allow a maximum increase in global temperature of 2 Â°C."
"in writing. - (PT) Following the stalemate of the Copenhagen conference on climate change, it is important that the European Union persists along the route it has taken up to this point in terms of making a serious commitment to sustainable development and trying to reduce carbon emissions without jeopardising European industry."
"New climate policies, particularly within the context of the general crisis, must not lose sight of economic efficiency and must not in any way call into question the economic sustainability of European nations."
"For this reason, I urge a new approach to energy policy, one which is based on clean energy, more efficient use of the natural resources at our disposal and strong investment in research and more environmentally friendly technologies so that we can maintain European competitiveness and allow job creation within a framework of sustainable development."
"in writing. - (PT) The EU has always acted as a leader in international negotiations on climate change."
"However, despite its ambition, the last climate conference in Copenhagen was a failure for all those who were determined to reach a binding agreement."
"This result is far from the EU's position on the matter, and it is also far from what is needed to protect the climate."
"Given the disappointing outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, Parliament wants to send a clear signal to the European public and the world that it remains committed to fighting climate change."
"We are now preparing the way for the next conference in Mexico, where there should be a greater effort towards commitment from all parties."
"We cannot repeat the same errors that occurred in Copenhagen."
"We must ask ourselves what went wrong during those negotiations and think about how to proceed if we are to include the US, China and India."
"in writing. - (PT) The resolution under discussion does not go on to critically assess the reasons for the failure of Copenhagen, which is necessary."
"Instead of seriously analysing the part that the EU itself played in this failure, the majority of this House persists in picking scapegoats such as China (whose per capita atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide are less than half those of the EU), and now the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America."
"This position is based solely on the blindness and partisanship of the most prominent politicians, and it undermines and subverts what actually happened in Copenhagen."
"Importantly, it insists on the effectiveness of market instruments such as trading in emission licences, while ignoring their ineffectiveness and the perversity that has already been shown in their use."
"Once again, necessary discussion about the so-called flexible mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism goes by the wayside."
"At the same time, the need to respect the sovereignty of developing countries in defining and implementing the so-called adaptation strategies is rejected."
"No fair and sustainable solution to the problem of climate change or other environmental problems can come out of the irrational system that caused them in the first place."
"What we need is another economic and social model that opposes capitalism."
"This resolution testifies to the fact that 'believers' in the IPCC's views have not understood anything."
"The main weakness of COP 15 was a failure to appreciate: the sensitivity of third countries and developing countries, and also some EU countries, to 'climate justice'; the fact that the two greatest superpowers, the USA and China, are competing with each other both economically and militarily; and the fact that the 'ambitious' plans to limit CO2 emissions were based on the paradigm of anthropogenic climate warming, which does not have a great deal of scientific credibility."
"The alarmist statements of the IPCC should be regarded as highly irresponsible, because political and economic decisions which are based on them will affect many future generations."
"These decisions must not, therefore, be based on the opinions of people who are putting into practice a thesis which has been established in advance - the theory that it is mankind which is causing global warming."
"The scientific credibility of the IPCC is undermined by such things as the Climategate affair, the falsification of global temperature trends (Russia and Australia) and the Glaciergate affair."
"Therefore, all legal regulations which are unfavourable to development of the European economy and are based on statements of the IPCC should be reviewed immediately."
"On the matter of climate change, which is so important for the whole of civilisation, the time has come for the European Commission to base its actions on its own meta-analysis of climate research, which should be carried out by a team of climatologists which is independent of the opinions of the Commission and free from all political pressure."
"These last two stipulations are missing from the resolution, and I therefore voted against its adoption."
"I voted against the resolution because it contains too much wishful thinking."
"We saw in Copenhagen how the rest of the world regards the Union's 'leadership' where climate change is concerned."
"The so-called Copenhagen Accord was negotiated by President Obama with China, India, Brazil, South Africa and a few others, the Barrosos, Sarkozys and Co. not even having been invited."
"Instead of imposing new burdens on our economies and our citizens, let us invest in the technologies of the future."
"Last year, China became the world's leading exporter of wind turbine equipment and photovoltaic cells."
"Europe must join in this technological battle instead of inflicting on itself a sort of collective punishment, which does not impress anyone outside Europe and which will not attract any followers."
"My vote on this resolution expressed my disappointment with the agreement finally reached in Copenhagen at the end of 2009, an agreement which I consider to be inadequate, unambitious and lacking in any quantified commitment."
"I also regret that the amendment tabled by my group to create a tax of 0.01% per annum on financial transactions in order to finance efforts to combat climate change in the poorest and most directly affected countries to the tune of EUR 20 billion per annum was not adopted."
"Finally, if the EU is to have any weight in international negotiations such as these, it needs to learn to speak with one voice, so as not to miss opportunities to play a key role in global climate change."
"This is done by setting ambitious objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 20% by 2020."
"in writing. - The Copenhagen Summit was very much a missed opportunity in efforts to tackle climate change."
"My own country, Scotland, has adopted the most ambitious climate change legislation in the world whilst the Scottish Government's recent collaboration with the government of the Maldives serves as a model for international agreement."
"Today's resolution calls for 'bilateral meetings between the European Parliament and the national parliaments' in order to facilitate understanding;"
"I expect the national parliament of Scotland to be included in any such meetings given its world-leading stance."
"This resolution includes some not insignificant advances on the part of the groups on the right that signed it: mention of the IPCC's work, which refers to climate change, a call for greater involvement by civil society in the work of the Mexico conference, a call to the EU to push its targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond the 20% proposed for 2020."
"They are not enough, however, and the praise for the carbon market means that they lose all plausibility."
"The aid offered to the countries of the South, to which we owe a climate debt, is not enough."
"Similarly, the proposed aim of moving towards a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 is a long way from the 40% recommended by the IPCC."
"Moreover, no reference is made to the initiative of the Bolivian President Evo Morales Ayma's People's World Conference on Climate Change."
"To date, however, it alone proposes to the peoples of the world that they recognise their rights to the ecosystem and establish a court of climate justice."
"in writing. - (PT) The great hopes surrounding the much-vaunted Copenhagen Summit have been dashed."
"The countries with the greatest responsibility in this matter did not reach a consensus on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."
"This problem, which is a matter of concern all over the world, needs a fast solution."
"There needs to be more transparency and a greater input from civil society at the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP 16) in Mexico."
"The EU must be capable of taking a leading role in the fight against climate change."
"All countries, from the USA to the so-called emerging countries, including China, which are heavy polluters, must also accept their responsibilities in a fight that is leaving less and less room for new opportunities."
"The sustainable future of humanity is at issue here."
"If nothing is done in time, we could reach the point of no return."
"I have abstained in the vote on Resolution concerning the results of the Copenhagen Summit on climate change because I believe it was a failure, given that the Copenhagen Accord is not legally binding and does not establish global emissions reduction targets."
"At the summit, developed countries did not recognise the climate debt they owe to developing countries, nor did they show regret for the harmful consequences of the market mechanisms in place (carbon trading)."
"By abstaining, I wish to express my deepest disappointment with the result of the summit, which was well below our citizens' expectations."
"The European Union must, for once and for all, take responsibility and do everything possible so that CO2 emissions are reduced by 40% by 2020."
"I therefore believe we need to propose a new economic and social model to challenge capitalism."
"I welcome the decision made by the President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, to hold the Peoples' World Conference on Climate Change and Mother Earth's Rights."
"The Copenhagen climate summit was rightly considered by most observers to be a failure."
"It is difficult to resist the impression that in Copenhagen, world leaders were playing a risky game, and were not trying to work out the best agreement, but to blame the other side for the lack of an agreement."
"It is worrying that the EU, despite having worked out a common position, was not able to use it as a platform for an agreement with other countries."
"The European Union must begin efforts to ensure that the COP 16 conference in Mexico will end with success."
"The climate agreement which the EU should promote must have three basic features: it should be legally binding, should show solidarity and should be ambitious."
"The decision made during the EU summit in Seville, according to which the EU will not limit its emissions in 2020 by more than 20% in comparison with 1990, should be viewed with alarm."
"The condition for increasing the reduction goal to 30%, which is that other countries must first make such a declaration, has been repeated."
"At the moment, however, the international situation looks as if only the EU can provide the impetus for more significant reductions."
"No one will take the EU's place, here, and the EU must not give up the role of global promoter of radical means in the fight against global warming."
"The EU must make EUR 7.2 billion available and undertake to use it for countries which are the most underdeveloped and most under threat from climate change."
"To draw lessons from the failure of the Copenhagen Summit: that is the priority of the European Parliament with this resolution that I have voted for."
"We know what is wrong: the UN method no longer works, the United States and China have behaved like adversaries in the fight against climate deregulation and the European Union has been unable to speak with one voice."
"While we know what is wrong, we still need to come up with the remedies so that we may reach an agreement in CancÃºn in November 2010."
"In order to retain its leadership, Europe will have to demonstrate an innovative approach to the climate issue and offer something other than the sole target of a global reduction in emissions via the highly speculative system of a market for greenhouse gas emissions, a tool that the US Government has, moreover, just rejected."
"It is time to change to a different method and to propose a 'technological' bridge between industrialised countries and regions and micro-States chiefly exposed to climate change."
"It is the addition of ambitious measures relating to clean technologies, to energy efficiency in buildings and transport systems, and to the promotion of green jobs that will give rise to the hopes of tomorrow, hopes of an agreement at the forthcoming CancÃºn Summit, greater hopes of a common world vision."
"The Copenhagen conference on climate change did not produce a solution and did not manage to agree any final resolutions or decisions concerning the scope and scale of restrictions on emissions or the financial means which will be used for this purpose."
"However, I do not think it was a defeat, although it certainly did not meet the EU's expectations."
"Those expectations were irrational, both in terms of the sizes of proposed greenhouse gas reductions and in terms of the financial expectations related to combating climate change."
"On top of this, there was also a little arrogance in claiming a leading role in the process of the fight against climate change."
"In my opinion, we are still at a stage when making binding and final decisions is inadvisable."
"This is because, among other reasons, we still do not have reliable scientific data on climate change and the role of mankind in the process."
"Recently, we have been witnesses of disputes among experts and scientists on the subject, which confirms that they do not all have the same views on the effects of global warming."
"An additional argument in favour of deferring a final decision is the economic crisis, which is forcing countries to make savings and cut expenditure."
"In the difficult times of an economic recession, priority treatment is demanded by social matters such as the fight against unemployment and the impoverishment of society, support for entrepreneurship and other measures to accelerate economic growth."
"in writing. - Clearly, while the summit in Copenhagen was seen as disappointing in its final outcomes, there is much to commend further efforts."
"There is simply no alternative to collective action on this issue."
"As the European Union will continue to play a pivotal role along the road towards the next conference in Mexico, every effort has to be ensured to gain political acceptance at a global level."
"It is on the issues outlined by many scientists and other observers that citizens are making up their minds to support climate change proposals."
"Those who merely rely on creating an atmosphere of fear and hostility do little to elaborate the arguments in their favour."
"The line adopted by EU governments, led by Minister Ed Miliband, have won support and offer real hope of a deal."
"This Parliament must continue to support this approach."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as it calls for a firmer line to be taken in the negotiations about a global climate policy."
"Furthermore, the lack of an international agreement is no reason to postpone further EU policy measures to implement previous EU pledges to cut our emissions by 20% by 2020."
"Parliament reiterates its aim of increasing this reduction to 30%."
"It is good that this House is expressly stating that the initiatives taken in order to promote and incentivise the green economy, energy security and the limiting of energy dependence will make it easier and easier to obtain an undertaking to achieve a reduction of 30%."
"It is important that lessons should be drawn from the failure in Copenhagen."
"Thus, we need to face the important self-criticism that the EU was unable to build confidence, during the negotiations, through specific prior pledges of international government financing for climate measures in developing countries."
"Thus, also, it is important to recognise that the EU's collective contribution to the efforts to achieve a reduction and to fund the adaptation needs of the developing countries for 2020 cannot be below an amount of EUR 30 billion per annum."
"I hope that Mexico will have a successful outcome."
"I have voted against the resolution."
"Unfortunately, a number of good amendments were rejected."
"People's sense of reality with regard to climate protection seems to have gone out of the window."
"Critical comments and correct scientific work on climate protection have been rejected, while approval has been given to Europe going it alone."
"This is not what I understand to be a responsible policy for our citizens."
"I abstained on the European Parliament's resolution on the Copenhagen Summit because it does not prove a match for the failure of that summit, even if the European Parliament has clearly condemned the European Union's shortcomings on that occasion."
"Admittedly, some positive measures have been adopted, such as those calling on the Commission to be more ambitious with regard to greenhouse gas emissions and to grant adequate funding to eliminate these gases."
"Other amendments are unacceptable, as they leave it up to the market to regulate by means of emission permits, clean development mechanisms, and so on. Furthermore, a request is made for the European Union to enter into negotiations with the United States with the aim of creating a transatlantic carbon market."
"Finally, I regret the rejection of the call for the creation of a green Tobin tax, the income from which would have helped developing countries to combat climate change."
"No lasting, serious or coherent solution to climate change can be found in the rationale behind the system that created it."
"The European Union is duty bound to move forward and to set an example, no matter what the attitude of the other states."
"It can do so if it is able to provide itself with the necessary resources."
"The Copenhagen conference was a failure."
"However, this agreement incarnates a first step which brings most of the parties together and provides a basis for commitments to reducing, financing, measuring, notifying and verifying actions to mitigate climate change and combating deforestation."
"In supporting the resolution, I expressed my wish for 'climate diplomacy' to be established at international level, with the primary objective of protecting Creation."
"Parliament has also announced that the collective contribution by the Union towards efforts to reduce climate change and to help developing countries adapt should be no less than EUR 30 000 million per annum between now and 2020, knowing that this figure may increase as new knowledge comes to light on the seriousness of climate change and the costs involved."
"Apart from any environmental romanticism, we must not forget European industry."
"That is why I consider it essential to the competitiveness of European industry for similar efforts to be made by other industrialised nations outside the EU and for developing countries and emerging economies to commit to reasonable reductions."
"Reduction targets must be measurable, significant and verifiable for everyone if there is to be climate justice."
"I voted in favour of the motions for a resolution on the outcome of the Copenhagen conference on climate change, albeit with some confusion."
"In Copenhagen, where I was present as a delegate of the European Parliament, a non-legally binding accord was reached."
"Not only does this accord fail to offer a suitable response in the international struggle against climate change, but it also fails to resolve the problem of the distorted conditions of international competition."
"These work to the detriment of European companies which, unlike their main competitors from other countries, such as the United States and China, must already comply with ambitious emission-reduction goals."
"I believe that the European Union must work to define an effective strategy with a view to the upcoming international meetings; a strategy that aims to promote green technologies, energy efficiency and renewable sources; a strategy that introduces a truly effective global system of combating climate change - and one that gives no succour to distortions in international competition."
"in writing. - I abstained on the vote on the Domenici report despite the vast majority of sensible proposals contained in it."
"There is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues it raises."
"It is, on the one hand, necessary to ensure that different corporate tax regimes do not enable companies to evade their responsibilities to support society by a share of their profits through a fair corporate tax regime."
"However, particular attention needs to be given to the negative impact that a CCCTB could have on small countries such as Ireland, whose prosperity and employment levels depend to a large extent on its capacity to attract foreign investment."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this Report on Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters, which is key to rebuilding the global economy."
"It requires transparency, exchange of information, cross-border cooperation and fair tax competition."
"It would discourage tax fraud and evasion to the competitive advantage of tax compliant businesses and reduce pressure on governments to lower corporate tax rates which shifts the tax burden onto workers and low-income households while forcing cutbacks in public services Any European agreement on Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base has to have regard to the needs of geographically marginal regions of the EU such as Ireland and their capacity to attract FDI."
"A CCCTB is not about a common tax rate."
"Taxation of companies is the exclusive responsibility of each Member State."
"The idea of CCCTB is to establish a common legal basis for the computation of profits of companies with establishments in at least two Member States."
"On CCCTB, this report says; 'Recalls that the introduction of a CCCTB would help to tackle - within the EU - double taxation and transfer price issues within consolidated groups' I welcome the Irish Government's proposal in this year's Irish Finance Bill to regulate transfer pricing by transnational corporations."
"in writing. - (PT) We welcome the explicit statement in the report that it: 'Strongly condemns the role played by tax havens in encouraging and profiteering from tax avoidance, tax evasion and capital flight; urges the Member States, therefore, to make the fight against the tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight a priority'."
"We also support the statement that with 'the efforts made as part of OECD-led initiatives' the 'results remain insufficient to cope with the challenges presented by tax havens and offshore centres and must be followed by decisive, effective and consistent action' and even that 'the commitments made by the G20 to date are not sufficient to address the challenges posed by tax evasion, tax havens and off-shore centres'."
"The most important thing, however, was not to reduce this to mere good intentions, but rather to combat and eliminate tax havens and offshore centres effectively, especially when, as in certain cases, there is a certain amount of drama surrounding the public deficit, aimed at pursuing and even enhancing the same neoliberal policies that once again leave the workers and the people with the bill for the crisis."
"For you, good governance in tax matters is not about the fight against fraud, bearable taxation or good use of public funds."
"It is about the systematic hounding of the taxpayer, mainly the European taxpayer, and the automatic exchange of information on his bank accounts without him having committed any offence."
"What is more, I am not talking here about big companies or very wealthy individuals, who will always have the means to slip through the net, but about the average European."
"Your speech on tax havens is hypocritical: you rail against Liechtenstein and the Caribbean, but you do not say a word about Europe's biggest tax haven, the City, or about those in the United States."
"Nor do you say a word about that which enables those havens to exist: the tax hells that now characterise the majority of the European Member States, which are crippled by debt and deficits."
"Because public expenditure has exploded in order to bear the social consequences of your economic policies and the exorbitant costs of mass immigration."
"Because the Member States can no longer fund their debt unless they resort to the markets and abide by their conditions, which means that, today, 15 to 20% of the budgetary expenditure of a State such as France covers only its interest payments."
"We will not be used as a moral alibi for such a policy."
"in writing. - Using CCCTB to combat double taxation is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut."
"There are much more efficient ways of combating the issue of double taxation."
"That is why I voted against recital 25."
"in writing. - The current economic crisis has highlighted a number of vital areas in which reform must be made within Europe and across the wider world."
"Good governance in tax matters is very much an important element in a healthy economy and the EU has a key role to play in promoting international good governance in these matters."
"in writing. - Tax fraud and tax evasion result in an estimated EUR 200 billion being lost each year - money stolen from taxpayers in the rich world and the neediest in the developing world."
"This scourge must be tackled, and my delegation supports this report which sends a strong message that the European Parliament will not tolerate fraud, evasion or tax havens operating with impunity."
"In particular, I welcome the clear statement that we must aim for automatic exchange of information to become the general rule."
"Studies show this is the most effective way to tackle tax evasion and protect revenues."
"Those who oppose these calls are acting in the interests of a tiny elite of wealthy individuals and corporations who make use of tax havens, and against the many who pay tax and rely on the services it pays for."
"The report refers to the forthcoming impact assessment on the proposed Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base."
"While we have no objections to further analysis, my delegation would require strong supporting evidence before being able to consider backing such a proposal."
"The report also asks for an analysis of possible options for sanctions against tax havens, which we support without prejudice to a final position."
"in writing. - (PT) Good tax governance is essential to provide guarantees in extremely important areas such as the principles of transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition."
"The financial crisis has exerted ever more pressure on everything relating to combating tax evasion and fraud, along with the fight against tax havens."
"At a time when millions of people all over the world are suffering from the effects of the crisis, it would be pointless to fight those who do not meet their responsibilities."
"This initiative marks an important signal from the EU to third countries, sending out the message that it is effectively combating everything about tax havens."
"Fighting tax havens all over the world is not solely a matter of justice in tax but, above all, one of social justice."
"We must implement a policy of good governance, both within and outside the European Union, not least to oppose unfair tax competition, particularly with those countries that represent tax havens."
"Transparency and the physical exchange of information are the foundations of fair competition and of a fair distribution of the tax burden."
"Moreover, good tax governance is an important pre-condition for preserving the integrity of financial markets."
"The motions on administrative cooperation and on mutual assistance for recovery, which we are adopting in this plenary session, are taking us in this direction."
"At the international level, one of the instruments that the EU can use to promote good governance in tax matters in third countries is to negotiate tax fraud agreements with them, which include a clause on an exchange of information."
"The statements of the five countries with which the EU has a savings agreement (Monaco, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Andorra and San Marino) are an important step towards the end of a situation of complete imbalance."
"Such statements must, however, be followed by the conclusion of legally binding agreements."
"The EU must also act as a driving force in this sector, setting a good example and following through what the G20 summit has already set in motion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the theme of good tax governance has always been very important but has become even more relevant since the great economic and financial crisis that struck our continent about two years ago."
"In recent years, the subject has been discussed during European and international summits, with particular regard to combating tax evasion and tax havens."
"There is certainly evidence of commitment and will by the Commission, but we must undoubtedly implement a serious policy to prevent tax evasion by front companies that evade tax laws with a simple click of a mouse through the Internet."
"I am sure that the principle of good governance, based on the principle of transparency and exchange of information, can constitute the basis for pursuing the European Union's priority aim of combating tax havens, tax evasion and illicit capital flight."
"The European Union must also speak with a single voice internationally, and fight for the improvement of OECD standards to achieve the automatic exchange of information, instead of exchange on request."
"And for this reason, I will vote in favour of the report."
"I have voted in favour of the report promoting good governance in tax matters, because I am of the opinion that combating tax fraud and tax evasion effectively is of the greatest importance."
"Furthermore, we must overcome the blockade on tax issues in the Council of Ministers and reinforce good governance in the area of taxation."
"I am in favour of international cooperation on tax evasion, but I doubt that administrative cooperation leading to the automatic exchange of all data concerning the assets of European citizens is the best way of achieving fair taxation."
"A deduction at source on all financial transactions would be a far more effective method."
"Such a deduction at source should be a final tax."
"It could become a European resource."
"The so-called 'good governance' recommended by the European Parliament lays bare every aspect of citizens' privacy."
"It destroys the protection of individual data which, paradoxically, the European Parliament wishes to safeguard in the SWIFT dossier."
"It is for these reasons that I have not voted in favour of these reports."
"While tax fraud must be combated, it must not make us forget that fraud alone would never have led to the economic crisis we are going through today."
"This crisis is a structural crisis of capitalism and originates in the very logic of that system, the virtues of which the European elites blindly extol."
"I am voting for this text because I condemn the pursuit of personal profit to the detriment of the common good."
"This logic is just as much a part of tax fraud as it is of European neoliberalism, which is much more responsible than fraud for the failure of the Millennium Development Goals, however timorous."
"VAT, which this text also supports, is one of the aberrations of this system."
"It is the most unjust tax in the world, as it subjects all citizens to the same rate of taxation in spite of the huge differences in income that are the mark of neoliberalism."
"It is a pity the text does not tackle the basic problem or attempt finally to put the fair distribution of the wealth produced for the common good on the European policy agenda."
"in writing. - Whilst UKIP believes in the equality of men and women, we reject any attempt by the EU to legislate in this area."
"We believe that measures at national level are more appropriate in this domain."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of Mr Tarabella's report because I believe that equality between men and women in the European Union, as recognised in the Treaty on European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, is a fundamental principle which is still not being implemented in a uniform way."
"Notwithstanding the pay gap between men and women, occupational segregation and sexist stereotypes, the report aims to emphasise the principle of the same pay for the same work, as set out in Community treaties since 1957."
"It stresses that the economic, financial and social crisis which has the European Union and the rest of the world in its grip has a real impact on women, their working conditions, their place in society and equality between women and men in the European Union."
"in writing. - I would like to explain my voting pattern in relation to the Tarabella report entitled 'Equality between women and men in the European Union - 2009'."
"There were a number of amendments which directly or indirectly made a reference to abortion."
"Malta is against abortion."
"The main political parties are in complete agreement on this issue."
"The greater part of society also concurs with this view."
"In addition, the religious and moral aspects are an important element."
"in writing. - (PT) In its report on equality between men and women in the EU in 2009, the European Commission points out that reconciling family and professional life, gender segregation by occupation and sector, differences in salary and the low female employment rate are the main differences between the sexes."
"These differences between men and women have been particularly exacerbated by the current economic, financial and social crisis."
"I voted against the report as I believe that it was distorted by bringing in issues such as access to abortion and free access to advice on abortion. These are very sensitive topics and, according to the subsidiarity principle, they are a matter for the individual Member States."
"I voted for this report, because with the complicated economic, financial and social situation, it is more important than ever to implement one of the most important fundamental principles of the European Union - equality between men and women."
"Every Member State must ensure that workers of both genders receive equal pay for work of equal value."
"In order to promote equality between men and women, we must ensure that men and women share family and household responsibilities."
"It is very important that paternity leave is enshrined in the directive sooner to create conditions for fathers to contribute to child care."
"The victims of human trafficking are mostly women."
"Therefore, I call on those Member States which have yet to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings to do so without delay."
"I voted against the resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union (2009), even though I agree with a great deal of its content, because we cannot call for equality for a certain category of people without denying it to another category of human beings."
"I refer to paragraph 38, which claims to guarantee women's rights by ensuring them easy access to abortion."
"The destruction of the smallest and most defenceless individuals in the shape of unborn children cannot be considered a way of confirming women's dignity and freedom."
"An anti-life conspiracy is at work, which uses tried and tested ways of deceiving us."
"We must reveal it for what it is."
"Putting together extremely fair requests with extremely unfair claims and twisting the meanings of words are stratagems that have proved effective during European Parliament votes, but I will have nothing to do with it."
"We cannot talk about the drama of abortion, which deserves the attention of politicians as well as moralists, without also recognising the rights of newborns or at least calling for proper education as far as respect for life is concerned and organising forms of support for difficult or unwanted pregnancies so that they can be allowed to reach their natural conclusions."
"I welcome the adoption of this report on equality between men and women in the EU."
"This report underlines the urgent need for a Community initiative to effectively combat violence against women."
"Also, the adoption of this resolution integrates two dimensions, which I consider to be fundamental."
"Firstly, the recommendation for paternity leave at European level."
"If there is to be equality in employment, there also needs to be equality in society and family life."
"This resolution highlights the Commission's responsibility to legislate in this area."
"However, the real major victory of this vote is that it reaffirms the right to abortion."
"No European text has reaffirmed this right since 2002, due to the reticence of one right-wing European party."
"Women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights."
"There is certainly much more to be done in terms of real access to information, contraception and abortion, but the Tarabella report must be used as a basic point of support for bringing European law forward in this sector."
"in writing. - I voted today in favour of this report, which is progressive in nature as it aims to promote equality between men and women including in areas of parental leave, child care, domestic violence and the pay gap."
"It also promotes a much wider awareness of sexual health matters for both women and men."
"However, this is not a legislative proposal."
"This is primarily a statement of principles which I am comfortable in supporting."
"It is consistent with the principles espoused by Labour and social democratic parties across Europe."
"It must be noted that the provision of abortion services is entirely and exclusively a matter for individual Member States."
"This report does not and cannot change that position."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted against the report on equality between men and women in the EU in 2009 as I believe that it was distorted by bringing in issues such as access to induced abortion and free access to advice on induced abortion. These are very sensitive topics and, according to the subsidiarity principle, they are a matter for the individual Member States alone."
"in writing. - I strongly support this report."
"Equality between women and men has long been a fundamental principle of the European Union."
"However, despite the progress made in this field, many inequalities between remain."
"The gap in employment rates between women and men is narrowing but women are still more likely to be in part-time jobs and/or on fixed-term contracts and, for the most part, to remain stuck in poorly paid posts."
"Four times more women than men across Europe work part-time."
"The gender pay gap - 17.4% - has barely narrowed since 2000."
"To earn the same as a man would earn on average for a calendar year, a woman on average must work until the end of the following February, a total of 418 days."
"The global economic, financial and social crisis is causing women to suffer a 'double blow'."
"The sectors where they constitute the majority of the workforce are in the public sector (e.g. education, health and social welfare) which is being specifically targeted for shedding of jobs."
"In addition, because of service cutbacks, women who availed of child care and elder-care, learning support, etc., are being forced to quit employment to assume those tasks themselves."
"The report of Marc Tarabella clearly emphasises the greatest barrier to gender equality."
"I know that some Members do not take the issue of gender inequality and related discrimination against women seriously."
"However, I am aware of these complications."
"The global economic crisis has exacerbated the situation and it looks as if women will be 'sacrificed' as a result of cost-cutting fiscal policies through reductions in maternity benefits and expenditure on social services."
"As women are traditionally more at risk of poverty and low incomes because they interrupt or end their professional careers in order to start a family, give precedence to their husbands' careers or care for children and the elderly, the rapporteur is proposing an adequate means of enhancement."
"Mr Tarabella states correctly that the principle of 'the same pay for the same work', valid in the treaties since 1957, has not been complied with and women in some Member States are still not paid the same rate for the same work as men."
"Apart from that, there are a number of EU policies aimed at assisting families with children that do not, however, mention single mothers or fathers living with children."
"The demand for paid paternity leave to be legislated at the European level is also correct."
"A fair division of the family and domestic responsibilities of women and men will help to resolve the situation."
"For the reasons mentioned I agree with the assessments of the 2009/2010 report and I have therefore voted for its adoption."
"I voted in favour of the Tarabella report on equality between men and women in the European Union in 2009 as it proposes specific and innovative measures and policies relating to gender equality."
"The drawing up of a directive on preventing and combating all forms of violence against women and the introduction of paternity leave into European legislation are some of the proposals that I believe to be essential to promoting gender equality and guaranteeing a more equal share of family responsibilities between men and women."
"in writing. - (PT) There is something not right when Parliament demands respect but cannot command it."
"Relevant and serious issues like this deserve our attention, discussion and a search for the greatest common denominator."
"I do not even think that this should be difficult to achieve."
"Nevertheless, the furtive and back-handed introduction of divisive issues under cover of these very topics is turning into a regrettable habit."
"Once again, Parliament has acted as a mere sounding board for the most extreme agendas."
"I cannot but emphatically reject this attempt to promote the liberalisation of abortion and the disregard for human life and dignity that come with it under the pretext of supporting equality between men and women, and the illegitimate attempt to associate both these causes and manipulate the powers of the Member States in such matters."
"This obsession with expanding the concept of sexual and reproductive health to include abortion, along with forcing it to be implemented everywhere, shows the kind of insidious methods employed by those who try to put a pretty face on reality."
"These euphemisms designed to numb the conscience cannot make it any less brutal, violence against women less cruel or this strategy less deplorable."
"in writing. - (PT) 'Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation ..."
"It knows no boundaries of geography, culture or wealth."
"As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be making any real progress towards equality, development and peace.'"
"These are the words of the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and unfortunately, they are as valid as ever."
"Gender discrimination persists in the developed world and Europe today because it is a structural problem, and one with severe consequences in terms of inequality of opportunity."
"Today, there still exist differences between men and women, in education, in language, in the allocation of domestic chores, in access to work and in carrying out professional duties."
"I believe that access and progression in work and doing a job, whether in the private sector or in public service or even in politics, should be based on the merit and qualities of the individual, irrespective of gender."
"However, I voted against the resolution due to the introduction of sensitive issues, such as access to abortion, which are a matter for the Member States alone."
"in writing. - (PT) The adoption of this resolution in Parliament was crucial, despite the conservative Right's desire to derail it, as it enshrines important rights for women."
"Despite certain weaknesses, the report succeeded in highlighting important points such as the need for paternity leave that is linked to maternity leave, the issue of sexual and reproductive rights and the need to step up the fight against inequality and discrimination in the workplace, against violence and trafficking in women and girls, and denouncing the poverty and precarious, poorly paid work to which many women are subjected."
"It was important to show approval, once again, for the idea that 'women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, through easy access to contraception and abortion'."
"This resolution has particular resonance on the eve of the centennial celebrations of International Women's Day and 15 years of the Beijing Platform."
"Let us hope that it will come to be implemented in reality."
"Yes, women encounter specific difficulties."
"However, as usual in this House, the initial intention was good, but it has led to a distorted analysis and wild proposals."
"This report portrays a caricature of a European society marked by daily and systematic hostility towards women: recovery policies are apparently sexist because they tend to aid male labour sectors, as are strict budget policies, because they affect feminised public sectors ..."
"By contrast, there is absolute silence on the consequences of the massive presence in Europe of immigrant populations whose culture and practices imprison women in an inferior status, light years away from our values and our concepts."
"There is also silence on the negative consequences of your talk of total egalitarianism: women are gradually losing specific and legitimate social rights acquired in recognition of their role as mothers."
"Finally, there is also silence on parental salaries, which are the only way of giving women a choice between a professional and family life or of reconciling the two."
"Finally, when I see many of our fellow Members getting carried away by hysteria and imposing across-the-board massive and obligatory abortion, which has been hoisted to the rank of a fundamental value for a Europe en route to collective suicide, I begin, despite myself, to regret that their mothers were not aborted."
"While I strongly oppose all of the EU's negative measures - and there are many of them - I support them when things go the right way."
"Thus, in this report, strong calls are made (especially to the European Commission) concerning the unequal treatment suffered by women, the introduction of paternity leave, the creation of a year for combating violence against women and the right to easy access to contraception and abortion."
"The report also emphasises that women must have access free of charge to consultation on abortion."
"The reason for my positive vote, therefore, is the improvement achieved, but it is an improvement that needs to be more evident in practice."
"All the more so since I can only regret the refusal of a majority in Parliament to support the creation of a European charter of women's rights, a European inter-gender violence monitoring centre and an 'International Equal Pay Day'."
"Similarly, this Parliament has made no attempt to tackle the deep causes of these inequalities, which lie in the economic system of market rule alone, which Europe applies every day."
"in writing. - Whilst gender equality is a fundamental right within the EU recognised in the Treaty on European Union, there remain unacceptable levels of inequality in a wide number of areas."
"It is clear that huge problems remain and so it is imperative that the EU institutions work to positively identify and seek solutions to these issues wherever they exist in the Union."
"Today, 10 February 2010, the Swedish Conservatives voted against the report on equality between women and men - 2009."
"Although we share the rapporteur's desire to improve equality between women and men in Europe, we do not feel that interference with the sovereignty of the Member States through demands for so-called gender budgeting, by urging the Member States not to cut social benefits and by imposing quotas through legislation is the right way to go."
"Equality must be achieved at individual level, by expanding opportunities to influence one's own situation - not through legislation at European level and gesture politics such as specially designated days, further EU authorities and an EU charter on women's rights."
"There is already an EU charter on civil liberties and human rights that has been strengthened by the Treaty of Lisbon, and which covers women too."
"We must stand up for the principle of subsidiarity."
"In the final vote, therefore, we voted against the report, even though there are naturally points with which we sympathise; we fully support the statement that women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, for example."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of recital X and most parts of paragraph 38, abstaining on one part of paragraph 38, for the following reasons:"
"As a main principle, women's sexual and reproductive rights should be respected, particularly in the context of equality between men and women, which is guaranteed by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Art. 23)."
"However, I believe women should learn to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancies; in other words, when there is easy access to contraception and specialised advice, then abortion is more difficult to justify."
"Many in my electorate in Romania would be disappointed if I voted differently."
"In addition, the past is still alive in our minds - as highlighted in the 2006 report commissioned by the President of Romania - when the Communist party took draconian measures against abortion in order to ensure the control of the party over women's private lives."
"Many women died as a result of illegal abortions, performed without medical help."
"I fully support the driving spirit behind the resolution which has the merit of being based on the assumption that the debate on demographic changes is connected with the debate on measures necessary to combat the impact of the economic and financial crisis on the labour market."
"Considering that our analysis of progress in achieving the Lisbon objectives is not encouraging, we welcome the call expressed in the resolution to speed up legislative changes in Member States, to tighten up infringement procedures and encourage greater participation of women in key sectors of the labour market that reflects the goals they have achieved as far as training is concerned."
"Having said this, I am bound to voice my absolute disapproval, already expressed at the voting stage, of this pernicious will to promote an abortion society by providing incentives for free access to termination of pregnancy."
"The assumption that women must be able to achieve easier abortions in order to recover their right to sexual freedom not only runs counter to general lay morals, but also contradicts the principles enshrined in recital Z, which states that the promotion of 'higher birth rates to meet future requirements' is central to the European action."
"I remain firm in my commitment to promoting a responsible sexual culture."
"Women are the main victims of the economic and social crisis that the European Union's neoliberal policies have created."
"Thanks to the crisis, the number of insecure jobs and compulsory part-time positions are increasing."
"The patriarchy still completely pervades our societies."
"They are now scarred by the forceful return of stigmatisation on religious grounds, and women are forever the main victims of these changes."
"It is therefore gratifying to see the European Parliament place such a crucial matter as equality between women and men on the agenda."
"It is a shame, however, that the text does not focus on the intrinsically unequal nature of neoliberalism."
"It is neoliberalism that is responsible for many of the problems suffered by women and, in the deepening of the inequalities between the sexes, it finds yet another way to flourish."
"in writing. - (PT) Inequalities between men and women on various levels, whether by profession, sector or different stereotypes, have become blurred over the years."
"Equality between men and women in the EU is increasingly a reality, and although there are still cases of discrimination, we are beginning to see very positive developments."
"Although there have been many improvements in the area of equal opportunities for women, there is still much to be done."
"One of the most urgent issues is to provide greater support for reconciling professional and family life, which, for many women and, in particular, single mothers, is an insurmountable obstacle."
"The fact that men are still more likely to be entrusted with positions of responsibility proves that equality at work can only be achieved by a change in attitudes and not by imposing quotas, particularly because quotas are controversial and can easily lead to conflict."
"As this report fails to deal with the criticism that gender mainstreaming can also swing in the other direction, I have voted against it."
"The resolution on equality between women and men in the European Union seems completely balanced to me, and I welcome the work carried out by Mr Tarabella to achieve this outcome."
"Flagrant inequalities between men and women still exist today in the employment sector, particularly when it comes to differences in pay or even reconciling work and family life."
"There are still efforts to be made in this area."
"Moreover, with regard to the protection of sexual and reproductive rights, it is essential that women have access to contraception and abortion."
"Women must be able to have full physical autonomy."
"That is why I voted in favour of the measures relating to the protection of these rights."
"Finally, I voted against the proposal to create a European charter of women's rights because, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which includes women's rights, forms an integral part of the treaties."
"This charter is legally binding and enables women to be protected in the same way as men."
"A decree was passed in Romania in 1967 banning abortions, which meant that women lost the right to choose between continuing with a pregnancy and terminating it."
"This ban had a deeply traumatic impact on Romanian society, making us realise how dangerous such a decision is."
"Women should have control over their sexual and reproductive rights."
"For this reason, I voted for all the aspects relating to easy access to contraception and abortion covered in the Tarabella report and, ultimately, for the report as a whole."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the complexity of the report under examination today was already apparent during work in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, where a risible majority of three votes and a wholesale absence of MEPs allowed the text to be adopted."
"I believe that there has been effective legislation on the protection of women since 1975."
"Instead of striving to come up with new directives, I therefore believe we should be ensuring that the existing laws are applied in full by the governments."
"It is for this reason that, even though I have no wish to vote against the report, which certainly has some positive aspects, I prefer to disassociate myself from other aspects to emphasise my disapproval of certain parts, particularly those concerning abortion over which we Catholics are naturally indisposed to compromise."
"Although I am not against abortion, I did vote against paragraph 38 because it may be interpreted as encouraging this practice."
"I am also in favour of making contraception and education on these matters more easily accessible because this is the best way to avoid unwanted pregnancies."
"On the other hand, I believe that there are communities which, for a variety of reasons, want to retain power over the control of abortion at a national level, and they should be allowed to do so."
"This is an area where the principle of subsidiarity should be applied."
"I do not think that discussing this issue in the report on equality between men and women in the European Union is the best solution."
"I have voted in favour of the report on equality between men and women in the European Union because it is in line with my fundamental conviction that women have the unrestricted right to autonomy, in particular, with regard to their sexual and reproductive rights, together with easy access to contraception and abortion."
"These rights are an essential part of the concept and self-image of a modern European society."
"in writing. - (SV) At yesterday's vote, I voted against the report on equality between women and men."
"This was mainly because, in my view, many points in the report run counter to the principle of subsidiarity, such as on the matter of quotas."
"I abstained from voting on Recital X and paragraph 38, which concern women's access to abortion."
"In my opinion, the current wording would infringe the principle of subsidiarity."
"I consider it to be a general principle that we at EU level should not spend our time on matters that the individual Member States themselves have the right to decide on at national level."
"Naturally, I support the Swedish position on the issue - namely that the decision on abortion is ultimately a decision for the woman concerned, not a matter for the legislators."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Union is currently undergoing a period of massive economic, financial and social crisis which is having a severe impact on the professional and private lives of women."
"Gender segregation by occupation, the pay gap, and difficulties in reconciling professional and personal lives are obstacles to women's full participation in the labour market."
"Despite improvements in the workplace and growing numbers of women in positions of responsibility, there still needs to be greater awareness of equal treatment."
"We should welcome this report as it gives us the opportunity to redefine guidelines on eliminating disparities between men and women in the labour market."
"Only then can the EU achieve its goals of growth, employment and social cohesion."
"The inclusion of provisions relating to 'sexual and reproductive rights' is, however, unfortunate in a report which appears within a context of economic crisis and which concerns itself mainly with the impact of this crisis on working conditions for women and the place of women in society."
"For the aforementioned reasons, and since the proposed amendments to paragraph 38, which I supported and considered essential to the economy of the document, were not approved, I voted against the report on equality between men and women in the European Union."
"I have voted against the report because my fundamental convictions do not allow me to accept the unrestricted right to abortion and to reproductive freedom."
"For me, the right to life is a fundamental right which must be defended and respected in every case."
"The other parts of the report are perfectly acceptable and demonstrate that Europe has made progress towards equality for women."
"Another positive feature is the fact that much greater importance is given to the commitment to the family."
"in writing. - The ECR Group are the strongest supporters of equality between men and women and especially the principle of equal pay and equal opportunity in the workplace."
"The ECR have decided to vote in favour of the paragraphs which support equality in this way."
"The ECR Group have nevertheless voted against this resolution for two specific reasons."
"Firstly, we oppose any legislation that assumes that women's health, education and reproductive rights are the responsibility not of Member States but of the EU. Secondly, whilst the ECR Group fully supports the need for maternity and paternity provisions, we have chosen to abstain from such references in this report because we oppose any family policy being dictated at EU level; this is a matter for national governments to decide upon."
"I voted against this resolution."
"It divides rather than unites men and women."
"There is nothing innocent about the wording of paragraph 36: 'women must have control over their sexual and reproductive rights, notably through easy access to contraception and abortion'."
"The rapporteur also insists on women having access free of charge to consultation on abortion."
"However, abortion comes solely within the competence of the Member States."
"As this resolution has no binding legal force, it cannot be used to exert pressure to liberalise abortion."
"Then Parliament calls for sexist stereotyping, especially work carried out by men and women within the family, to be combated."
"The resolution emphasises the importance of pre-school child care provision, child-minding services and the provision of assistance to elderly persons and other dependents."
"Thus, Parliament is aiming to destroy the natural family as a place of socialisation and solidarity between generations."
"This resolution does not offer any added value to women or to men or to the Union."
"It is a pity, because respect for people who are different and the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women are a real social challenge."
"I voted against the resolution."
"The rapporteur, Mr Tarabella, has not taken account of the national context."
"Morality is part of the worldview incorporated into the legal system of a country."
"The attempt to introduce into Polish legislation the possibility of unrestricted access to abortion is something which is not natural, and it is obvious that this will provoke opposition."
"Acting in accordance with my own conscience, and taking into account the legal regulations which are in force in Poland, I voted against the resolution."
"In doing so, I have given a clear signal that, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the only legislators on such sensitive matters are each of the 27 Member States."
"in writing. - (PT) Overall, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the EU's strategic objectives for the 15th Conference of the Parties in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)."
"I also endorsed the amendments to include northern bluefin tuna in Appendix II of the CITES, in accordance with the recent recommendations by the Ad Hoc Committee of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the UN, which supported the announcement of the inclusion of northern bluefin tuna in Appendix II of the CITES."
"Following this, the General Assembly of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) set a considerable reduction in the fishing of bluefin tuna by 13 500 tonnes and the European Commission restated its concern at the reduction in tuna stocks and committed itself to carrying out more reliable scientific studies."
"I realise that the loss of biodiversity is a serious problem the world over, and I believe that other animals should be the focus of other preservation proposals."
"I see this conference as crucial to the survival and sustainability of many species."
"Ultimately, I believe that a total ban on international trade in tuna - its inclusion in Appendix I - would be premature, as it would spark a crisis in the sector without being based on any concrete facts."
"in writing. - Regarding the resolution on the key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), I voted against the abolition of fishing of northern bluefin tuna."
"The reason is that this will affect the livelihood of Maltese fishermen in a very negative way."
"The vast majority of Malta's fishermen are not in a position to fish for alternative species and in alternative fishing grounds because of the traditional way in which fishing is conducted."
"Also, it is my belief that the criteria for the CITES listing are not met in the case of northern bluefin tuna."
"I voted in favour of the CITES Convention report."
"Animal and plant species are becoming extinct at a rate of one thousand times faster than the natural rate."
"Human activities are adding to this rate of extinction and are endangering biodiversity."
"CITES is a central tool in the international effort to combat the primary threats to biodiversity, to combat illegal trade, and to put in place a proper Regulation concerning the wildlife trade."
"I support those who want international law enforcement bodies to have a greater involvement in stopping wildlife crime and to address the dangers which could result from electronic commerce."
"As such, I also support the recommendation that the environmental crime unit be strengthened."
"I would like to draw attention to the effect CITES measures will have on the occupations of poor rural communities and those who are depending on trade in certain species to make a living."
"We must continue to help these countries to apply the CITES list so that we can work with those who are dependent on the wildlife in their areas."
"The European Parliament is calling for a total ban on the marketing of bluefin tuna internationally."
"As an elected representative for the SÃ¨te basin, I did not vote in favour of this measure: to date, there is no agreement on this ban, either among scientists or, I might add, among environmental associations."
"If, however, such a radical ban were to be decided on in March at the international conference in Doha, I would call on the European Commission not to block the financial compensation that the Member States might be required to pay fishermen."
"Fishermen have made considerable efforts in recent years, keeping to increasingly restrictive quotas, modernising their fleets and so on. It would be improper to force them in the future to change their profession without granting them significant financial support."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the resolution entitled 'Key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to CITES', as protection of biodiversity must be strengthened within the scope of the next Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora."
"Biological diversity is vital to the wellbeing and survival of humanity."
"We must be ambitious and demand the protection of all species that are at risk of extinction."
"in writing. - (PT) The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) constitutes the main global agreement in existence on the conservation of wild species."
"It aims to prevent the excessive exploitation of these species for international trade."
"It is therefore crucial that the European Union participates constructively in the 15th Conference of the Parties next March."
"I recognise the importance of preserving endangered species to the safeguarding of the planet's biodiversity and ecological balance, and I acknowledge that sustainable development presupposes the reasonable use of natural resources without impeding activities that are necessary for development."
"Therefore, at a time when changes to the appendices of the CITES are being discussed, I recognise the importance of also ensuring that there is sufficient protection for endangered wild species without jeopardising or consigning to oblivion any activities that ensure the economic and social viability of many communities."
"in writing. - (PT) The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has acted as an important tool for conserving endangered flora and fauna species, especially those that attract commercial interest and therefore have to be protected and enriched."
"We understand that decisions on alterations to this convention, including its appendices, are important, as they allow us to acknowledge and take due account of proven changes in the conservation status of species."
"These must have supporting data and substantiated scientific opinions."
"We do not believe that the proposal to include bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in Appendix I of the CITES is justified, in the light of the available data."
"We should recall that at the last reunion of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), in November 2009, experts expressed the view that the species was being over-fished, but that this did not point towards a total ban on fishing."
"The recommendations pointed to a significant decrease in catches, which were restricted to between 8 000 and 15 000 tonnes, with a fixed limit of 13 500 tonnes. In these circumstances, we believe that we should wait for the assessment and recommendation by experts, following the situation closely in 2010."
"I voted in favour of this resolution."
"One of its aims is the conservation of bluefin tuna, an essential component in the balance of the biological diversity of the marine environment."
"The ban on the international trade in bluefin tuna will enable us to conserve our stocks of bluefin tuna, which are threatened by overfishing."
"Nevertheless, Europe will have to check the measures taken by third countries, because how will we explain to our fishermen in Europe that Japanese, Libyan or Tunisian trawlermen are quite legally plundering our stocks of bluefin tuna?"
"We will also have to focus on negotiating the organisation of an exclusive economic area that will enable small-scale fishing to continue, since it does not threaten resources."
"I voted in favour of a ban on the trade in bluefin tuna and, as a corollary, compensation for the tuna industry, as provided for in an amendment which I co-signed and which was adopted in part."
"Thus, bluefin tuna should be listed in Appendix I to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), subject to a general derogation for domestic trade, so that small-scale coastal fisheries can continue, and stricter controls on illegal fisheries."
"We should not only address this threatened species, stocks of which have fallen by 60% over the last 10 years, but also make provision for substantial aid for fishermen and ship-owners who will be affected by this measure."
"That is indispensable."
"in writing. - I voted for listing the bluefin tuna in CITES Appendix I, as a majority of the FAO Ad Hoc Expert Advisory Panel considered that the available evidence supported the proposal to include it there."
"The species has suffered a marked decline, is greatly overfished and is threatened by over-exploitation for international trade."
"It therefore meets the criteria for listing in CITES Appendix I."
"The current situation of northern bluefin tuna is unsustainable and its survival can only be guaranteed through quota reductions;"
"I might add that those quotas have always been above the limits recommended by the scientific community."
"The inclusion of bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), and the subsequent ban on international commercial trade in this species, is the solution that best guarantees the recovery of the species."
"Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that some sectors of the fishing industry have acted responsibly, respected quotas and adapted to all the requirements that have been established in recent years."
"For that reason, I voted in favour of subjecting the inclusion of the bluefin tuna in CITES Appendix I to the following conditions, as was finally approved: amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 introducing a general derogation for domestic trade; financial support from the European Union for the vessel owners that are affected; and tightening of controls and penalties to combat illegal, unregulated fishing."
"I also voted in favour of postponing the inclusion of bluefin tuna in Appendix I by 18 months, subject to an independent scientific report."
"That proposal was not adopted."
"Today, on 10 February 2010, the European Parliament has been called on to express its views on the EU strategic objectives for the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to be held in Doha (Qatar) from 13 to 25 March 2010."
"Although Parliament's role is merely consultative, I nonetheless thought it important to sign and vote on the amendment seeking to eliminate the inclusion of red coral in Appendix II to the Convention, which would have caused a significant reduction in red coral fishing and trade, as an endangered species. The inclusion of Corallium spp in Appendix II indeed seems over-cautious and not properly corroborated by scientific data."
"Moreover, the economic and social repercussions that its inclusion could have on Italy's economy and, in particular, on some regions of southern Italy, caused me great concern and led me to vote in favour of this amendment."
"In fact, I thought it more expedient to allow our companies in that sector more time to restructure their production and thus, to remain competitive on the market."
"Bluefin tuna is threatened with extinction as a result of the failure to control the overfishing of this resource."
"The ban on marketing it now seems inevitable."
"It is aimed at protecting this species."
"Aware of the problem, many fishermen, especially French ones, have, for years, been doing all they can to make their boats comply with the regulations and to observe the fishing quotas necessary to ensure the survival of bluefin tuna."
"These fishermen, already severely affected by the crisis, will be the main victims of such a measure made necessary by illegal fishing and clandestine industrial networks."
"The effort made by these fishermen cannot fall on their shoulders alone."
"We cannot ask them to sacrifice themselves in the interests of the planet while the powers that be gathered in Copenhagen have shown that they sidestepped the issue."
"The UN principle of joint responsibility for environmental problems must therefore apply, and the fishermen's effort must be compensated by a contribution from the European Union."
"Furthermore, the creation by France of a genuine exclusive economic area in the Mediterranean would make it possible to provide a sanctuary for resources while keeping alive small-scale fishing that is respectful of ecological balances."
"The EU must be present at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with clearly defined objectives for species in danger of extinction which need to be protected."
"The CITES is crucial for the conservation of wild species, and is aimed at avoiding over-exploitation of wild species of fauna and flora for foreign trade."
"I have abstained in the vote on Resolution concerning EU strategic objectives for the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) because I believe that northern bluefin tuna should not be included in CITES Appendix 1."
"It would spell the end for traditional, sustainable fishing techniques, when it is actually the industrial purse seine fishing boats that are to blame for the exhausted stocks."
"I call for acknowledgement of the part that each fishing method has played in the alarming situation regarding bluefin tuna, with a new, fairer quota distribution and stricter measures."
"For that reason, traditional fishing methods should be encouraged; these provide thousands of people with a livelihood and are much more selective."
"We must be fair: there is a vast difference between industrial fishing and traditional fishing techniques."
"I want to stress the importance of protecting bluefin tuna, but we also need to strike a balance that guarantees the continuation of the species without punishing Mediterranean fishing methods such as the almadraba technique."
"The main consideration of this resolution on the CITES Convention focusing on species threatened with extinction is fundamental: to reach a European consensus on the ban on the international trade in bluefin tuna."
"Faced with fishermen fiercely hostile to this ban, scientific and environmental experts are sounding the alarm."
"At the current rate, and despite the drastic efforts made over recent years, bluefin tuna could purely and simply disappear within three years."
"Italy has already made a gesture by adopting a moratorium from 2010."
"France has done so too, but much more ambiguously, because it is talking about an 18-month period to 'assess the state of resources'."
"As for Spain and Malta, their display of silence is reprehensible."
"The urgency is there, however, and only radical measures can enable stocks to be replenished."
"This is also the one and only way of protecting the fishermen's livelihood in the medium and long terms."
"This resolution does not come down to banning the fishing of bluefin tuna entirely, nor to letting it disappear from our plates."
"Small-scale and sport fishing will still be permitted."
"The measure for a ban on international trade should be enough to safeguard the species, given that 80% of the bluefin tuna fished in the Mediterranean is exported directly to Japan."
"I voted 'yes', despite the fact that I believe that the original text from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety was a better one, especially in terms of making reference to the northern bluefin tuna."
"It is important, however, that the Council and Commission get the message from Parliament that we support the inclusion of the northern bluefin tuna in CITES Appendix I. I would have preferred it if the three conditions created by the plenary had not been included, but I did support the amendment that proposed support for the affected fishing communities."
"The Commission and the Member States also have our backing in their attempts to transfer the polar bear from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I."
"One very important stipulation with respect to the Commission and the Member States is that they put a stop to the moves by Tanzania and Zambia to transfer the African elephant from CITES Appendix I to Appendix II with a view to trade."
"Parliament would also like to see all proposals for African elephants to be moved to a lower appendix rejected, at least until it is possible to obtain a proper evaluation of what effect the one-off sale in November 2008 by Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe had, as there are more and more signs that the illegal and organised trade in these animals' products is increasing across Africa."
"The scientific reports concerning the current biomass of bluefin tuna are alarmist: uncontrolled industrial-scale fishing has severely eroded stocks."
"Such industrial and international fishing threatens traditional coastal fishing in the Mediterranean."
"In order to avoid an ecological disaster, made twice as bad by an economic crisis in the fishing sector, it is urgent to introduce a policy for an international ban on the industrial fishing of bluefin tuna."
"My demand is to reconcile two major issues: effective protection of bluefin tuna to enable its survival and future placing on the market, and support for European coastal fishermen whose livelihood is partly dependent on this trade."
"It is, for this reason, that I support the listing of bluefin tuna in Appendix I of the CITES to prevent it from being exploited and to prevent bluefin tuna from becoming extinct, but under the following conditions: that there be ongoing scientific assessments to find out the exact state of the biomass of this species, that economic and social support be given to the European players in the fishing sector and, above all, that a derogation be introduced in respect of the domestic trade in bluefin tuna so as to help small-scale industries and thus to prevent small-scale coastal fishing, which is a traditional activity in the Mediterranean, from being killed off."
"The Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known by its acronym CITES, is an international agreement between states."
"All the Member States are party to it."
"Its aim is to ensure that international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora does not threaten the survival of the species to which they belong."
"International trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year and to involve hundreds of millions of plant and animal specimens."
"Unfortunately, the EU is one of the main markets for the illegal trade in wild species."
"The existence of an agreement guaranteeing sustainable trade is important if these resources are to be preserved for future generations."
"Within the EU, national legislation varies from one Member State to another."
"In order to provide better protection for wild species, coordination between efforts being made by the Member States and the European institutions to ensure that EU legislation on the trade in wild species is respected should be stepped up."
"The Union shall also stand up to the other parties to CITES."
"That is why I voted in favour of this resolution."
"I voted in favour of adopting the 2009 progress report on Croatia."
"I think that it is a balanced report which describes the progress made by Croatia in meeting the criteria for joining the European Union."
"After a period of deadlock lasting more than nine months, accession negotiations resumed in October 2009."
"Croatia must continue the reform process and the adoption of European legislation in order to successfully conclude negotiations by the end of this year."
"The report also notes a number of issues affecting the process of Croatia's integration into the European Union."
"The European Parliament is encouraging the Croatian authorities to overcome these obstacles and step up their efforts to resolve all the border disputes with neighbouring countries."
"The report adopted by the European Parliament plenary includes amendments which I have tabled."
"These amendments encourage Croatia to continue its efforts to promote cultural diversity."
"My amendments also included one on supporting the development by Croatia of cross-border cooperation projects designed to establish social, economic and territorial cohesion and raise the standard of living of the people living in the border areas."
"in writing. - (NL) Has this Parliament really not learnt from its past mistakes?"
"The reports about Bulgaria and Romania, too, repeatedly stated that corruption was ubiquitous and that the strength of the police and the judiciary were totally inadequate."
"Despite this, the accession of these countries was still voted through, and we all know the consequences."
"EU membership and the associated massive streams of funding have further embedded the corruption that was already present."
"For me, Croatia can be allowed to accede, but absolutely only when it is ready and when corruption no longer has society in its grip."
"Once Croatia has acceded - and, as you have heard, I do not think this should be too soon - a stop must be put to enlargement."
"The accession of all the Western Balkan countries, as envisaged by this report, is something that I find unacceptable."
"in writing. - (PT) The implementation of democracy is a long process, and one which requires a strong commitment by the government and civil society."
"It is a rocky road and is fraught with difficulties - we Portuguese know that only too well."
"When this is combined with the breakdown of a country that, despite being federal, was fairly centralised and governed by a dictatorial regime that collapsed, leading to a horrific war which will not be easily forgotten by future generations, we can indeed be immensely glad, as I was, to vote in favour of this resolution that brings us good news of the progress made by Croatia."
"I know, however, that much remains to be done, and I realise that without a free and independent justice system, neither the rule of law nor human rights can be guaranteed, as there is no foreign investment or progress."
"This holds true for Croatia and any other potential candidate country."
"I also appreciate that the speed at which Croatia is advancing towards the EU is set by Croatia itself, as the rules for membership are transparent and well known."
"I know that Croatia can live up to its aspirations."
"We hope that negotiations can be concluded within this year."
"For our part, Croatia can count on our complete support."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the 2009 progress report on Croatia, as I believe that Zagreb will succeed in surpassing the challenges put before it and conclude negotiations for the country's accession to the European Union in 2010."
"For this, it is vital to press on with reforms in different areas of the Community acquis, as well as cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia."
"in writing. - (PT) Croatia has made remarkable progress in many different areas that qualify it to be not only a reliable partner of the European Union, but also a strong candidate for membership."
"Despite the personal tragedies and material destruction that ravaged the country during the bloody conflict that resulted from the implosion of the former Yugoslavia, the country's reconstruction efforts and its consistent forging of a path towards convergence with the EU have been remarkable."
"While there remains much to be done, particularly in sectoral areas, it is clear that Croatia has done enough to deserve a place alongside the Member States, and I hope that it can join the EU sooner rather than later."
"I am hoping that the possible entry of Croatia into the European Union will be seen in the Balkans as a sign of hope, and that the other countries in the region, particularly Serbia, will recognise the national and international advantages and benefits of opting for Europe."
"I also hope that the border issues with Slovenia are promptly resolved, as these are spoiling this process, and that this can take place with the utmost seriousness, thoroughness and good faith."
"in writing. - I would like to draw your attention to a seldom emphasised aspect of evaluating the progress of the countries in question: the situation of Roma."
"Realising the importance of establishing the legal framework for anti-discrimination, by 2004, the EU managed to enforce some real improvements through hardening the accession conditions for new Member States."
"I am happy to see that the progress reports are rather critical about the achievements of these three countries, revealing that only Croatia was able to attain some slight improvement in fostering the social inclusion of Roma."
"Candidate countries must be involved in the European-level pursuit of Roma integration before now, since accession negotiations grant an unparalleled opportunity to trigger a substantial shift in the governmental attitudes towards granting equal access to Roma in employment, education, housing and health care, promoting political participation and empowering the Romani civil movement."
"All European countries - present and future members of the European Union - must engage in a concerted effort in order to overcome the historical social exclusion of the continent's largest ethnic minority and sign up for a community action plan which provides the proper legal leverage to force the participants to comply with their own pledges."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of Amendment 6 because I agree that the government of Croatia needs to make supplementary efforts to reduce prejudice and combat discrimination on any grounds, including sexual orientation (one of the non-discrimination grounds in Art. 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights)."
"My approach on the issue of sexual orientation discrimination, as well as regarding discrimination against any minority, is consistent with EU legislation and other international human rights law and with the views of many of my electorate in Romania, as well as with my beliefs."
"It is not Croatia that I am opposing by voting against this progress report."
"The people of Croatia do not deserve to be ostracised in any way."
"However, I do condemn the Euro-liberal diktat to which both the Member States of the EU and the candidate countries are subjected."
"The economic aspect of the Copenhagen criteria, the liberalisation of the markets that it demands, jeopardises the social entitlements of the candidate countries."
"I shall support the membership of new states only when the EU makes regional integration work to the advantage of all the citizens who make it up, and not to that of the interests of the capital that dominates it today and provides it with an integration framework over which the citizens have no control."
"in writing. - (PT) Despite the nine month-long deadlock that occurred during the negotiations, due to the border dispute with Slovenia, Croatia has made significant efforts towards EU membership."
"As for the political, economic and regional cooperation criteria, it has been showing a great capacity for compliance with the required and previously stipulated conditions."
"Although we have a long way to go with this difficult drive towards enlargement, I welcome the progress made in the accession of Croatia, even as a way of pacifying the Balkan region."
"Croatia is undoubtedly the country among the accession candidates which has made the greatest progress until now."
"Therefore, the fair approach would be to step up the pace of the negotiations, so that there is the possibility of completing them this year."
"The implementation of the Community acquis is, of course, an essential requirement in this respect."
"The report supports Croatia's aims, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"Croatia has made extensive progress in many respects with regard both to its domestic and foreign policy."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution and I support Croatia's rapid accession to the EU."
"We have adopted an important resolution evaluating the state of accession negotiations with Croatia."
"It is important that the resolution shows which measures should be taken to accelerate accession talks, so that the technical details can be completed in 2010."
"The authorities in Croatia should devote more attention to providing society with better information about the benefits of EU membership."
"The functioning of Croatia within the framework of a single, common European market will bring about a development of commercial exchange, an influx of investment and general economic growth."
"The support from EU funds for modernisation of Croatia's economy, building of its infrastructure and restructuring of its agriculture is also not without significance."
"Many examples can be given, here, of the benefits received by the countries which acceded in the last two enlargements."
"The very fact of belonging to a united Europe is, certainly, not without significance."
"Negotiations in the areas of fishing, the environment and the Common Foreign and Security Policy should be unblocked as soon as possible."
"I expect the Presidency and the Commission to take specific measures in this area."
"Up till now, we have explained that further enlargement can take place only after adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The treaty is now in force, and we should accelerate talks on Croatia's membership, along with preparations for enlargement of the Union to include other Balkan states."
"This is very important for stabilisation in the region."
"I have abstained from voting on the report about Croatia, because the time pressure referred to in the report, in order to make Croatia ready for accession in the first half of 2010 is, in my opinion, not necessary."
"There is no need to hurry and there is no time pressure that justifies this process."
"The resolution on Croatia is a political resolution with no legal binding force."
"I voted in favour of it, because Croatia should become a Member State in the near future."
"Without the Balkan war, it would have joined in 2004."
"Paragraph 21 on the 'LGBT minority', which is as controversial as it is useless, was introduced in plenary."
"I voted against this paragraph."
"Croatia is party both to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to the Council of Europe European Convention on Human Rights."
"There is therefore no reason to suspect that Croatia is a nation hostile to the LGBT minority."
"Despite all symbolic pressure, Croatia retains full national competence in areas linked to non-discrimination."
"That is why I called on the Croatian family associations which I met recently during a visit to their country to continue their excellent work for the benefit of the common good of their nation and a better future for all in Europe."
"The capacity to assume obligations resulting from accession to the Union and alignment with the Community acquis should not result in the denial of the traditional national culture of future Member States."
"I voted for the 2009 progress report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because I believe that it is an important report which will have a positive influence on this country's accession process."
"The prospect of joining the European Union is the main factor guaranteeing stability and the continuation of the reform process in the Western Balkans, including the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"The report notes the progress made by this country in terms of adopting the legislation required for integration into the European Union."
"I believe that, during this next period, the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia must focus particular attention on implementing the norms which have been adopted."
"Furthermore, efforts must be made to improve interethnic relations and dialogue with neighbouring countries, as well as to bring its legislation into line on environmental protection."
"The report adopted today includes amendments tabled by me, which recommend consolidating the ability to manage the pre-accession funds supplied by the European Union and support the implementation of the reforms required as part of the accession process."
"in writing. - (SV) We Swedish Social Democrats voted against Amendment 4 as part of a greater compromise."
"For us, it was more important to demonstrate broad agreement on support for the membership of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia than to emphasise once again our position that we do not feel that disagreements between this country and its neighbours should affect the country's opportunity to join the European Union."
"in writing. - (PT) The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a good example of a mosaic of interests and ethnicities, not always peaceful or in agreement, that characterises the Balkan region."
"All the key political players agree that moving towards the European Union is the best way forward for the country, but there are many obstacles to its membership."
"Some of these are of a material nature, while others are more historical or political."
"The latter kind, one of which is the actual name of the new country, have been causing tensions with the country's neighbours, particularly Greece, so a serious and persistent collective effort is needed to overcome them."
"The stabilisation of the rule of law, regular free and fair elections and the affirmation of democracy in all its aspects, including implementing the principle of subsidiarity and decentralisation, are challenges that lie ahead for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia if it wishes to persevere with trying to become part of the European Union."
"I sincerely hope that it will."
"I believe that the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made significant progress in 2009, as is also highlighted in the resolution on the 2009 activity report."
"In voting in favour of this report, I particularly welcomed the following aspects: the visa waiver, participation in EU civil and military missions, the national authorities' accreditation for the IPA components on regional and rural development, as well as the progress made in the preparations for taking over the management of the funds supplied as part of the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA)."
"I hope that the accession negotiations will get under way in the near future and that the European Council will confirm, as part of the summit in March, that it accepts the Commission's recommendation to initiate negotiations."
"With regard to the name issue, I agree with the rapporteur's stance, namely, that Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia must step up their efforts at the highest level to find a mutually acceptable solution under the auspices of the UN."
"I also believe that the European Union must provide assistance as part of the negotiation process."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of Amendment 18 because the adoption of sexual orientation anti-discrimination provisions is a requirement for EU accession and because increased legal protection against discrimination is a message that the government sends to the whole of society about the value of all members of society."
"Sexual orientation is one of the non-discrimination grounds in Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"My approach on the issue of sexual orientation discrimination, as well as regarding the discrimination of any minority, is consistent with EU legislation and other international human rights law, with the views of many in my electorate in Romania, as well as with my beliefs."
"It is not the FYROM that I am opposing by voting against this progress report."
"The people of the FYROM do not deserve to be ostracised in any way."
"However, I do condemn the Euro-liberal diktat to which both the Member States of the EU and the candidate countries are subjected."
"The economic aspect of the Copenhagen criteria, the liberalisation of the markets that it demands, jeopardises the social entitlements of the candidate countries."
"I shall support the membership of new states only when the EU makes regional integration work to the advantage of all the citizens who make it up, and not to that of the interests of the capital that dominates it today and provides it with an integration framework over which the citizens have no control."
"in writing. - (PT) Since the last progress report, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made significant progress."
"It is important to point out that prospective EU membership was one of the driving forces behind development and reforms in countries in the Balkan region."
"The membership criteria imposed by the EU and matters relating to political, economic and regional cooperation now need to be accepted and fulfilled if the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to become a member of the EU in the near future."
"In my opinion, we must support the accession aspirations of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, because the country undoubtedly belongs to the European, Western cultural background and, in recent months and years, has made progress in numerous areas."
"The report gives a very good description of the next steps to be taken."
"Without doubt, Macedonia needs to improve its relations with its neighbours even further and, in particular, every effort must be made to resolve the name dispute with Greece."
"I have voted in favour of the report, because it provides a balanced presentation of all the factors involved."
"As a result of the obvious progress made by Macedonia, I have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"In the previous term, I worked in the Delegation for relations with Macedonia (the former Yugoslav Republic), and visited this country."
"Therefore, I am delighted with its achievements."
"2009 was a successful year for Macedonia."
"The EU introduced a visa-free regime with this state."
"This in particular fosters the development of people-to-people contacts."
"Last year, Macedonia demarcated the border with Kosovo and improved relations with Greece."
"In the resolution on Macedonia's progress in 2009 towards implementing the EU membership criteria, we drew attention to the fact that the country's government should be more sensitive to matters of ethnic minorities and strive for greater media transparency."
"We called on the EU institutions to help resolve the dispute between Skopje and Athens over the name of the Macedonian state."
"We also invited the EU Council of Ministers to accept the beginning of accession talks with Macedonia in March."
"The progress made by Macedonia in 2009 was also down to the EU's magnetic pull."
"There is no doubt that the prospect of EU membership is pushing Macedonia to change for the better."
"This country is implementing significant reforms."
"Therefore, I voted for the resolution, which praises these while also underlining a roadmap for further progress."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I support the motion for a resolution on the progress report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"I fully agree with the approach of the resolution, which agrees with the Commission recommendation and supports the opening of negotiations with the FYROM, in the conviction that this is an essential step for the development of that country and for the stability of a region crucial to the interests of the European Union."
"in writing. - I abstained in the votes on the progress reports for Croatia and Macedonia."
"I did not do so because I judged either country might be unfit to be a member of the European Union."
"It would be more accurate to say that I judged the EU to be an unfit organisation for either of them to join."
"Membership of the European Union involves serious surrender of sovereignty and an unwelcome intrusion of its laws into everyday life."
"It is increasingly destructive of freedom of speech, writing and even thought."
"Both countries gained their independence from the Yugoslavian Federation and are now preparing to surrender their sovereignty to the European Union."
"I voted in favour of adopting Turkey's progress report 2009."
"Although accession negotiations with Turkey started on 3 October 2005, they have made very little progress up until now."
"The European Parliament feels that Turkey is still not meeting the Copenhagen political criteria."
"Far-reaching constitutional reform is required to ensure greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The European Commission noted that during 2009, Turkey made some progress, albeit limited, on political reforms."
"The situation in Turkey has improved in terms of freedom of expression in minorities' languages."
"I believe that the European Union must continue dialogue with Turkey and show openness to this country."
"Turkey is extremely important to Europe, both from the perspective of economic and political ties and for the European Union's energy security."
"My country wishes to develop the partnership with Turkey as part of both the Black Sea Synergy and the European Union's neighbourhood programmes."
"in writing. - (NL) In the end, I voted against this resolution as, following its amendment in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and in plenary, we have ended up with a text that assumes Turkish membership of the European Union."
"It would have been better to emphasise that the negotiations are not open-ended, which would clear the way for more realistic alternatives such as a preferential partnership."
"After all, it is as clear as day that Turkey does not meet the conditions for accession to the EU, and that this will still be the case in 10, 15 or 20 years time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have decided to abstain from the final vote on the resolution on Turkey's progress report 2009."
"Although the text criticises the ability of this country to shoulder the responsibilities of joining the European Union, my abstention expresses an even more prudent stance."
"The current situation in Turkey with regard to democracy, the rule of law, and the protection of human rights and of minorities is still very far from European standards."
"I refer, in particular, to the Turkish electoral system that does not respect pluralism, to the law on the closure of political parties, to the interference of the military in political life, to the Kurdish issue and to the continuous restrictions on minority rights, religious freedom and press freedom."
"These are, for us, essential values and principles that represent the cornerstone of the European integration process."
"It is true that this country's admission to the European Union could bring major economic advantages, particularly to our companies, but I believe that compliance with the Copenhagen criteria is a priority condition that the Union must monitor rigorously."
"in writing. - (PT) It is perfectly understandable that the political, economic and cultural elites of Turkey aspire to EU membership."
"However, the values, traditions and rules by which we conduct ourselves are public knowledge, and we cannot change them so that simply anyone can join."
"It is up to the candidate country to accept them, and eventually, after becoming a Member, to try to live by them, but only then."
"However, during the long process of negotiations that has been ongoing with the EU, the Turkish people have felt that violations of their habits and customs - which, it should be said, are not even being observed - are being imposed, only to be denied membership in the referenda that will surely take place in the Member States, even if the politicians do end up agreeing."
"Yet Turkey is a friendly nation, with a very rich history and culture."
"It is our partner in NATO and deserves to be treated as such."
"In view of this, I would suggest that even at this late stage, there could be a referendum in Turkey where the people are asked whether they acknowledge and want to adopt our principles and values, or whether they would now prefer negotiations to begin for a new and deeper special partnership with the EU."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the 2009 progress report on Turkey, as I think it is in the interests of both the EU and Turkey to continue with the membership progress."
"I believe that the EU must meet the commitments that it has made to Turkey."
"For its part, Turkey must commit further to the reform process that is under way."
"in writing. - (PT) Turkey is still a long way from meeting the criteria it set itself at the Copenhagen Summit and seems not only less committed to them, but also less interested in fulfilling them."
"In this respect, 2009 was a difficult year, in that it became clear that there is still an enormous gap which separates Turkey from the Member States of the European Union, on issues relating to politics, law, human rights, freedom of association, expression and information, and many others."
"Regardless of how relations between the EU and Turkey will look in the future, I hope that they will converge and follow the route of dialogue and effective cooperation, and that, for its own good, Turkey continues in the direction of freedom and democracy along Western lines."
"in writing. - (PT) In addition to its economic, political and social importance, Turkey's EU membership is a challenge for both sides and has great symbolic significance as a potential bridge between East and West."
"On the world stage, the European Union is seen as a paragon of economic development, a multicultural region that encourages respect for minorities and equal rights for all human beings, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or religion."
"These are inalienable values of the project of European integration, and they represent an opportunity for the Turkish people and the peaceful enhancement of their ethnic and cultural diversity."
"Nevertheless, the process of applying for EU membership drags on without making any real progress, highlighting the long journey from the formal request for membership in 1987, which led to the opening of negotiations in 2005."
"Therefore, bearing in mind the effectiveness of this process, I believe that it is crucial to give priority to promoting a referendum in Turkey, with the aim of giving the public the opportunity to express their opinions clearly on the acceptance of full EU membership, and all the implications of this on social and cultural principles and values, or whether they would prefer a deeper partnership with the EU instead."
"It is not Turkey that I am opposing by voting against this progress report."
"The people of Turkey do not deserve to be ostracised in any way."
"However, I do condemn the Euro-liberal diktat to which both the Member States of the EU and the candidate countries are subjected."
"The economic aspect of the Copenhagen criteria, the liberalisation of the markets that it demands, jeopardises the social entitlements of the candidate countries."
"I shall support the membership of new states only when the EU makes regional integration work to the advantage of all the citizens who make it up, and not to that of the interests of the capital that dominates it today and provides it with an integration framework over which the citizens have no control."
"in writing. - (PT) I have reservations about Turkey's EU membership."
"Its continuing occupation of part of Cyprus, its refusal to open ports and airports in the region, the violation of rights of political, religious and ethnic minorities, discrimination against women, the exclusion of political parties and the revocation of laws limiting the jurisdiction of military courts are some examples that demonstrate this."
"There are other basic issues."
"Most of Turkey is not geographically part of Europe."
"Turkey has an Islamic identity that is very different from the Judaeo-Christian identity of most EU countries."
"Strategically speaking, it would be problematic for the EU to have borders with Iraqi Kurdistan."
"The secularity of the country is only held in place by military force."
"Finally, the movement of people from what would become the country with the largest population in the EU would create great imbalances in the labour market."
"None of this precludes acknowledgement of the efforts made by Turkey over recent years to meet certain criteria required by the EU, and it recognises that invaluable role that this country plays within NATO."
"Perhaps it would be far better to guarantee Turkey privileged and preferential partnership status with the EU, rather than creating false expectations and hopes for membership, something that it would be difficult for the facts and circumstances to accommodate."
"I have abstained in the vote on Resolution concerning Turkey's progress report 2009 because I believe that Turkey is playing a very negative role in negotiations between the President of the Republic of Cyprus and the representative of the Turkish-Cypriot community."
"Turkey is not complying with United Nations resolutions and it is violating international law: it is keeping 40 000 soldiers in the northern part of Cyprus, the city of Famagusta continues to be sealed off and occupied by troops, and Turkey is still sending settlers to the north of the island."
"In my view, the European Union should monitor negotiations and send an unequivocal message to Turkey: if it maintains its current position, it will never be able to join the EU, since it continues to occupy the territory of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union."
"Therefore, the full withdrawal of Turkish troops from the Republic of Cyprus and the return of the city of Famagusta are sine qua non conditions of Turkey's accession to the European Union."
"Turkey has done a great deal in its efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria."
"Very significant progress has been made in terms of complying with the standards of a market economy."
"If, however, we are talking about changes in the areas of politics, democracy or human rights, then although there has been significant progress in creating law, its implementation has not been so successful."
"This, too, needs to be understood, as it requires a change in social consciousness, which is something that happens slowly."
"However, European standards in the area of human rights, women's rights and treatment of prisoners and national and religious minorities must be met."
"Some opponents of Turkish integration are guided by reasons unconnected with the substance of the matter, and others by fears that Turkey is a big country which will have a big influence on EU decisions, because, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, the voting power of each Member State is dependent on the size of its population."
"Turkey's membership will certainly be a huge burden to the EU budget, but it should be borne in mind that it is a big market which is important for the Union."
"Turkey is a significant member of NATO and is an important partner of the USA and many EU Member States."
"It is also a territory which could provide routes for the transfer of energy sources to Europe."
"Finally, let us remember that Turkey could become a bridge for inter-religious dialogue as well as cultural and even macro-regional dialogue."
"The presence of Turkey in the Union could help stabilise this large and important region of the world."
"Turkey must understand that it cannot change its past."
"Mistakes have to be admitted."
"Then it is easier to live and establish good relations with one's neighbours."
"In contrast to the Commission and the Council, the European Parliament has been able to describe the many problems in Turkey and those relating to Turkey very clearly."
"The ban on the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP) is an attack on the infant democracy in the country and, in particular, on the Kurdish minority, which represents as much as 20% of the population."
"The fact that this is the 27th party ban within 10 years gives a clear picture of the Turkish understanding of democracy."
"The annulment of the legislation limiting the jurisdiction of military courts is yet another indication of the disunity within the country."
"As soon as the Turkish Government plans a small concession to the EU, it is exposed by the nationalist opposition."
"In almost every area, progress has come to a standstill or things are moving backwards."
"The Turkish Government is attempting to nip criticism in the bud by taking reprisals against hostile journalists and media organisations."
"Double standards are being applied to religious freedom."
"The prime minister wants to lift the ban on wearing headscarves and the age limit for Koran schools, while at the same time discriminating against religious minorities and harassing them on an ongoing basis."
"These are dreadful developments."
"Against this background, it seems only logical that the Turkish chief negotiator, Mr Bagis, does not take seriously our resolution and, therefore, our democratic decision-making structures."
"Turkey has shown very clearly that it is still generations away from joining the EU."
"The essential prerequisites for continuing negotiations with Turkey are the full implementation of the Ankara Protocol and the recognition of the EU Member State of Cyprus."
"in writing. - (PT) Turkey's EU-membership application has become a long, drawn-out process, the outcome of which still remains to be seen."
"Turkey has committed itself to introducing reforms, maintaining good relations with its neighbours and progressively aligning itself with the Community acquis."
"However, these efforts need to be stepped up in order to fully meet the criteria set at the Copenhagen Summit and in order to implement the judicial and electoral system and legislation."
"Progress towards real reforms stalled in 2009, and issues such as the non-opening of ports and airports on Cyprus are likely to affect the negotiation process."
"In the same way, the decision by the Turkish Constitutional Court to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party and the revocation of the legislation limiting the jurisdiction of military courts means a delay in the process."
"In fact, the reforms are necessary and urgent, as the resolution of Parliament ordains."
"However, in this context, where greater efforts are required to satisfy the criteria for the membership-application process, the suggestion of a referendum is pertinent."
"This referendum would ask the Turkish people whether they really acknowledge and want to adopt European principles and values, or whether they would prefer a new and deeper special partnership with the EU."

"Agreement between the EU and the USA on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the recommendation on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on the processing and transfer of Financial Messaging Data from the European Union to the United States for purposes of the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (05305/2010 - C7-0004/2010 - 2009/0190(NLE))."
"As you know, the European Parliament has been very active in this matter."
"Our Parliament is composed of Members directly elected by the citizens of Europe."
"Our main responsibility is for citizens' rights, and we must guard these rights."
"We are fully aware of this."
"This is our first and greatest responsibility."
"At the same time, we realise how important the SWIFT agreement is - for completely different reasons."
"Therefore, finding the right middle ground, here, was important."
"While this was happening, in recent months, the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force."
"In November of last year, I wrote to Mr Reinfeldt, who was President of the European Council at the time, with a request to postpone the decision and for the European Parliament's decision to be taken into account, in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"As you know, this did not happen, and on 30 November, the Council made a decision on the matter and adopted the SWIFT agreement."
"On 21 December, I sent another letter to Mr Reinfeldt."
"Parliament expressed two expectations in this letter: inclusion of our position in the negotiation mandate for a permanent agreement, and also full information for Parliament during future negotiations."
"On 21 January, I wrote a similar letter to Mr Zapatero, who currently leads the rotating Presidency, and sent the same letter again on 8 February."
"I have also written a letter, saying the same things, to Mr Barroso."
"I have also been in touch with representatives of the American Government and with Mrs Clinton."
"I have also received a letter on this matter, which sets out the position of the United States Government on the SWIFT agreement."
"Perhaps you know all this, because the documents are all available - I have sent all the documents to the political groups, so that you can use them at any time."
"This is important."
"We must have full information, so that we can make decisions on this matter in a responsible way."
"The measures we have taken will also be helped by our discussion today."
"That is why this discussion about SWIFT is so important."
"I am extremely glad that we have representatives of the Council and of the European Commission with us, who will be able to speak, and then we come to our discussion and our responsibility for a decision on this matter."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I shall start by saying that I, too, support a strong, outward-looking EU that is capable of acting shoulder to shoulder as a true counterpart to the US, and in that framework, I think it is of crucial importance to be open, fair and transparent if we are to address the issue of how Europe should cooperate with the US for counter-terrorism purposes, including law-enforcement use of data collected for commercial ends."
"Without a doubt, the targeted exchange and use of data for counter-terrorism purposes is, and will remain, necessary, but let me be clear: European citizens must be able to trust both security and data claims."
"Getting it right first time round should be the objective and, with all due respect, the Council has been insufficiently strong to do so."
"Indeed, the proposed interim agreement is a significant departure from European law in how enforcement agencies would obtain financial records of individuals, namely through court-approved warrants or subpoenas to examine specific transactions, but with the proposed interim agreement, we instead rely on broad administrative subpoenas for millions of records of European citizens."
"By the very nature of SWIFT, it is not possible to refer to the so-called 'limited' requests."
"For technical reasons, SWIFT has to transfer bulk data, thereby violating the basic principles of EU data-protection law such as necessity and proportionality."
"This cannot be rectified ex post by mechanisms of oversight and control."
"At all times, it must be clear that Parliament is not out there to just passively take note of the actions of the Council and the Commission."
"The fact is that this House is always being promised jam tomorrow if only we would be patient."
"However, we cannot keep falling for fake promises of jam tomorrow."
"We need clear commitments now and the ball was in the Council's court."
"I made that clear last week, but so far, it has failed to act accordingly."
"The Council states that it wants to ensure the utmost respect for privacy and data, but fails to address in particular the rights of access, rectification, compensation and redress outside the EU for data subjects."
"The Council states that it shares Parliament's concerns and therefore calls on the Commission to adopt draft negotiation guidelines."
"Why hide behind the Commission?"
"It is Council that will adopt the negotiation directives in the end; why have the negotiation guidelines not already been submitted?"
"Council states yet again that it wants to ensure that the TFTP will continue."
"However, it fails to address the fact that in this way, the EU continues to outsource its financial intelligence service to the US."
"The lack of reciprocity is not being addressed."
"True reciprocity would allow the EU authorities to obtain similar data stored in the US and, in the long term, consider the necessity of building up our own EU capacity."
"The Council does not show any commitment to line up with existing legislation such as the data retention directive for the telecom service providers, which does deal with specific and targeted data."
"The Council fails to clarify the precise role of the public authority."
"A 'push' system does not mean anything if, in actual practice, SWIFT has to transfer bulk data."
"Transfer and storage are, in other words, by definition disproportionate under the terms of the interim agreement and the Council does not address a European solution for the supervision of data exchange."
"President-in-Office, tell me how on earth I can tell 500 million European citizens that we are selling out on important safeguards and principles just because we are not able to put our foot down, because Council is not able to get its act together."
"Tell me;"
"I am all ears."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech with an unequivocal statement: Spain has shown clear, unreserved support for the Treaty of Lisbon, and it has done so from the very beginning."
"We did so in the certainty that the implementation of the new treaty was going to mean, inter alia, that the European institutions would be brought closer to our citizens."
"This is an objective that the Treaty of Lisbon entrusts largely to Parliament."
"Giving Parliament a bigger role and greater participation in issues such as the area of freedom, justice and security is the way in which this treaty has tried to bring the citizens and the institutions closer together."
"Let me begin, then, by assuring all the honourable Members that the Council is committed to working closely and honestly with Parliament."
"For the Spanish Presidency, this conclusion is the result of our firm commitment to the Treaty of Lisbon and its aims."
"The Council also shares Parliament's concern to ensure the security of all European citizens, for security means the guarantee that they can fully exercise their freedom."
"That is the context in which, together, we are fighting terrorism - all forms of terrorism."
"As stated in the Resolution adopted in this Chamber on 17 September, the European Parliament 'recalls its determination to fight terrorism and its firm belief in the need to strike the right balance between security measures and the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights'."
"I agree wholeheartedly with this statement."
"This is the framework within which I would like to see this debate conducted; it is a new framework under the Treaty of Lisbon, and it is based on honest, interinstitutional collaboration and a shared desire - and this is not a new desire - to fight terrorism while respecting the principles of proportionality and necessity, which are also critical if we are to fight terrorism effectively."
"Mr President, it is widely acknowledged that international terrorism has brought new challenges to our societies."
"This is a relatively new form of terrorism which has no clear organisation, is extremely deadly and operates at a global level."
"A global approach is therefore needed to eradicate it."
"It lacks a rigid, hierarchical structure and so can only be combated with an extraordinary intelligence effort."
"It is so deadly that we are having to be on maximum alert in places where large numbers of people gather."
"Prevention, coordination and intelligence are the three words that sum up our strategy for tackling this huge threat."
"All countries have endeavoured to improve internal and external coordination, to be better informed and, ultimately, to cooperate with those who are engaged in the same struggle."
"The European Union has also increased its joint investigation bodies and teams, information exchange and shared analysis."
"This is the context for the agreement we are examining today between the European Union and the United States concerning the transfer of financial messaging data."
"Data exchange without an agreement has worked uninterruptedly for many years."
"When I appeared before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs two weeks ago, several Members asked me about the outcomes of that data exchange."
"It is a pertinent issue which I think has been taken up and answered in the second report by Judge BruguiÃ¨re, which has been referred to this House and from which I shall now quote: 'during 2009, the TFTP has been a highly valuable tool used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help map out terrorist networks, to complete missing links in investigations, to confirm the identity of suspects, to locate the physical whereabouts of suspects and to identify new suspects as well as to disrupt attempted terrorist attacks'."
"I would also add that this not only applies to 2009 but earlier, in the United States, Europe and all over the world: in Barcelona in January 2008, in Germany in the summer of 2007, in London after the 7 July attacks and in the investigations into the 11 March attacks in Madrid, the Bangkok killings of April 2005 and the Bali bombings of 2002."
"These are just some of the examples Judge BruguiÃ¨re cites in his report."
"Data exchange has therefore delivered positive results."
"It has allowed us to investigate and prevent attacks."
"It has enabled us to arrest terrorists after they have committed attacks and, most importantly, before they have succeeded in committing them."
"Even though SWIFT indicated in 2007 that it had made a decision to change its databases, it did not actually do so until just a few months ago."
"This meant we had to review the protocols which, up to then, had enabled us to exchange financial data."
"That had to be done in a very short space of time."
"The mandate was approved by Council in the summer of 2009 when there was still uncertainty over the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The decision that was taken is well known."
"We signed an interim nine-month agreement which should be ratified in this Chamber: an interim agreement lasting nine months, during which this Parliament, the Council and the Commission should establish a new negotiation process to set out a definitive agreement."
"That was the decision taken."
"It may not have been the best decision."
"However, it is important to say clearly to this House that, in terms of privacy protection, the signed ad referendum agreement that we are debating here today is a great improvement on the protocols in place prior to this agreement."
"It is an improvement because this interim agreement has additional guarantees, among other elements, that were recommended by Parliament and set out by the rapporteur in the report that has been presented to us today."
"At this stage, I would like to say that the Spanish Presidency of the Council has taken full account of the resolutions adopted in Parliament and the letters sent by the President of the Parliament, as well as the report that was drawn up by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert and voted on in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 4 February."
"For this reason, the Council approved a statement that was sent to Parliament yesterday and whose key points I shall now summarise for you."
"Firstly, the Council is committed to incorporating into a definitive agreement the sound guarantees that will strengthen proper protection, the deletion of data and greater precision with regard to the exchange of data obtained by the TFTP with national authorities and third countries."
"We are also committed, of course, to strengthening the guarantees contained in the current agreement; these should remain - and be strengthened - in the definitive agreement, as should a strict limitation on the end use of data and an absolute ban on extracting data and using profiles."
"Finally, the Council, in response to the new context created by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, is committed to negotiating an interinstitutional agreement in order to enable easier access to classified documents relating to international agreements."
"In this regard, and I wish to reiterate this point as clearly as possible, the Spanish Presidency is totally committed to the Treaty of Lisbon and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, particularly Article 8, and fully recognises the legitimate concerns expressed by Parliament."
"We now know that the commitment I have just set out is possible."
"In a letter sent to the President of Parliament by the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton, and the Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, the United States Government has expressed its commitment to incorporating the requisite guarantees in accordance with the position taken by the European Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is possible that in the approval process for the agreement we are debating today, the Council could have done things better."
"What is certain, however, is that in this process, the Council has learned lessons and taken due note of Parliament's concerns."
"It is also certain that the agreement we are debating today has contributed - and I hope that it will continue to contribute - to improving the security of citizens all around the world and, of course, in Europe."
"Thank you, Mr Rubalcaba."
"I would like to remind everyone, as I said earlier, that I have received a reply from the Council to the letters which I sent."
"They are available in the political groups for you to see at any time."
"In its reply, the Council has responded to our expectations, the expectations of Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr Rubalcaba, for making this declaration and for explaining the Council's position on this."
"It is very important to us."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by thanking everyone for yesterday giving us and me your trust and confidence by voting 'yes' for the new Commission."
"It is an interesting first day at work and I am grateful to share with you the important issue of sharing information with the US for the purpose of combating terrorism, this time in relation to the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP)."
"The European Parliament has, of course, shown great interest in this matter."
"This is quite right, since the TFTP confronts us again with the challenge of reconciling data sharing with data protection and, if we take up this challenge, this helps us to give citizens security, privacy and data protection."
"One of the aims of the interim agreement has been to ensure implementation of the conditions in the European Parliament resolution of September 2009."
"We firmly intend to strengthen further the data protection part when negotiating the long-term agreement, particularly concerning the right to receive information about whether one's rights have been respected under the agreement, and stronger guarantees about effective redress, lawful data processing and the deletion of data."
"The second BruguiÃ¨re report was made available to MEPs on Monday last week, and it demonstrates the significance and the value of TFTP in the investigation and disruption of terrorism, including in the European Union."
"The report confirms that TFTP has been used to identify and arrest individuals who have subsequently been convicted of terrorism within our Member States."
"The report also highlights that TFTP is a valuable source of reliable information necessary in the fight against terrorism."
"There are specific examples and the Council referred to a few of them."
"We know that the threat of terrorism in some of our Member States remains as high as ever, and I am sure that you can see that rejection of the interim agreement by this House would represent a serious blow to EU security."
"Some of our Member States have made it very clear that they want the TFTP to continue because they have benefited from it in the past and will continue to do so."
"They have told us that the reliable information that the TFTP provides on known and suspected terrorism is an important source of legitimate intelligence needed to address the complex threat, notably from al-Qaeda inspired terrorism."
"The interim agreement is not only a favour to the US; it is in our common interest."
"Much has been said about the level of protection of data in the interim agreement and this is, of course, a key concern."
"I encourage Members - and I am sure most of you have already done so - to look closely at the interim agreement."
"You will see that it contains significant and detailed legally binding commitments on the way that the US Treasury Department can process data under the agreement."
"They include, for example, a strict limitation on the purpose of processing, which is limited to the investigation, detection and prosecution of terrorism."
"It includes an absolute prohibition on data mining - searches of the database can only be undertaken where it is possible to show a reason to believe that the subject of the search is engaged in terrorism."
"That means that the data held on the TFTP database are effectively anonymous."
"Only if there is a reason to believe that one identified person is a terrorist can the data of that person be seen and extracted from the database."
"This is important."
"The interim agreement obliges the Treasury Department to delete data within five years of receipt - a period which is in keeping with the retention period in EU legislation on terrorist financing."
"The agreement also provides for a detailed EU review in which some of our own data protection authorities will participate to ensure that these and many other data protection obligations are complied with."
"The agreement does not involve the transfer of virtually all SWIFT data to the US Treasury Department."
"I can assure you that only a fraction of SWIFT data will be transferred under the interim agreement."
"It does not in any way affect the powers of data protection authorities with regard to processing activities performed in the EU by SWIFT or financial institutions."
"Refusal of consent will bring to an end the interim agreement, including the significant data protection safeguard it contains."
"If the US is able to access data by other means - for example through bilateral relations with the Netherlands - those safeguards will no longer apply."
"If the interim agreement falls, it is likely to take considerable time before any alternative can be put in place."
"So refusal of consent risks leading to both a data protection gap and a security gap."
"Finally, the interim agreement is only an interim agreement."
"It might not be the best agreement in the world."
"It can - and it will - be improved."
"The Commission is now finalising the draft mandate and the guidelines for the long-term agreement and we will adopt them swiftly."
"I give a personal commitment to you to ensure that the European Parliament's concern will be addressed and that we shall seek a strong protection of privacy and data protection in the new agreement."
"The European Parliament will be fully informed at all stages of this procedure."
"I hope that this answers a few of your questions."
"Thank you, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, for your explanations."
"They were, truly, very important for us."
"The Council and the European Commission have just made certain declarations in relation to our expectations of the negotiation mandate and about keeping Parliament informed."
"In what we are doing, there is also another important element: the European Parliament has become jointly responsible for European legislation."
"We are also responsible for international agreements, such as the SWIFT agreement, and we are giving a strong signal that the situation has changed, now that the Treaty of Lisbon is in force."
"This is important."
"I think the recent signals from the American Government show that it has become clear that the European Parliament is, today, fully responsible for legislation."
"We wanted it to be a strong signal."
"However, we know we are responsible to our citizens."
"We are directly elected Members of the European Parliament."
"Our responsibility to defend citizens' rights is of fundamental significance and we always stress this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to welcome you on your first working day and assure you that you have the full cooperation of our group."
"At the beginning of this debate, we would like to say that we want a good partnership with the Americans, in particular, when it comes to combating terrorism."
"Secondly, we strongly support security for our citizens and also citizens' rights and data protection."
"Thirdly, we have worked very hard to ensure that the guidelines for the negotiations and our position were in place as early as mid September and we now want to see these implemented."
"Fourthly, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, I would like to say with respect that it is not that Parliament had a strong interest in this area, but rather that we regard the legislative process as our responsibility, as the President has said, and we want to be involved in this process on an equal footing with the Council and the Commission."
"Our response to the text for the negotiations is to make two very clear points."
"Firstly, we cannot accept the way in which this text has been produced."
"Secondly, although the Council maintains that 'the points from Parliament's resolution have been fully taken into account', in fact, some of the points have not been included, in particular the right to take legal action, the deletion of data and some others."
"These are the main reasons why we said in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence that this was unacceptable to us."
"It also became clear that it was only after this that things started to move."
"The US Secretary of State has not agreed to anything, unless the Council has received information which is different from the information given to Parliament."
"This has allegedly happened on some occasions."
"The Council has sent out encouraging signals this week, but has not given any guarantees."
"I would like to make that very clear."
"This is why we are saying that we want to discuss this further, that we want a good agreement and that we are very much in favour of more discussions, if there is a guarantee that this will result in a good agreement."
"Mr President, the Irish author Jonathan Swift in his famous book 'Gulliver's Travels' sent his hero Gulliver to the land of Lilliput, whose inhabitants were only six inches high."
"However, Gulliver believed that he had arrived in the land of giants."
"To me, it seems rather as if American diplomacy has followed Gulliver and believes that it can treat the European Parliament as if it were an organisation of little people."
"That is a mistake."
"Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, I would like to congratulate you on your election and your move from one bench to the other."
"However, you should be aware that it was not just an error committed by American diplomats, but also by the governments of the European Union who believed that an agreement of this kind could be pushed through Parliament and did not realise that we cannot vote in favour of such a defective agreement."
"This agreement embodies the spirit of the security ideology of the United States of America, but it does not embody the protection of fundamental rights, which we as Members of the European Parliament must guarantee for the citizens of Europe."
"The possibility of transferring large volumes of data without specifications and without specific details in individual cases is in fundamental conflict with the data protection legislation that we have adopted in Europe in all our parliaments, including the national parliaments."
"The serious problems regarding data protection have already been referred to."
"You have done so yourself."
"How long will the data be stored?"
"Who is storing it?"
"Who is passing it on to whom?"
"What options do I have for finding out about what is happening with my data, who is accessing it and whether it is correct?"
"What legal protection do I have to ensure that incorrect data cannot be gathered about me and passed to third parties, whoever they may be?"
"When will my data be deleted, if it has been collected and stored?"
"Under the terms of the Homeland Security Act, data can be stored for up to 90 years."
"If this includes a guarantee that I will reach the age of 90, then I'm happy to discuss it."
"It is worth repeating that this data can be stored for up to 90 years!"
"All of these factors represent serious failings in this agreement."
"For this reason, Mr Rubalcaba, I have to say to you that this is a bad agreement and we cannot vote in favour of it."
"If we reject it, then it is your job to negotiate a new and better agreement with the United States that respects the interests of security but, at the same time, also respects the security interests of citizens with regard to their freedom."
"If you can do this, we will support the new agreement."
"The objective of a new round of negotiations must be to find a compromise between these two things."
"I cannot recommend to the members of my group to vote in favour of this agreement at this point and in this form."
"This evening, I will suggest that my group votes against this agreement."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to welcome my former colleague and good friend, Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m."
"It is a pleasure to see you here."
"This is a first key decision for the European Parliament to take with its new Lisbon powers and expectations are high, but we need to keep a clear head."
"We owe it to our citizens to make a well-considered decision, free from outside pressures or scare tactics such as false claims of a security gap, because data, and we know this, can still be obtained by the US without disagreement."
"Let us not forget that the Member States were not unanimous on this agreement either."
"We can only give our consent to an agreement that has full democratic legitimacy, on grounds of substance and procedure."
"This is not about a battle of wills between the Council and the European Parliament nor is it about transatlantic relations."
"This is about European citizens being entitled to a proper democratic and transparent procedure."
"The answers of the Council so far are utterly inadequate, and the democratic rights of European citizens cannot be bargained away with promises of trips to the US or vague promises by the Council for future agreements."
"The Council has had countless opportunities since 2007 to handle this in a proper manner and ensure security, as well as protection of personal data and civil liberties, or ensure proper democratic scrutiny by national parliaments or, since 1 December, the European Parliament, but the Council has been incredibly stubborn."
"Parliament cannot and should not take a decision if it does not have access to all relevant information and documents."
"Our voters have a right to know that we consider all elements very seriously and that we do not simply rubber-stamp Council decisions."
"Finally, the European Parliament has been very clear for years about its concerns and expectations and, instead of coming up with more vague promises, the Council should finally provide us with the opinion of its Legal Service and the requested information demonstrating the use of the data for counter-terrorism purposes."
"I do not consider that the second BruguiÃ¨re report is sufficient."
"So, if the Council wants the consent of this House, it will have to meet our demands."
"That, Council, is the only way."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to comment on the meetings with the experts and the US ambassador."
"In the two meetings which I chaired, I did not feel in any way as if I were being regarded as a little person from Europe, quite the contrary."
"During these meetings with the experts from the US, I learnt a huge amount about the very different legal systems relating to the protection of fundamental rights in the US and in Europe."
"I am grateful to the Americans for taking part in this far-reaching dialogue."
"The nature of the task which lies ahead of us has become clear to me."
"The Council has not done this task justice in the past."
"The nature of the task facing the Europeans has also become clear to me, if we want to combine an effective fight against terrorism and effective protection of fundamental rights in the same agreement."
"I actually find it embarrassing that people have had to come across the pond to explain this controversial area to us and that the Council has not so far been able to have an honest debate of this kind with Parliament."
"The rapporteur has made it entirely clear in which areas fundamental rights, which enjoy the highest levels of protection in Europe, will be breached."
"I would like to make an additional point that I regard as a major problem from a legal and political perspective, if we look at the issue in more detail."
"The US and Europe have completely different definitions of terrorism and this is a problem which pervades this agreement."
"As has rightly been said, the Members of this House are accountable to the citizens of Europe for ensuring that their rights are preserved."
"In my opinion, we should not vote for an agreement which many of us, including Mr Weber, Mr Langen, who is not here at the moment, and Mr Schulz, have said repeatedly in public is in breach of current law."
"We must take action now."
"We have told the citizens of Europe in the course of the public discussion that we would do so."
"We must vote against the interim agreement and we must not postpone our vote."
"Parliament must not evade its responsibilities again as it did in November."
"Then we had the option of bringing everything to a stop, but the majority did not want to do so."
"Now we must take action and - I am saying this after the consultations with the Americans - this will put us in a better negotiating position and on an equal footing, which will enable us to improve security and the rights of citizens in the European Union and perhaps even in the US."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, like my colleagues here, I have been hugely frustrated and angered by the Council's treatment of and substandard consultation with this House on the agreement."
"Parliamentary consultation and consent should not be a retrospective tool."
"The reciprocity of data protection should be beyond reproach, and the manner in which the agreement has been negotiated and concluded must never be repeated."
"However, I have been reassured at least by the United States authorities and by the multi-layered data protection systems and judicial safeguards that are in place through this interim agreement."
"So our poor treatment by the Council should not compromise the EU's agreement with the United States, or any future agreements on the security of Europe. We are now receiving loads of assurances and promises from the Council and from the Commission."
"I cannot yet judge whether these answer all the reasonable requirements we have laid down, so in my opinion, we now need some time before proceeding further with our consideration of this vital measure."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the SWIFT agreement was negotiated on the basis of a dubious procedure and quickly pushed through only one day before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, in order to circumvent Parliament."
"However, I would like to focus specifically on the content of the agreement."
"We have big brother's little sister waiting for our approval."
"Mrs Clinton believes that she can persuade the Members of this Parliament to do something which we would not accept from our own governments."
"From my point of view, it is fundamentally wrong for alleged terrorism investigators to have such extensive access to databases, because this undermines people's self-determination over their own personal data."
"Personal data will be stored for decades and no one will have any control over how it is used."
"In addition, the data can still be retained after the agreement has come to an end. It will not be possible to take legal action to discover the whereabouts of the data or to claim damages for its illegal use by third countries."
"This gives the state precedence over its citizens, who will all be reduced to the status of objects of suspicion."
"The Member States are allowing other governments to spy on our citizens indirectly via the EU."
"To give some examples in Germany, should Deutsche Telekom, Deutsche Bahn or the Schlecker drug store chain still be worried about collecting information on their employees?"
"Will it now become the norm for the German Government to buy from tax investigators data that has been obtained illegally?"
"We find ourselves in a situation in which Parliament must stand up for its beliefs and make a decision."
"Why should Google be able to set data thresholds in future?"
"It is important to combat terrorism and, in particular, its causes, and I believe that we all agree on this, but not at the cost of fundamental rights."
"In this context, I have heard many speeches which refer to the EU as a community of values."
"We are just about to sweep one of these values under the carpet and my group cannot vote in favour of that."
"(MT) Let me make it clear that the European Popular Party is in favour of this agreement."
"It is all for the SWIFT agreement and tomorrow will vote in favour."
"Let me explain why: the European Popular Party is going to give its backing because its primary concern is the safety of people, the security of our citizens."
"The security of our citizens will be improved as a result of this agreement, and this is why we support it."
"This is not simply my own opinion, but it is the expert opinion of those whose specific task was to research and evaluate whether or not this agreement enhances the security of the citizens whom we all, in this Chamber, represent."
"There will be an improvement in the level of security throughout Europe and this will be extended to the security of other citizens worldwide, including the United States."
"Now I agree with those who stated that the Council did not act appropriately with the European Parliament, but I believe that the message sent out by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs last week taught the Council a lesson, a lesson that was clearly understood."
"I also sympathise with the concerns of my fellow Members on the issue of privacy, but here we must again recall that this agreement is an interim one."
"This means that a new agreement will have to be drawn up that will provide better guarantees regarding security."
"Mr President, in your introduction you mentioned responsibility."
"I appeal to my fellow Members to use the powers of this Parliament, the new powers that we have, with full responsibility, in order to truly be able to face 500 million citizens and tell them that we were defending their security."
"If possible, in order to retain more unity in this Chamber, tomorrow's vote should be postponed."
"We are ready to consider the postponement of the vote but if it is not granted, then we should vote in favour."
"Mr President, we, too, in the Socialists and Democrats, want to fight for the European citizens and we want to fight against terrorism, so that is why we will be recommending, as my leader said, a 'no' vote tomorrow to ensure that we vote in this Parliament on the first consent procedure under Lisbon against a bad agreement for this whole Parliament."
"This is not a sectarian issue for us but a factual issue."
"This is an issue about whether a badly drafted agreement serves the interests of security and anti-terrorism."
"As one of my advisers once said - and he is a lawyer, I used to be a lawyer and Mr Kirkhope was also a lawyer - quoting Benjamin Franklin: He who would put security so far before liberty deserves neither."
"So we all agree that, for the EU citizens, a good agreement is what we want."
"Now in Coreper, it is absolutely true that the Council came up with all the issues that we as a group regarded as the important issues."
"Mrs Clinton, too, in her letter acknowledged that Parliament had a point, but neither of these documents went further and gave us a blueprint for solving this problem, and that is why a 'no' will, in our view, push towards a better agreement for the whole Parliament."
"So we, in our group, are appealing across the House and not just within our group, to support the rapporteur in what she is trying to do, a better agreement to fight terrorism."
"No one has the moral high ground here; we want an effective fight against terrorism, that means a better agreement and that is what we will be recommending to the Socialist and Democrats this evening in our group."
"(ES) Mr President, I reject the methods and the time used for this agreement."
"Parliament's role is an essential part of the Treaty of Lisbon and it should be respected by all parties concerned."
"Moving on to the substance of this issue: the greatest damage a democratic society can do to terrorism is to cut off its financial resources."
"That is why the interim agreement should remain in place while the definitive agreement is urgently negotiated."
"On at least nine proven occasions, SWIFT and TFTP have demonstrated their effectiveness and value in preventing and suppressing terrorist activities in Europe, Asia, Africa and America, in relation to the text of the interim agreement and data protection."
"Which report should prevail, ladies and gentlemen?"
"That of the European Data Protection Supervisor or those of the special Judge, for both are well-founded yet contradictory."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, we have neither held a debate nor reached a solution on this issue."
"The wording of the interim agreement guarantees rights."
"It states that data provided shall be processed exclusively for the prevention of terrorism or its financing; that no copies of data provided shall be made; that data provided shall not be interconnected with any other database; and that only public security authorities shall have access to data."
"I trust the government of the United States and the great democracy by which it is established."
"We have an obligation to strengthen our relations with that country, for we are natural, mutually reliable partners."
"For all these reasons, I support a House vote in favour of the interim agreement and I welcome the very positive move Parliament has made to assert its authority, and the fact that Mrs Clinton and Mr Geithner have acknowledged that authority as an indispensable element now and in the future."
"Finally, Mr President, the Council and the Commission know what is expected of them."
"An interinstitutional agreement is urgently needed."
"Mr President, a simple letter from the Council that the negotiation guidelines will fully contain Parliament's concerns, that negotiations will begin immediately with the United States and not at some point in the future, and that Parliament will be fully involved in these negotiations might have sufficed, and it would not be that difficult to give in order to alleviate this Parliament's concerns about the way it has been treated, ignored and played with in the past."
"But you could not do even this today."
"The bulk transfer of data, the Commissioner said, is not a problem."
"Only some data will go there."
"SWIFT tells us that is not the case."
"The United States administration tells us that is not the case."
"There is no proof of what you say in this statement."
"You mentioned the negotiating guidelines that you are nearly done with. Where are they?"
"Given the pressure that exists today, why can you not tell us exactly where you agree and where you disagree with Parliament, instead of making general statements?"
"I feel it is extremely important to fight together with the United States against terrorism."
"I urge the United States and Council to work very seriously together with us after our vote tomorrow, and not to choose bilateral routes or dream about breaking the solidarity, but to work together to protect fundamental rights while we protect security."
"(DE) Mr President, anyone who has followed the many discussions about SWIFT over recent weeks might get the impression that without SWIFT, we would descend into chaos and that rejecting the agreement would bring an end to the transatlantic relationship and the joint war on terror."
"These attempts to threaten us can be described in one word: ridiculous."
"The US and the Council are not trying to rescue an essential tool; they are simply saving face."
"There are many agreements and measures in place to combat terrorism."
"SWIFT could be a useful addition to these."
"The failed attack on 25 December has clearly demonstrated that it is not data we are lacking, but the ability to make effective use of the data which we already have."
"The idea is to divert attention away from this fact."
"The interim agreement simply could not be worse."
"It is full of contradictions and inconsistencies."
"Instead of suitable precautions being taken to ensure that only data relating to people who are actually under suspicion is transferred, huge volumes of data will be sent to the US every month."
"The agreement represents a flagrant breach of citizens' rights, data protection and the principles of the rule of law."
"If the Council and the US were really prepared to take on board this criticism and to incorporate these points into a new agreement, then there would be no need for us to accept this dreadful agreement."
"In the interests of the citizens, we must say no to the interim agreement and we must start new negotiations immediately, so that we can put in place a really good agreement which acts as an additional, effective tool for combating terrorism and which preserves our fundamental rights."
"(ES) Mr President, the Treaty of Lisbon has opened a new chapter for this Parliament, but also for the Council and the Commission."
"In his speech, the President-in-Office of the Council has taken note that this Parliament should be listened to and that its concerns and demands should be taken into account."
"He has also noted that the negotiation of this agreement was not conducted very well, or well enough."
"Above all, however, he put forward a future commitment: to urgently negotiate a definitive agreement that meets the demands set out in the rapporteur's report, which include the demand for a guaranteed right to appeal, to information and to the subsequent modification or deletion of private data."
"We therefore have to strike a new balance between privacy, citizens' freedom, and security, which is also a fundamental right of the citizens we represent in this Parliament."
"So, whatever the outcome of the debate, Parliament urges the Minister to begin that negotiation as soon as possible and to thereby satisfy the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the 500 million citizens that this Parliament represents, who have a fundamental right to security."
"(DE) Mr President, in the era of mobility, we cannot have security without an effective and rapid exchange of data and our job is to protect our citizens against terrorist attacks."
"Therefore, we must find a balance between security and privacy."
"This balance must be reflected in the agreement that we are currently debating."
"However, given the importance of this issue, the Council has taken a really amateurish approach in this case."
"Therefore, I would like to see more concessions made to the rapporteur, including some specific help, so that we can perhaps achieve a majority in Parliament."
"If we do not have this, then the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme will remain a single central programme and it will be important for us to ensure that SWIFT only transfers individual items of data."
"If we do not have this, then the full agreement is the right thing and the current agreement remains important."
"Therefore, I believe that we should aim for a postponement and then ultimately ...."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Colleagues, this is a very important discussion."
"I do not want to disturb you but you are all talking half a minute longer than you should."
"There are 11 people on the list."
"If you all talk for such a long time then I cannot give the floor to the others."
"(DE) Mr President, no one has any serious doubts about the need to combat terrorism."
"However, the question for advanced democracies based on the rule of law always concerns what should be done and how it should be done."
"In this case, this question is easy to answer."
"We must not act in such a way that 500 million people are placed under suspicion and that there is a massive intrusion on their rights, without giving them recourse to legal protection."
"In particular, these measures must not be put in place with a total disregard for existing democratic regulations."
"Now Parliament is in the position of having to carry the can for the actions of the arrogant Swedish Presidency."
"We must not do this."
"Therefore, I am in favour of voting against this agreement tomorrow."
"(SV) Mr President, I want to say that nothing will be stopped - no terrorist act will be stopped - by this proposal."
"None of the four attacks mentioned by the Council Presidency would have been stopped, although perhaps the subsequent investigations would have been made easier."
"This agreement reduces security in the same way that any total surveillance law on the Internet reduces security, because if there is total surveillance, people will try to avoid it - even honest citizens."
"Then anonymisation services are created on the web, just as now in the banking sector."
"If terrorists can hide among ordinary people, security is reduced."
"It is a poor agreement."
"Instead I call for a complete review of all these anti-terrorism laws."
"What do they cost and what is their collective effect on privacy and liberty?"
"Only then will I even consider voting in favour of even more anti-terrorism laws."
"Show us how effective these measures are using open documents, not secret ones."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw attention to two matters, which, in my opinion, are very important."
"It is indisputable that we should fight terrorism, but the discussion is about how this should be done, and what kind of agreements should be signed with the Americans on this."
"I would like to raise two matters."
"The first of these is that the agreement affects only one of the parties - it is a one-sided agreement."
"Have we thought that the appropriate services in European states could also obtain data from the USA, and that this would facilitate the fight against terrorism here in Europe?"
"The second matter - the basic objection concerns the fact that it will be possible to obtain all financial data."
"I strongly emphasise the word 'all'."
"I think we should work towards allowing American and European special services to obtain data only from those entities which are under suspicion."
"(RO) The Council sent the agreement to the European Parliament very late, which is extraordinary."
"I hope that there will be no more recurrences of incidents of this nature."
"On the other hand, I have been very pleasantly surprised by the intensive cooperation between the US authorities and the European Parliament."
"Unexpectedly, they have listened to this institution, something which I hope will be repeated in the future."
"I am expecting the same level of interest from the US authorities as well regarding the equal treatment of Member States in relation to the Visa Waiver programme."
"The United States have yet to introduce clear, transparent criteria for refusing visas in certain Member States."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the temporary agreement must be supported because it will contribute to the security of European citizens."
"However, the approval of this agreement must not halt the negotiations with the United States on a long-term agreement, which will include all the objections raised by this Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, today, the Council has admitted that the results of the negotiations may not have been as good as they could have been."
"We should pick up on this and take the opportunity to improve the agreement."
"However, simply postponing matters will not help, because the postponement process is not governed by any conditions."
"We will therefore find ourselves in exactly the same situation again during the next plenary session."
"I do not believe that this will change anything."
"Secondly, I would like to say that we have already had enough promises that things will be better during the next round of negotiations without the involvement of Parliament."
"We have already been promised before this agreement that this time things would be quite different."
"Once again, postponement will not help."
"The only thing that will help in this case is to send out a clear signal."
"Thirdly, the security loopholes which people have repeatedly claimed will be created if we do not vote in favour of the interim agreement simply do not exist."
"We have legal reports that prove this and we have agreements on mutual legal assistance."
"Mr President, the security of our citizens is of paramount interest to us all, and it is all too easy for us to be painted as soft on fighting terrorism when we stand and ask for the civil liberties of our citizens to be protected."
"I have seen that happen time and time again by many national parliamentarians when it comes to actions that this House takes."
"SWIFT has, of course, many examples of success, and we support all of those examples, but it is equally important also to concentrate our minds on those instances where SWIFT has failed or let us down."
"There have been many failed or bad investigations in the European Union."
"In my constituency alone, 12 innocent people were detained and were not able to be charged."
"At the time they were detained, we were informed that financial transactions were part of the substantial evidence against them."
"What can we learn from those bad instances?"
"Council, let us step back."
"We have time."
"Our backs are not against the wall."
"There is a way forward."
"Let us defer."
"Council, go back; do this properly - not for the sake of this House, but for the sake of our citizens."
"(PT) Mr President, in my country, if a police officer wishes to gain access to a bank account, he has to have a warrant."
"I cannot accept an agreement whereby thousands or millions of bank details are transferred to an American police officer for perusal without requiring the permission of a court."
"The interim agreement that was negotiated lacks data protection."
"Data protection is not a luxury - it is a prerequisite of our freedom."
"There is a lack of reciprocity and a lack of proportionality."
"We cannot allow this."
"We certainly hope that the final agreement will be properly negotiated."
"How can it be negotiated?"
"Is it negotiated from a poor basis or a reasonable basis?"
"I believe that it is better for us not to have a bad interim agreement than to have any agreement at all."
"If we refuse the interim agreement, it means that we have a good base for negotiating the final agreement."
"(SK) The saying goes that good agreements are made by equal partners."
"The agreement being drawn up at the moment, however, does not indicate that we are an equal partner but rather that the United States is making demands of us and is expecting that we will comply with its views."
"Following the Lisbon Treaty, however, the European Parliament has much more power and the task as MEPs sitting here is really to defend the interests and rights, the fundamental rights, of the 500 million citizens of the EU Member States."
"I therefore also support the motion for this agreement to be reworked and for it to incorporate the proposals that we, the Members of the European Parliament, who are the only directly elected representatives in all of the EU institutions, expect to be incorporated into the agreement."
"I know that there are countries in the European Union that have enormous problems with terrorism."
"Finally, Spain is one of the countries that have been fighting terrorism for a long time and I believe that in this case, the Council will be the partner of the European Parliament and not the partner of the United States of America."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that I have listened with great interest and appreciation to all of the speeches made by the honourable Members, speeches of both support and criticism, although admittedly, the latter were in the majority, but I welcome them all."
"I would like to say firstly that I am very pleased to have confirmed once again during the debate in this House that Parliament, the Commission, and the Council are all perfectly in tune when it comes to defending our shared values and, as I said in my speech, to taking a determined stance against any kind of terrorism."
"In my opinion, this consensus is extremely important, and we should not forget it."
"I want to make a distinction between the two radically different strands of criticism that we have heard with regard to the SWIFT agreement which we have examined this afternoon: criticism on the grounds of procedure, and criticism on the grounds of substance."
"It is true that there has been constant criticism of the substance of this agreement, even by those Members who explicitly supported an agreement such as this."
"I reiterate what I said in my earlier speech, that things could probably have been done better; in fact, they could certainly have been done better."
"However, I also said, and I reiterate this too, that as the honourable Members know well, the time limits were as they were, so that the Council and the Commission had to take action within a very short time frame."
"In any case, let me be very clear that as I said earlier this afternoon, it is the Council's wish that things be done differently from now on, and not as they have been done in the past."
"Certain Members have said, probably based on their experience, that this is a promise, a commitment, which has been broken repeatedly in this House."
"I would like to say in support of the Council that it is a commitment born out of a fundamental commitment within the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets a core objective that this House should play an increasingly important role in the institutional life of Europe, so that the citizens feel better represented."
"This commitment from my country, which is a fundamental commitment within the Treaty of Lisbon, is the reason why I want to state here categorically that during the Spanish Presidency, the Council will do things differently."
"In case some people do not trust the Council's word, and they would be within their rights not to, they should remember that the treaty forces us to do things differently."
"Therefore, if the political will of the Council does not suffice, the treaty is in place within the law to ensure that things are done differently in the future."
"It is reliant on this House working with the Commission, and naturally reliant on the united spirit shown here by our Members, a spirit that seeks a balance between defending security and maintaining our core values; it is a pan European spirit, with which the Council is fully in tune."
"I would like to make three comments regarding the issue itself."
"I will not address some of the more specific issues that have been the object of criticism, some of which is unfounded in my opinion."
"For example, it has been said on various occasions that the SWIFT agreement, as it now stands in this House, permits the bulk transfer of data."
"It has not been said, and it should be stated clearly however, that this is not the logic behind the agreement, and that bulk transfer is only allowed by the SWIFT agreement in exceptional cases, always and only when there are legal suspicions (Article 4(6) of the agreement)."
"This is just one example."
"There have been other somewhat superficial accusations about the content of the agreement, which I believe would respond well to scrutiny, but I am not going to address them at this point."
"I would like to make two more points on this matter."
"Firstly, along with the Commission and some of the Members of this House, I would like to stress that the agreement has been useful in the fight against terrorism."
"I have given some examples, and there are more in Judge BruguiÃ¨re's report, which has been given to the Members."
"I can provide another example, or even better, two, which I previously referred to from my own country."
"It is true that the SWIFT agreement was used to investigate the 11 March attacks in Madrid, with good results."
"It is also worth remembering that the SWIFT agreement was used to prevent an attack on the city of Barcelona just over a year ago."
"The perpetrators of these attacks are all currently serving sentences in Spanish prisons."
"Therefore, we can say that yes, it has worked, and yes, it has allowed us to get results."
"This being the case, then surely the honourable Members will agree with me that a suspension of the agreement will effectively mean at least a slight lowering in standards of security for European citizens."
"Surely, you must accept that if the agreement is working and has been working for us, then its suspension would leave us somewhat less secure, and I am choosing my words carefully so that no one can accuse the Council of being overdramatic."
"We would certainly be a little less secure; it is as simple as that."
"That is why I want to emphasise on behalf of the Council, and I think that the Commission also agrees, that it is vital not to suspend this agreement."
"It may be that this agreement warrants criticism, and I want to stress once again that we acknowledge the tough criticism that we have heard here this afternoon."
"However, the honourable Members will surely agree with me in saying that this agreement is a lot better than the protocol over data exchange that the United States and the EU have had to comply with for years."
"The agreement under debate today is probably not perfect."
"Improvements could certainly be made, and I can even agree with some of the criticisms made from certain quarters, but I ask you to acknowledge, as I do, that it is an improvement on what we had before."
"The EU, Council, and Commission have introduced several motions into the agreement, which are causing concern amongst some Members, who are trying primarily to guarantee that security is not at the expense of human rights and fundamental freedoms; and rightly so."
"This is why I want to reiterate what the Commissioner said, that it is important not to suspend the agreement."
"I also want to reiterate to Parliament that the Council's sincere wish is to negotiate a new agreement - which will be a definitive one - an agreement which will incorporate many of the issues mentioned here this afternoon, issues which the Council agrees with and would like to publicly endorse."
"The Council is making a commitment to do this."
"The fact is that the President-in-Office of the Council has already made this commitment in a letter to the President of Parliament, but we will still have to uphold it when the time comes to negotiate."
"Therefore, we are debating an interim agreement today which improves the current situation."
"We are debating an agreement that will last for nine months, which is the time it will take for the Commission, the Council, and Parliament to reach a new agreement - which will be a definitive one - an agreement that will most certainly address all the very reasonable precautionary measures discussed in this afternoon's debate in Parliament."
"The Council cannot ignore this afternoon's debate."
"We cannot ignore the fact that this agreement has come in for a great deal of criticism."
"As I said, some of the criticisms have certainly been more founded than others, but criticism there has been, and I think that this deserves serious consideration."
"I am asking on behalf of the Council, that Parliament give us this time for reflection."
"Time, naturally, to analyse and discuss this debate with my colleagues in the Council, time to discuss it with the Commission, and time, essentially, to explore the possibility of making a better agreement with the US, which I think is a real possibility."
"We are asking for time, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, to allow us to come back to Parliament within a few weeks, a few months, to be able to guarantee that we have created the foundations for the signing of a definitive agreement that adequately addresses the concerns expressed by certain honourable Members today."
"Concerns, which, I repeat, echo the Council's concerns in many cases."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this has been an extremely important debate."
"That is totally accurate because we talk about such important matters as how we can maintain the security of our citizens but also maintain good information and exchange systems with a high level of data protection."
"There have been, as the President of the Council said, a few questions, and a few misunderstandings, I think."
"Some of them are answered in the BruguiÃ¨re report, so I would really encourage you to read that."
"But I think we need to understand and remember why we have an interim agreement."
"Why do we have it?"
"Well, it was because SWIFT was moving and we were finding ourselves in a situation where we did not have a regulation on the transfer of data, so the Council and the Commission moved swiftly to arrange something."
"We did achieve certain concessions from the United States and some very good data protection mechanisms."
"Also, two member countries concerned asked the Commission to be involved in order to have a European approach on this and avoid bilateral agreements."
"This is important to recall."
"Now this is an interim agreement, as I said; it can and it will be improved."
"It is the full intention of the Commission and the Council to involve the European Parliament under the Lisbon Treaty in the permanent agreement."
"We need to have more clarification concerning redress, lawful data processing and deletion of data."
"The permanent agreement will also include guarantees of rectification, access to information."
"Mr Lambrinidis asked why the Commission does not have that."
"Well, Mr Lambrinidis, the Commission has been in office for 16 hours and 20 minutes."
"This is an extremely important negotiating mandate."
"We need to be able to discuss this together, within the new Commission, before we formulate the full negotiating mandate to discuss with the European Parliament."
"We have only very recently taken office so you could not expect us to have done this."
"But we will make sure - and Mr Barroso expressed this very clearly in the letter to Mr Buzek - that we are working on the negotiating mandate; we will present it to the European Parliament as soon as possible and make sure that you are fully informed the whole way on this."
"It might be a very good idea to postpone the vote and we might need more time to discuss the mandate."
"You will see the negotiation mandate; you will have time to look at the papers, the reports and so on, and the Commission is willing, as I said, to work together with you and the Council for a good - and much better - permanent agreement on this."
"Colleagues, the blue card rule does not operate during presentations by the Council and Commission, but this is an extremely important discussion."
"We must take a decision tomorrow."
"This is not according to the Rules, but could I ask you, Mr President-in-Office, to take two short - and I emphasise short - questions from Mr Schulz and Mr Lambrinidis - nothing more, as we could discuss this for another two hours."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba, I have listened carefully to what you have said, along with all the Members of this House."
"You have used the following words: 'Give me more time to discuss this with the other members of the Council."
"Give me more time to come back to you with a better agreement.'"
"I would therefore like to ask you very specifically whether it is the case that the Council is no longer insisting on this agreement and on the vote on this agreement and whether you want to have to time to negotiate with the US on a new and improved agreement."
"Have I understood what you said correctly?"
"Mr President, is the Council aware of the fact that in the past years, SWIFT has never once transmitted specific data because it cannot extract it, and always transfers bulk data?"
"Is the Council aware of the fact that, precisely because of that, there is an agreement between the US and SWIFT that stations SWIFT personnel in the Treasury Department in order to ensure that the bulk data the Treasury gets does not get searched in a bulk manner?"
"Is the Council aware of the fact that the interim agreement does not include even the slightest concession to Parliament?"
"If I am right - which I hope I am - are the Council and the Commission committed to taking the bulk data issue extremely seriously in the mandate of the negotiations?"
"Mr President, the Council would like to reiterate once again how important it is that we do not cut off the flow of financial data exchange between Europe and the United States."
"However, the Council is also mindful of the fact that the precautionary measures, criticisms, and suggestions of the honourable Members must be the subject of serious consideration."
"For this reason, I have asked for time to work with all the countries of the European Union, with all the Member States, to look at whether we need to incorporate this type of consideration into the new agreement."
"Even more importantly, I have asked for time to consult with the United States."
"I believe that the USA is willing to incorporate into the new agreement many of the precautionary measures, reservations, and restrictions expressed here today by the European Parliament."
"In short, it is willing to seek a greater balance between security and freedom in the definitive agreement, which is essentially what we are talking about today."
"I would like time to explore this possibility so that I can come back to Parliament and say, in a session such as this one, before proceeding to the vote, that the Commission and the Council have a commitment from the United States to incorporate these suggestions from the European Parliament into the new agreement."
"Under these conditions, I think that we would have a very different debate from the one we are having here this afternoon."
"(DE) Mr President, that is very helpful."
"Thank you very much for making this possible."
"If I have understood things correctly, because this is a sensitive issue that we are discussing, then Mr Rubalcaba cannot assure us that the existing agreement will not come into force."
"In other words, if we postpone matters and give ourselves more time, it will come into effect."
"Therefore, my next question is: Can Mr Rubalcaba assure us that, for example, a long-term agreement will be in place within a month with higher standards or is the Council telling us that we must still wait nine months until the end of the period?"
"It is very hard for Parliament to accept an unconditional assurance."
"Therefore, we must have clear conditions relating to the Council's assurance, in order to be able to decide tomorrow about a possible postponement."
"(ES) Mr President, thank you for applying the House's Rules of Procedure with generosity, and allowing the two representatives to speak, firstly from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, and secondly from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Mr Rubalcaba, you have put your finger on it."
"Most of the arguments put forward for debate in the House have been fair ones."
"I have great respect for everything that has been said."
"However, these words should have a documental and informative component, with full knowledge of the facts, and frankly, I have been very surprised to hear certain statements that suggest otherwise."
"Such statements give the impression that very few people have actually read the agreement that they are criticising, since having read it, there is no way they could have come up with some of these arguments."
"That is why I want to ask you, Mr Rubalcaba, about the matter mentioned by my colleague, Mr Manfred Weber, and by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert in her letter (as you already know I am in favour of keeping the interim agreement whilst negotiating a new agreement)."
"In her letter, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert asks the same question as Manfred Weber."
"Can the Council guarantee to Parliament that with the participation of this House, it will present the final text of the new agreement, in committee in June, and in plenary in July?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) Mr President, some of the honourable Members are calling for an interim agreement and others for a permanent agreement."
"With regard to the timing, it is clearly not the same to bring to this House the foundations of a definitive agreement, or in other words, to bring a commitment from the United States to include some of the precautionary measures and suggestions put forward by this House, as it is to bring a new agreement to the table."
"If the honourable Member is asking me whether we can bring a new agreement to this House in one month's time, the answer is no."
"If you are asking whether, within a deadline of a few months, we can bring to this House the results of dialogue between the United States and Parliament, whose participation is very important, so that we can debate whether we are right in thinking that the definitive agreement will be much better than the present one, my answer is yes."
"In my opinion, we are capable of achieving this."
"This is precisely what I am asking for."
"Therefore, I am not specifically referring to the rapporteur's proposal, which I admit I have not seriously considered this afternoon after assessing the general mood and the multiple actions and speeches against the signing of the interim agreement."
"Let me reiterate my opinion that things being as they are, it is a much more realistic option to ask the House for a deadline of say three months, to give us time to bring forward the foundations of an agreement with the United States for debate in Parliament."
"In other words, this agreement would include the elements that we in the EU (Commission, Council and Parliament) and the United States believe should be incorporated into the definitive agreement that would subsequently be negotiated."
"I believe that in these circumstances, the debate we are having today would be radically different."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, a lot has been said."
"Let me underline to Mr Busuttil and the President-in-Office, in particular, that by our withholding our consent on the interim agreement, the security of European citizens is not being compromised."
"I think it is very unfair to use that as a form of argument."
"Other legal instruments remain available for targeted transatlantic data exchange and, as stated by Claude Moraes, nobody has the moral high ground here."
"With regard to the USA letter, that letter is obviously appreciated, there is no doubt about that, but to state that Parliament's views will be heard, considered and responded to is a bit weak, is it not?"
"It is very non-committal."
"Also, it is stated that this is only provided this interim agreement remains in force, which I consider as pure blackmail."
"I am getting angry and I am sorry for that, but this debate is slowly getting on my nerves."
"TFTP is not, and cannot be considered to be, consistent with the strongest European traditions on civil liberties."
"It must be seen, and I want it acknowledged, as a departure from European law and practice."
"I said this before and I want to hear it again clearly."
"I also want to say that nobody doubts the necessity for continued and stronger cooperation between the US and the EU, though the EU and its Member States, in the Council in particular, must be strong in setting their own objectives."
"In that respect, Parliament and the Council are not in tune yet."
"Finally, let me stress that it is all about European responsibility, and a European solution is to be found."
"The Netherlands and Belgium cannot end up being the 'dupe' of all this."
"I listened carefully to your statements, to the request for more time, and I am willing to refer that request to the Conference of Presidents, but you did not give me the reassurances I was looking for: it was too vague."
"I will, however, refer your request to the Conference of Presidents which will meet later this afternoon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 10 February 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Cooperation with the United States to combat terrorism is important, but not at any price."
"The agreement with the United States on the transfer of financial data rather comes down to opening and reading the personal mail of all European citizens or monitoring all their e-mail exchanges on the pretext that terrorists are likely to send each other letters or electronic messages."
"The agreement we are talking about does not guarantee respect for personal data and still less for the use to which they may be put."
"The risk of meddling in the private lives of millions of innocent citizens or in the perfectly legal financial transactions of European companies, simply on the orders of an administration, is unacceptable."
"I still remember the 'Echelon' affair, that listening system that was allegedly intended for military and security purposes and which proved to be an alarming potential commercial and political spy system directed against the allies."
"We can accept an exchange, that is to say, a reciprocal transfer, of targeted data on request from a judicial authority in a specific context."
"We certainly want to help SWIFT break the technical deadlock that prevents it from carrying out anything other than mass data transfers."
"However, we cannot accept this agreement."
"Mr President, we are recommending to our fellow Members that they vote against this report with the aim of giving the members of the Council and the Commission the opportunity to make some adjustments and thereby alter their position."
"We very much hope they will seize this opportunity."
"For the rest, France has just decided to sell a Mistral class warship to Russia; we believe that it will sincerely regret its action."
"The threat of terrorism is not getting smaller."
"The recent attempt by a suicide bomber to blow up an aircraft flying from Europe to the USA shows there are people who are ready to kill hundreds of innocent people in the name of fanatical convictions."
"It would, however, be a mistake to view acts of terror exclusively as the deeds of desperate individuals."
"For behind all terrorists is an organisation which trained them, supplied them with explosives and financed them."
"Terrorism has to be well organised to survive, and for this it principally needs money."
"We must not stop in our efforts to track financial movements and establish the source of funds used to support terrorism."
"Efficient exchange of information between governments and mutual assistance in identifying suspicious people and organisations is a matter of paramount importance for ensuring security for our citizens."
"We should make every effort to ensure that the final agreement guarantees the necessary protection of personal data."
"We must not forget, however, that our primary objective should be to limit terrorism, because terrorism is still a real threat, including in Europe."
"When we are talking about security, political games should be set aside."
"The European Parliament should not make a show of its authority by rejecting the interim agreement with the USA on the processing of financial messaging data, because this agreement improves the security of our continent."
"Body scanners - Operation of intelligence services in the context of counter-terrorism strategies (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on combating terrorism and the statements by the Council and the Commission on body scanners and the operation of intelligence services in the context of counter-terrorism strategies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin this debate by thanking Parliament for the opportunity to hold a calm debate on counter-terrorism policy, and on certain elements of counter-terrorism policy in particular."
"I also applaud the timing of this debate, as a reasonable amount of time has elapsed since the worldwide commotion caused by the failed attack in Detroit in December of last year."
"Of course, when something like this happens, when it comes to tackling a threat such as the threat of terrorism, I believe in making a response, but I am much more in favour of working quietly and continuously, slowly but surely, as we say in my country."
"I would emphasise to the House that the threat of terrorism is still as real as it was in all of the EU countries."
"We know that the terrorists observe us, we know that they are innovative and try to change their methods to evade our strategies in the fight against terrorism."
"Our strategy also needs to be innovative and varied because of this; it needs to improve and, most importantly, we must learn from our mistakes, since we certainly do make mistakes."
"This being said, we are all aware that if there had not been a failed attack in Detroit in December, we would probably not be debating this issue in the terms that we are in this House."
"In other words, this debate is born from the need for precautions, and especially for conclusions, which we have all drawn from examining the success in Detroit that I just mentioned."
"At the core of today's debate is also an analysis of where we failed in dealing with the alleged attack, and the measures that different countries are adopting to prevent those mistakes from being made again."
"Therefore, we are talking about analysing data, about counter-terrorism services; we are talking about exchanging data, and we are talking about body scanners."
"We are talking about mistakes made in an attack that fortunately did not happen."
"Given that this is the subject of our debate, I would like to mention some of the most obvious conclusions that I think we can draw from the failed attack on Detroit."
"There are five conclusions."
"Firstly, Detroit highlights the fact that terrorists continue to target civil aviation as a priority."
"Secondly, Detroit highlights the importance of collecting data, but also of integrating and analysing it."
"Thirdly, Detroit highlights that the associates of al-Qaeda are in a position to launch attacks outside of what we would call their own territory."
"This applies to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (the terrorist organisation suspected of being behind the failed attack in Detroit) or al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb countries, who represent a threat to us all."
"The fourth conclusion I have drawn is that the events in Detroit should remind us how important it is to work on reversing the process of radicalisation."
"In my opinion, the personality of suspected terrorists is a very significant factor in relation to this issue."
"Lastly, Detroit calls for us to pay close attention to failed states, or to any states that are in danger of becoming failed states due to their circumstances."
"The first and second conclusions concern the ongoing threat to civil aviation and the need to integrate all of the data available to us; they lead us directly to this afternoon's debate or debates, regarding data and its use, and body scanners."
"I should say that this is not a new debate, nor is it the first time we have debated it in this House."
"Mr de Kerchove, the Counter-terrorism Coordinator, talked about information management and personal data protection in his interesting and lucid report during a debate on the subject in this House on 26 November."
"Data and analysis of data are a key element in the struggle to prevent and deal with terrorism, which is the subject of this afternoon's debate."
"We need to identify terrorists; we need to know where they are planning to attack, who is providing them with weapons; we need to know the material infrastructure supporting them; we need to know their communication systems; and we can find this out by means of databases and specialised sources."
"We need data exchange so that we can obtain all the available information, and we must manage it properly."
"I hasten to add that some of the attacks that we have suffered in the past could have been avoided if the information had been made available in good time to those responsible for counter-terrorist measures; in other words, if the information had been handled in an integrated, and if you will pardon the expression, an intelligent manner, which does not always happen."
"This brings us to the debate on information management."
"We have the framework of the EU within which we can exchange information appropriately."
"Our recently adopted strategy formed part of the Council's conclusions last November."
"It aims to provide the security forces and intelligence services with the necessary data, in the interests of improving the usefulness and effectiveness of the counter-terrorist strategy."
"The necessary data and only that, nothing more, since bulk data sometimes has a negative effect on its own value and effectiveness."
"As this strategy indicates, the decisions regarding data exchange should be of a coherent, professional, efficient, viable, reliable nature, and understandable for all the citizens and all the professionals who work with it."
"According to its guidelines, the strategy must bear in mind the statements and concerns that we have dealt with in this House; the need to fight against terrorism, as well as the issues of human rights, the right to privacy, and to protection of personal data."
"As I said at the beginning of the debate, another of the consequences that we can draw from the alleged Detroit attack is that commercial aircraft continue to be a fundamental target for terrorists."
"Obviously, the alleged terrorist succeeded in boarding the aircraft with a sufficient quantity of explosives to cause it to explode in the air, thus thwarting all of our surveillance systems and all of our airport security systems and mechanisms."
"In other words, we obviously need to review these security mechanisms, because they were clearly insufficient for preventing an attack such as the alleged Detroit attack, which fortunately did not take place."
"To summarise, we must keep on improving our security services, to try to avoid terrorists or suspected terrorists boarding commercial flights."
"We have to prevent anyone being able to board a plane with weapons, explosives or chemical precursors of explosives."
"In case these two safety measures fail us, we need to do more to protect our planes and avoid in-flight incidents."
"This is precisely the framework for the debate that we are having on an issue of concern within this House and the Council, the issue of body scanners."
"As the honourable Members know, in matters of air safety, the Commission holds the relevant jurisdiction to set targets and make regulations."
"These matters are debated in the formal and informal Council of Transport Ministers."
"However, I would like to mention that this matter of air security was the subject of a debate in the informal Council of Ministers, which took place a few weeks ago in Toledo."
"We agreed on various matters in this Council: firstly, that it is correct and appropriate for the EU to hold a common position on body scanners and, more generally, on all of the protection mechanisms in our airports; it does not make sense that some airports are less protected than others, because it essentially means that we are all less protected."
"As such, we would be pleased if the European Union could reach an agreement, and hold a common position in this debate."
"Secondly, on a more difficult, delicate matter, where there are different aspects to consider: firstly and obviously, to find out how efficient this type of body scanner is in preventing terrorists from boarding planes with explosives, or chemical precursors to explosives."
"Secondly, we need to find out and analyse if these scanners are compatible with people's right to privacy and intimacy, which is of concern to the Council, the Commission, and to this House."
"The third matter we agreed on is to find out if there could be any health risks for those who pass through this machine to board commercial flights."
"With regard to these three issues: the Commission is working on three studies regarding the efficiency of body scanners, their effect on health, and on their compatibility with people's human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"These studies will be available to the Council and this House in the near future."
"For this reason, the informal Council in Toledo agreed to research and provide this information, so that we can have a thorough debate, and hopefully reach a unanimous position on this matter, which would be very desirable."
"Once we have achieved this common position, we will take fully into account the Resolution that this Parliament passed on 23 October 2008, after a debate on body scanners."
"During the debate, we discussed the need for an evaluation of the impact on human rights, the health risks and the economic impact, as well as the need for consultation with the European Data Protection Supervisor."
"These considerations must be taken into account in our next debate."
"I would like to reiterate my thanks to this House for the opportunity to debate these issues, and my thanks to Parliament for its flexibility regarding the timing of the debate."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we are here to present a combined view on certain aspects in the fight against terrorism."
"My priority as Transport Commissioner is definitely the safety and security of passengers."
"This is a major priority for our common transport policy and this is always extremely important."
"The attempted terrorist attack on Northwest Airlines flight 253 to Detroit on 25 December has again confirmed the reality of the threat to civil aviation."
"I would like to stress that existing EU standards on aviation security were correctly implemented on 25 December at Amsterdam Schiphol airport."
"The incident showed first of all the failure of intelligence, a failure 'to connect the dots'."
"Aviation remains a target for terrorists."
"We cannot ignore this fact."
"Aviation security must therefore be guaranteed by all appropriate means, in full compliance with fundamental rights."
"The travelling public, the media and aviation stakeholders all legitimately ask us whether the existing security arrangements are good enough, or whether we need to take further action."
"In this regard, the new screening technologies, the so-called 'body scanners', are discussed everywhere today."
"Regarding the use of body scanners at airports, aviation security experts are of the opinion that these machines have better detection capacity than current screening equipment."
"Some think that they are considerably better."
"Some think that this is not such a big advance, but how big the added value of these machines is to airport security and what the consequences are for health and privacy is not yet entirely clear today."
"As noted previously by Parliament in 2008, the use of body-imaging technology raises a number of questions, notably in relation to privacy, data protection and health."
"I intend to present to you in April a report on imaging technology and its use at EU airports."
"This report will address the questions raised in the European Parliament resolution of 2008."
"We need to look at these questions seriously."
"We also need to make up our minds on whether these concerns are better addressed at national or European level."
"To my mind, an EU framework would be better."
"I say this based on our experience of a common approach since 9/11 and with a view to the efficiency of the single market for aviation."
"An EU framework guarantees uniform standards in relation both to security and to respect for individual rights."
"Finally, I would like to underline that airport security is a much larger question than the introduction of a new screening technology."
"To fight terrorism targeting civil aviation, we need a large variety of combined and coordinated measures - intelligence, profiling, different search methods and international cooperation."
"As the Minister just said, terrorists develop."
"We must develop as well, and body scanners are only one element in this variety."
"I look forward to your views and thank you for your attention."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is the Commission's new dual approach."
"As the former debate showed, now that we have the Lisbon Treaty, work at EU level now enters into a new phase."
"I am very happy and honoured that I will work together with you in the fight against terrorism and on other security-related matters."
"We will do this while, of course, fully respecting that it is the Member States who have the final responsibility for all operational and intelligence work in this field."
"I would like to recall to you - some of you were at my hearing a few weeks ago - that I made a promise that I would do an evaluation of all counter-terrorism policies."
"As a first step, I have asked my services to prepare an overview and an assessment of everything that has been achieved so far."
"This will be the basis upon which I will decide how to move forward."
"We need to evaluate and to get a full understanding of what we have, its effects, what is possibly missing and what is overlapping in order to be able to propose new measures and more thought through measures."
"I look forward to bringing this evaluation to you and to discussing it with you."
"But this stocktaking does not mean that I am not fully aware of the fact that the threat of terrorism has not diminished."
"As my colleague, Mr Kallas, and the Council Presidency have said, we know that terrorism is still one of the greatest threats to our values and to our democracies."
"The Denver flight showed that recently."
"We have statistics from Europol showing that in 2008, EU Member States reported a total of 515 failed or successfully perpetrated terrorist attacks within Europe; 359 individuals were tried on terrorist charges in a total of 187 proceedings; 50% of these were related to al-Qaeda or Islamist terrorism, and 39% to separatist terrorism, such as ETA activities in Spain."
"We also know that in 2008, we had the tragic events and the horrible bombing in Mumbai, which also targeted European citizens, among them Members of this House."
"These events and the figures from Europol speak a clear language: terrorism is still there, and it is important that we do not lower our guard and we ensure that all tools are deployed in the fight against terrorism, while of course always fully respecting fundamental rights."
"If we look at the instruments that we do have today, we have the EU counter-terrorism strategy, developed after the attacks in Madrid and in London."
"This strategy highlights the EU's commitment to combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights and to making Europe safer, allowing its citizens to live in an area of freedom, security and justice."
"This, of course, is a commitment that it still valid."
"There can be no freedom without security and there can be no security without freedom."
"That is why respecting fundamental rights in the fight against terrorism is not only a requirement of any democratic society but is a necessity in order to ensure that our policies remain credible, legitimate and sustainable."
"That is why the Commission will only propose measures that will continue to be subject to EU law screening, especially with regard to fundamental rights and rigorous impact assessment, including the impact on personal data and individuals."
"Terrorism is, as we know, a global phenomenon, and that is why we will remain dedicated to cooperating with our allies and partners and international organisations all over the world."
"Regarding the internal dimension of countering and preventing terrorism, we do have in our counter-terrorist strategy some key objectives on how the Union can contribute in the fight against terrorism."
"I fully share these objectives, in particular the need to stop violent radicalisation, protect our critical infrastructure, support victims, improve exchange of information between national authorities and cooperate with all appropriate stakeholders."
"We have to react to non-conventional threats and to improve the detection of threats."
"We have to deprive terrorists of financial resources and to invest more in research and technological development."
"This development on these policies has, of course, been strongly supported by the European Commission in cooperation with the Member States."
"Over the past year, the Commission has made a major contribution to approximating the legal frameworks of Member States in this work."
"We have, for instance, the European arrest warrant, which created an EU-wide common understanding on terrorist crime and facilitated extradition procedures within the EU Member States."
"We have also undertaken important activities to counter the terrorist abuse of the Internet, addressing conditions conducive to terrorist radicalisation, launching a European programme for the protection of critical infrastructure, and limiting access by terrorists to the means they need to commit their acts - funding and explosives."
"The EU action plan for enhancing the security of explosives foresees important measures to raise the threshold for terrorists who want to use explosives for an attack."
"I would propose a legislative framework to address the dangers associated with precursors which can be used to fabricate improvised explosive devices."
"I will do so this year."
"We also have the CBRN action plan proposed by the Commission last June and agreed by the Council."
"This Action Plan consists of 130 measures."
"The Commission has earmarked up to EUR 100 million which could be made available from its existing financial programmes to facilitate implementation."
"I am fully committed to ensuring that, in the coming years, the European Commission will continue to develop its role as facilitator and catalyst for cooperation, expert networks, exchanging best practices, pooling resources, improving research and developing common approaches to transnational challenges."
"We will also have to revise how we use our financial resources."
"This might be by creating an internal security fund, which is foreseen in the Stockholm Programme."
"On a large scale, international information exchange concerning the collection of data and storage of data concerning thousands of citizens has to take account - and this was very visible in the last debate we had - of very high data protection standards in order to prevent abuse and mishandling."
"We also have to make sure, as Commissioner Kallas said, that we connect the dots in an appropriate way."
"Together with my colleague, Viviane Reding, I will submit in the near future a combined data protection regime that would also cover police and judicial cooperation."
"All this will be considered in the evaluation and it will be under the umbrella of the internal security strategy that we will put forward to you within a short time."
"Finally, let me conclude by underlining that, in the long run, we can only succeed in fighting against terrorism if we remain able to communicate our values and remain respectful of fundamental rights."
"We have to avoid our policies being perceived as ambiguous or as applying double standards."
"We can only defend high moral ground and prevent alienation from our societies and our way of living if we remain faithful to our values of democracy and the rule of law."
"You gave us a very hopeful prospect."
"Maybe one day we will have you, Mr Kallas and Ms Reding representing the Commission at the same time."
"Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba, Commissioners, I am pleased that we are not only talking about SWIFT and body scanners today, but also having a general debate on the war on terror, because this is a subject that affects us all."
"Looking back, we have to say that terrorism is a real threat to the people of Europe."
"We are taking positive action and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the public authorities."
"The people who are responsible for security have done a good job over recent years."
"I would also like to thank our partners."
"Now we must look to the future."
"What will we be faced with over the next few years?"
"In this respect, I have three specific requests or proposals."
"The first concerns cooperation among the authorities in Europe."
"Every document comes with a headline emphasising the importance of collaborating and strengthening our cooperation."
"These are wonderful words, but nothing has happened in practice."
"Once again nothing happened in Toledo with regard to practical cooperation."
"There is no lack of action - this has been made clear in Detroit."
"What we are lacking is cooperation between the authorities."
"That is where the problem lies."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the Council finally to do its job in this area and to call on the Commission to put some appropriate proposals on the table."
"My second point is that we should investigate our existing legislation with regard to the collection of data and mobile phone data, for example, in the case of the retention of data."
"For this reason, you have the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for this evaluation."
"After an interval of a few years, it is important to put it to the test."
"Thirdly, we have just had a discussion about SWIFT."
"I would like to ask the House why our cooperation with the United States has to be organised in this way."
"It has to be organised like this because we Europeans are not in the position to evaluate the data ourselves."
"Therefore, the question arises as to whether we are self-confident enough to evaluate it ourselves."
"This is another thought for the future."
"In the short time that has been allocated to me, I want, on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, to set out three important basic conditions that we think are essential in evaluating the issue of the potential introduction of body scanners, which were not long ago being pushed as the miracle cure."
"First of all, we must take a coordinated, harmonised European approach."
"We must, therefore, have European rules, or else you simply relocate the security problem and you create chaos, and the President-in-Office of the Council made reference to this, but I want to point out to the Spanish Presidency that a number of Council members have, in the meantime, adopted a solo approach, and I ask you to explicitly denounce that."
"Secondly, we need a global approach to security and counter-terrorism, and that means that we need to avoid drawing hasty conclusions, that we need to stop the politics of announcements, that the potential introduction of body scanners also cannot be seen in isolation from the broader context of other existing or potential measures and that we clearly also need to see it in the context of other aspects, such as public health and the budgetary implications."
"The third point is that we must also stop giving the impression that these body scanners will guarantee 100% security."
"You will be aware, for example, that this equipment is capable of finding explosives located on, but not in, the body."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would like to say that I therefore also support the Commission's approach in first setting up trials before bringing forward a proposal."
"Mr President, Mr Rubalcaba has rightly said that we currently do not have a secure system for air travel."
"We need more security in this area."
"The events in Detroit and Munich have shown that there are security loopholes."
"For this reason, body scanners are being introduced in a mad rush as if they were a miracle cure."
"They are already in place in the US, in the Netherlands and in other countries."
"However, this raises the issue of whether body scanners will really make air travel safer."
"This is one of the crucial questions that we must ask ourselves."
"There is, in fact, a whole series of questions relating to body scanners."
"What type of technology is being used?"
"What type of radiation do they emit?"
"Can they cause damage to health?"
"What do they allow people to see?"
"Just a few green or red dots or the whole person who is being scanned?"
"Finally, can we ensure that the data is being protected?"
"Also, these scanners are expensive."
"If we are going to install them, who will be paying?"
"There are a lot of questions to be answered and we are in the process of doing this."
"You also want to do this and present us with a solution."
"Whatever happens, we need a solution which covers the whole of Europe."
"We also need to take into consideration Tel Aviv and the possibility of using another method."
"We need to search for the bombers and not the bombs."
"We cannot adopt this method wholesale, because it involves discrimination, but we must investigate all the possibilities while protecting our fundamental rights."
"Some time ago, Parliament laid down the requirements that body scanners must comply with if they were to be introduced."
"These specifications covered privacy, data protection, human dignity, health and freedom of choice."
"There are technologies that do meet all of these requirements, meaning that x-rays, radiographs and naked images must be outmoded, which is where we are going wrong at the moment."
"At Heathrow Airport in London, this equipment is being used without the element of freedom of choice."
"New equipment is being introduced in Italy."
"The Dutch Minister for Justice is calling for this equipment to be introduced at all airports across Europe, not just for flights to the United States, but for all flights."
"If we just continue to hold the same old debate about the technology, we will continue to avoid asking the real question, the serious question, namely does this actually help and is this the society we want to see?"
"I agree with my fellow Member from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who is indeed asking these questions."
"We need to consider what kind of Europe we want to live in, because total security does not exist."
"The latest generation of scanners satisfy the requirements that Parliament has laid down."
"Security personnel see display images of human contours, with spots showing up where people are carrying liquids, weapons or other prohibited items."
"If such spots are seen, the passengers in question are checked separately on the spot."
"The latest scanners also do not have any effect on health."
"The radiation they give off is less than that from mobile phones."
"What is more, the scanners are also user-friendly."
"The queues at security will be shorter, as more passengers can be scanned every hour."
"That will therefore also make a difference to costs for air travellers."
"However, Mr President, the latest scanners are additional security tools."
"Profiling and good intelligence exchange are also very much required."
"As far as I am concerned, we can quickly move on to implementing these tools as additional tools."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) A few days ago, I received an email from a lobbyist selling body scanners."
"This email spoke of the 'post-Detroit era'."
"No surprise there."
"Each machine cost EUR 250 000."
"There is a fortune to be made by selling body scanners, but in reading the email and thinking about this post-Detroit era, after an amateur attempt made by a terrorist who was overpowered by other passengers on the plane, I asked myself whether this attack really merited having an historical era named after it."
"It did not, unless it refers to the era of sheer effrontery."
"Not everything can serve as an excuse to increase the levels of intrusion into the private lives of members of the public."
"European citizens also need to know that we in Parliament have a responsibility."
"Yes, we do indeed need to investigate terrorism."
"It is true that the police always need more data, as do airports, but it is also important to base research on clear assumptions, and there are many assumptions being made by the Council and the Commission."
"I am sorry to say that these are incorrect."
"The idea that the terrorist threat has not diminished is debatable and should be debated here."
"The idea that terrorism is evolving and that we should evolve too is true, but the first thing is to do our jobs well, because the Detroit attack, or rather the attempted attack, could very easily have been prevented."
"Now we find ourselves debating the databases and police practices of the future."
"When they discover that terrorists can ingest the materials for making bombs, will they start doing endoscopies at airports?"
"Is this where we want to end up?"
"There comes a time when this House has to sit down and discuss this matter carefully, with respect for the rights of the public."
"The European Parliament must do its utmost to ensure that the intelligence agencies do not use the war on terror as justification for torture, secret prisons or even a coup d'Ã©tat where there is resistance to this."
"Mr President, let me quote the evidence the British Ambassador in Uzbekistan, Mr Craig Murray, gave to the temporary committee of the European Parliament: 'I have seen plenty of evidence of torture in Uzbekistan."
"I have come across a file of a detainee who died during interrogation because of waterboarding in boiling water'."
"Giving evidence, another official, Sir Michael Wood, stated that, 'receipt of intelligence gained under torture is not illegal under the UN Convention Against Torture provided we do not do the torture ourselves.'"
"Can there be any greater mockery of human rights?"
"Mr President, I call on you to reopen the parliamentary inquiry and to reconvene the temporary committee on the extraordinary rendition and imprisonment of CIA prisoners in Europe."
"(NL) We need to watch out that a debate about terrorism is not narrowed down into a debate about body scanners or data protection."
"It is striking that, in their statement, the Council and the Commission did not mention the radical Islamism that is still the breeding ground and seedbed for international terrorism."
"Since we are no longer allowed to see the truth, due to political correctness, every approach is doomed to failure before it even begins."
"The Commission and Parliament put the emphasis on respecting civil rights, something which is right and necessary, but the danger is that we lose ourselves in formalism and that is what we saw in the debate about the terrorist finance tracking programme."
"Certain quarters are guilty of whipping up public sentiment against any possible approach to tackle terrorism and that is no way for us to serve the citizens of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the war against terror is the major challenge of the 21st century."
"We are facing up to this challenge on both a technical and a parliamentary level."
"In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have not only implemented regulations concerning the ban on liquids in hand luggage, but we are also looking closely at body scanners."
"I would like to say one thing first of all."
"We do not currently have complete security, as many of the other speakers have already emphasised, and we will not have it in future."
"However, we can develop natural techniques that will allow us to come close to complete security asymptotically."
"We need to take some fundamental rules into account, both outside and inside Parliament."
"We are already in agreement across all the groups that there should be as little impact as possible on the health of the passengers."
"Therefore, it is necessary for us to introduce advanced body scanners which work according to a specific principle."
"Of course, it is obvious that personal rights must be protected."
"In addition, we must not only refer to the body scanners which scan the naked body when giving examples of the type of screening to be used."
"In the Committee on Transport and Tourism, we have agreed with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that the Commission will present us with a proposal for legislation on body scanners by the end of March or early April, in any case, before the summer recess."
"There are a number of factors to be taken into account in this area."
"These include consistent cooperation between the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which is taking the leading role, and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the reliability of the equipment, European certification and establishing the same conditions throughout Europe, so that we can ensure that there is security within its continent."
"Mr President, you said that there were three Commissioners who are responsible here."
"We are very happy about this."
"May I quote the only one who is not here."
"Commissioner Reding said last week 'what we do know is that body scanners may have a considerable privacy-invasive potential and so we need full consideration of their impact'."
"That is exactly the kind of statement we should be making at this early stage."
"We in the Socialists and Democrats believe that technology can fight terrorism, and Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m rightly couched it in a wider potential legal framework which she spoke about."
"This is a serious fight."
"I have been stopped many times at airports."
"If technology can speed me through so that I am not mistaken for someone else, then that is a great thing, but for the many people I represent in my constituency who are badly treated at security, or singled out, what they want is safety."
"We will have that from the Transport Committee in this good, joint approach, but they want their civil liberties protected from the effects of terrorism so that there is no weak link at any airport."
"Those Member States that have started this should know that there should be a pan-European approach, an effective and safe approach."
"Mr President, I want to talk about respect for the rule of law by intelligence services."
"A ruling today by the UK Court of Appeal has blasted open the British Government's attempt at secrecy."
"It has confirmed, as Parliament said three years ago, the shocking truth that UK secret services did collude in the torture of British resident and rendition victim Binyan Mohamed."
"What does the Council think of that total breach of Article 6 of the EU Treaty and the Torture Convention?"
"In 2006, I led the MEP delegation from our Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition and Torture to London."
"The then UK Defence Secretary, Geoffrey Hoon, wasted half the meeting lambasting me just for saying that we were enquiring into UK complicity."
"He owes me and, more importantly, the British and European public, an apology."
"Four things now need to happen in the UK: a full independent inquiry into UK complicity in war-on-terror abuses during the years the UK Labour Government acted as a Bush poodle; a rapid police investigation and, if necessary, prosecutions for breach of the Torture Convention; disclosure of what instructions were given to UK intelligence officers and if they were told to keep silent in the face of torture; and full parliamentary accountability - which we do not have in the UK for the intelligence services."
"Mr President, back to body scanners."
"I remain of the view that any measure which increases security for the travelling public must be welcomed."
"However, it must also be proportionate and give innocent travellers - the vast majority - the respect they deserve."
"Following the Christmas Day attempt to blow up the aircraft in the USA, we have seen what amounts to a knee-jerk reaction to impose any possible means to enhance security."
"In some Member States, particularly my own, the use of such machines is now mandatory with no alternative such as a 'pat-down' available - the so-called 'no scan, no fly' tactic."
"I fundamentally object to that policy."
"On the privacy front, I have to say that the decision by the UK Government to overturn child-protection laws in order to introduce body scanners is nothing short of a scandal."
"We have to look at the fact that on Christmas Day - the issue that reopened this debate - it was not down to poor security at airports."
"It was, to quote the US President, 'a failure in the system to properly exchange intelligence'."
"Some experts have already said that the explosives used would not have been detected by such scanners."
"Finally, I regrettably have to say that I now think we need to have a proper system of passenger profiling."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, terrorism is continually evolving and we must stay on top of the changing scenario."
"Individual terrorists are difficult to identify and here we are discussing privacy laws and whether or not to adopt technologically more advanced measures."
"I believe that instead, we should be more concerned with certain judgments handed down by the Court of Justice in Luxembourg that open up breaches in the united front of the West against terrorism, or to refer to it by its proper name - Islamic terrorism - and be very careful of legal political correctness."
"Legal political correctness is no good to anyone, it does not get us anywhere and it weakens us when we should be presenting a very strong front, because a persistent threat exists that is even more serious now that terrorists are so difficult to identify."
"So much for body scanners."
"They can get everywhere: tomorrow morning, they may be on the plane we are just about to take."
"If Europe persists in over-guaranteeing civil liberties, we will open up an extremely dangerous breach in the internal security of our nations and this is what the Commissioner should be concerned with."
"Instead, I find him to be over-general and cowardly by failing to identify Islamic terrorism and the danger it represents by name."
"(DE) Mr President, throughout the world 1 200 people died as a result of terrorist attacks in 2000."
"Eight years later, in 2008, the figure had reached 16 000 people."
"In comparison, 6 000 people die of AIDS every day."
"What do these figures tell us?"
"Firstly, terrorism generates hysteria which results in the rights of citizens being restricted unreasonably, as in the case of body scanners or the current SWIFT agreement."
"Secondly, the war on terror has failed."
"It has only succeeded in increasing the problem."
"On the subject of cooperation between the security services in the European Union, I would like to say that the European Parliament urgently needs democratic rights of control in this area, as is the norm in every democratic Member State."
"In addition, I would like to recommend that the Commission supports the introduction of the Common Standardised User Interface (CSUI)."
"We must push forward with the development of this interface and it must be financed by the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, when dealing with a topic as serious as terrorism, we should not wait for things to happen before we act."
"We should anticipate events, but we do not."
"Unfortunately, we only change in response to each attack, such as the failed attack in Detroit, which is forcing us today to take decisions to ensure the safety of air transport."
"Taking a decision on body scanners in airports is a responsibility that we cannot avoid, ladies and gentlemen."
"We cannot wait any longer because the terrorists are not waiting."
"Consequently, the Commission must guarantee, as soon as possible, that the dignity and privacy of individuals will be preserved and that there will be no harmful effects on health."
"Once this is guaranteed, we must adopt decisions for the European Union as a whole."
"To those who are worried about infringement of our fundamental rights, I say that there is no greater right than the right to life, and those of us who cherish freedom above all else must be able to live safely in order to feel truly free."
"(ES) Mr President, terrorism is a global threat and tackling it is a responsibility that we all share."
"In this regard, too, the Lisbon Treaty lays the foundations for us to be able to finally develop a common anti-terrorism policy in the European Union."
"I agree entirely with the comments of the President-in-Office of the Council and would like to highlight some of the elements on which such a common policy must be built."
"The first is to step up the exchange of information, particularly in relation to the efforts to prevent terrorist attacks and research into funding mechanisms."
"The second is to apply all of the scientific and technological advances that have been achieved to the fight against terrorism, with due respect for individuals' fundamental rights."
"The third is to work with third countries, especially Afghanistan, Pakistan and the countries of the Horn of Africa."
"Fourthly, in the debate on air safety we must ensure that technological advances, namely body scanners, are compatible with human health and privacy and, above all, that they do not affect processing times in airports or passenger comfort."
"However, there are also three institutional elements."
"The first is COSI, the Standing Committee on Internal Security."
"The second is the declaration on counter-terrorism measures issued at the last informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council of the European Union in Toledo."
"The third is the transatlantic area of security, which must provide for the development of close cooperation with the United States to combat this common threat."
"(FR) Mr President, one of the means of preventing terrorism is information."
"Even then, information needs to circulate."
"Is this really the case today?"
"Nothing is less certain."
"Do the US intelligence services keep their European counterparts up to date?"
"In any event, as far as the alleged terrorist arrested on the Amsterdam-Detroit flight is concerned, there is still cause for doubt."
"Apart from this incident, there is the issue of knowing whether, generally speaking, the system for exchanging counterterrorism data really does observe the principle of reciprocity."
"A parliamentary supervisory body on the matter is urgently required."
"In fact, there is no need to call on our Parliament to support the transfer of more and more of our citizens' personal data if, by contrast, the US authorities deprive our services of essential counterterrorism data."
"This entails the creation of a parliamentary supervisory committee within the European Parliament."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit that when we talk about the fight against terrorism only in terms of intelligence and technology, I always feel as though we are still not getting to the bottom of things, as though we wanted to cure a disease by only concentrating on its symptoms and not on its causes."
"Has the time not come to tackle the problem of terrorism by looking at the heart of the matter instead of limiting ourselves to its external effects?"
"Tackling the heart of the problem means, for example, becoming aware that terrorism is also a direct manifestation of the inability or lack of will of ethnic groups to integrate within the fabric of society in Europe."
"I wonder, and I ask Parliament: do we want a debate on terrorism?"
"Does Parliament have the courage to face up to a political debate on the level of integration of Muslims in Europe and their willingness to share Western values, rights and freedoms?"
"To this end I have tabled a question to the Commission on the burkha to prompt this House to face up to the topic openly."
"It seems that no one is willing to deal with the subject."
"I wonder, and I ask you, ladies and gentlemen from all the political groups: if the political forum representing the people of Europe cannot express an opinion about these subjects, what can they express an opinion on?"
"Mr President, as a representative of Northern Ireland, I know only too well the terrible impact of terrorism on innocent civilians: murder and mayhem inflicted while people were doing their Saturday shopping in the Shankhill Road in Belfast; young and old blown up at an act of remembrance to the fallen of the world wars in Enniskillen - acts carried out in the name of Irish Republicanism."
"We talk here about the cooperation of the security forces."
"From the experience of Northern Ireland, we can see that their contributions prevented many people from losing their lives; of that I have no doubt."
"We need to support our security forces with the equipment they need to prevent terrorism."
"Those today who have pitted safety and security against freedom of choice and data protection need to consider where they stand."
"Believe me, terrorism destroys lives and shatters communities."
"I have even heard in this Chamber today that terrorism is hysteria."
"What utter nonsense!"
"Believe me, when a gunman is trying to take a life, it is a cold and lethal reality - something that my constituents know a lot about."
"(PT) Mr President, I believe that we all agree with the need to protect people and goods and ensure security on public transport."
"There are legitimate concerns about body scanners."
"I hope that three of them will be resolved by the studies that the Commission is carrying out."
"I ask that they conclude them promptly and refer them to Parliament."
"Firstly, is it necessary and effective?"
"Secondly, is it or is it not harmful to health?"
"Thirdly, does it or does it not violate the privacy and dignity of individuals?"
"There are, however, other concerns."
"Initially we were told that it would be optional."
"People could choose between submitting themselves to the scanners or to the old system of a personal check."
"It seems, however, that certain Member States are implementing the 'no check, no fly' principle as obligatory."
"I would like to congratulate Commissioner Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m on the comprehensive assessment which she is going to discuss with Parliament, and I would like to stress that we have a responsibility to find solutions which promote security without compromising the rights of individuals."
"(FR) Mr President, we all want to combat terrorism and the threat that it poses to democracies; there is, I believe, agreement on that point within our Parliament."
"While the adage that 'a people that is ready to sacrifice a little freedom for a little security ends up losing both' seems completely over the top to me, I am nevertheless convinced that we must do everything we can to find a balance between freedom and security, because this is the foundation of democracy and because, without that balance, the terrorists will have won if they succeed in terrorising us all."
"I have two questions concerning body scanners."
"In terms of security, do these scanners make it possible today to really guarantee security conditions?"
"In terms of freedom, as a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I wonder whether there is not a risk to health and, of course, a risk with regard to infringements of personal privacy, and therefore of fundamental rights, and with regard to the use of these images."
"Let us wait determinedly for the Commission's work so that we can make progress and so that we can do so as a European Union, all together, in order to ensure our security in a European democratic area."
"Due to lack of time, I cannot accept any more interventions under the 'blue card' or 'catch-the-eye' procedure."
"Mr President, terrorism is defined as the use of violence and intimidation to achieve political ends."
"Those of us who value peace, freedom and democracy ought to be concerned about terrorism because it works."
"Sinn FÃ©in/IRA now hold posts in the government of Northern Ireland."
"They bombed, shot and murdered their way to success at the ballot box."
"What better examples of successful terrorism are there than those of Communism in Russia, Eastern Europe and Asia?"
"China is still terrorised by the Chinese Communist Party after 61 years of power."
"No greater example of successful terrorism exists than that."
"The European Commission which this Parliament voted in yesterday contains Communists, former apparatchiks of brutal Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and their fellow travellers."
"And, of course, the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, is a former Maoist."
"No doubt future terrorists will find this all extremely encouraging."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the security of our societies is a non-negotiable value that we must pursue with determination."
"It is very clear that more efficient checks at the security gates must be backed by a higher level of cooperation between intelligence systems and the use of high-tech instruments."
"The European ministers have done well not to be carried away by a tide of emotion and instead to concentrate on how to go about coordinating this operation."
"Some governments have legitimately started to test body scanners on more sensitive routes."
"Unless we are to end up with a European space that applies non-uniform standards, however, we must obtain the results of the studies under way as soon as possible."
"Of course we must defend personal rights, but without preying on people's fears."
"Let us talk about health, let us reaffirm the precautionary principle, let us ask for confirmation of possible harm resulting from exposure to radio waves or x-rays, but let us stop wailing about an invasion of privacy just because of a few blurred images of faceless bodies that are immediately deleted, as though GPS, mobile phones or TV cameras had not been part of our lives for years."
"Until the international terror centres have been obliterated, we must learn to live with these sacrifices, giving citizens solid answers and effective solutions, with a single limitation: the physical integrity of the individual."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we now come to catch-the-eye."
"These are the names I will call out."
"I will simply stop the microphone after one minute."
"I will not bang my gavel, I will not beg and I do not want to be misunderstood."
"I shall call the speakers in the order that I have:"
"Mr Zasada"
"Mr Iacolino"
"Mr Matula"
"Mr Leichtfried"
"Mr Enciu"
"Ms FlaÅ¡Ã­kovÃ¡ BeÅovÃ¡"
"Mr Tannock"
"Ms Ernst"
"Ms Rivasi"
"and Mr MÃ¶lzer."
"One minute each, and that is it."
"Apologies to the rest of you."
"(PL) Mr President, in the light of today's debate, the use of body scanners at airports still leaves many questions unanswered."
"The safety of travellers is, of course, paramount, but we should not forget the need for a sense of proportion in the protective methods used."
"Use of this type of equipment still leaves a series of unanswered questions."
"What effect do the scanners have on the health of passengers who are scanned?"
"How will protection of the images of people who are scanned be guaranteed?"
"Is it not better to tighten up the existing system than spend billions of euros on equipment, when it is known that the equipment does not detect explosives concealed inside the human body?"
"We should be against the compulsory introduction of scanners at European airports until we have heard answers to these questions."
"Finally, I have a comment - I have the impression that we have found a solution, and now we are looking for a problem for it to solve."
"It may be that scanners are a solution, but they certainly will not solve the problem of security at airports."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in essence I wanted to state the following: there is no problem as serious as that of personal rights and the protection of privacy when this right is not adequately safeguarded."
"If we adopted the resolution on the Stockholm Programme a few weeks ago in this very Parliament, it is because we achieved a balance between different needs: firstly, that of individual freedom, secondly, that of privacy and thirdly, that of security."
"If today we are concerned with ensuring that the European Union deals with this common problem, because the Member States have gone ahead, it is probably because a significant challenge, such as that of protecting crossing points, and other matters besides, may not necessarily be met in practice."
"I therefore call on the Spanish Presidency and the Commissioners to cooperate with one another on the basis of enhanced cooperation and a culture of information."
"(RO) I would like to clarify right at the start of my speech that through this debate we are not only confirming the existence of the risk of terrorism, but we are also highlighting the need to be one step ahead in the battle against this phenomenon."
"However, the debate on the introduction of body scanners at airports in all of the European Union's Member States has wider ramifications."
"The effectiveness of this measure is debatable due to the fact that this technology cannot detect substances which have been ingested or are explosive in powder form."
"However, it also poses for us the problem of safety with regard to passengers' health, especially of those who frequently pass through these screening devices."
"We cannot ignore either the issue of citizens' fundamental rights, the right to privacy and dignity, as long as the scanners provide a detailed image of the human body."
"In my view, independent studies need to be carried out to determine not only the safety of the technology being used, but also the effectiveness ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, the one principle that applies to the security of air travel is that European responsibility is constantly increasing."
"It is no longer possible for individual Member States to do what they want."
"This applies in particular to body scanners."
"We have the one-stop security principle, which means that there must either be European regulations for body scanners or no regulations and no body scanners."
"The alternative is the principle that everyone does what they want and no one does what they should, but everyone does something."
"If a measure of this kind is to be introduced, we must discuss who will pay for it and how it will be financed, because both liquid scanners and body scanners cost huge amounts of money."
"I happen to be the rapporteur for this area and I would be pleased to see the Council gradually starting to move on this issue, because it is important to establish in principle that public security is a public matter and must be financed at least in part from public funds."
"(RO) I would like to draw the attention of the Commission, the Council and my fellow Members to the side-effects and increased risk of carcinogenic conditions and genetic mutations following repeated exposure to gamma, X and T radiation."
"The effects and risks of radiation from X-rays are well known in medicine where repeated exposure to this kind of radiation is not recommended."
"The public are less aware of the effects of terahertz radiation."
"Apart from the fact that T-ray scanners can generate accurate 3D images of the human body, which contravenes the individual's right to privacy, repeated exposure to this kind of radiation may induce lesions in the DNA chains and cause genetic abnormalities to appear later on."
"I would like to stress that the risks and distress which we could be exposed to if body scanners were possibly used on a large scale, along with the uncertainty about their effectiveness, do not justify such a solution ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) Terrorism has no values, nor does it have any deeper meaning."
"The only aim of terrorism is death."
"Death of civilians at the lowest possible cost."
"This is perhaps the story of various suicide attackers."
"It is also a sad fact in respect of this aim that terrorism has led us to introduce various measures focused on protecting the civilian population using methods which in some ways curtail the rights of the civilian population."
"It would therefore be a very good thing if this plenary sometimes approved scanners and if we could begin to think about adopting legislation and harmonisation in the area of justice and in the area of home affairs, because only the adoption of new technological measures will really assist us in the fight against terrorism."
"Mr President, the recent announcement of compulsory back-scatter X-ray technology whole-body scanners at British airports by Prime Minister Gordon Brown is an outrage, in my view."
"This is the first time ever that ionising radiation is being forced on people, including children and pregnant women, and indeed being used widely on healthy humans for non-medical reasons."
"Soft low-energy X-rays actually are more absorbed than the higher-energy cosmic rays you receive whilst flying and are thus more dangerous and not less dangerous to the skin and soft tissues."
"Furthermore, diagnostic medical X-rays allow the user, the patient, the possibility of a lead shielding on their gonads to reduce the total population dose causing DNA damage and future genetic mutations - not possible with these devices either."
"As a doctor and frequent air traveller, I totally reject this draconian measure for health reasons, not to mention privacy and ineffectiveness reasons, and I hope that the EU refuses such mandatory measures Europe-wide."
"Instead, I argue we should bring on Israeli-style profiling of passengers."
"(DE) Mr President, it is absolutely indisputable that body scanners quite clearly represent an invasion of privacy and a serious invasion at that."
"We need to ask ourselves two questions."
"The first question concerns the extent to which this response is proportionate and can really help to achieve the objective of combating terrorism."
"We do not currently have any clear answers to this question."
"This is why I support what Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m has said concerning the need for an evaluation of all types of scanners."
"I would like to see this assessment completed before we do anything else."
"The second question concerns the risks to health."
"Everyone in this room and also those Members who are currently elsewhere will have to pass through body scanners several times each week."
"I would have to do so at least twice a week."
"This is a long-term measure and I would like to know to what extent it will harm my health."
"No real assessments have been carried out in this area."
"I would like to make it quite clear that I am not prepared to expose myself to body scanners until these assessments have been made."
"Therefore, I am calling for clear answers and not for hasty reactions."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to make the connection between the scanner, health and terrorism."
"What does the Interagency Committee on Radioprotection, which brings together the European Commission, the IAEA - the International Atomic Energy Agency - and the Nuclear Energy Agency say?"
"It says that pregnant women and children must not be subjected to body scans, even if the doses are extremely small."
"Indeed, we should be aware that frequent exposure to low doses of radiation can cause cancers and malformations."
"My question therefore concerns justification of the risks."
"Given the existence of alternative technologies that enable the same goals to be achieved, these scanners really do need to be justified in relation to the given objective, and we need to know ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, we must not forget that misinformation and poor decisions made by the US secret service have repeatedly made it possible for acts of international terrorism to happen."
"Despite this, the usefulness of the various anti-terrorism measures has never been called into question."
"Instead, every attack is followed by further restrictions on civil rights and liberties."
"The European Parliament is only waking up to this now that EU citizens are being obliged to undress both literally and financially in front of the US."
"The transparent citizen is increasingly becoming a reality and all of this is based on data and information from the secret services whose role and reliability have become highly controversial, not least since the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq."
"In addition to the doubts about the benefits, feasibility and compatibility with personal rights of body scanners, it seems highly unlikely that they will divert radical Islamists from their terrorist intentions."
"We must take consistent measures to combat Islamist terrorism, but we must put a stop to EU citizens constantly ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the speeches by all the groups and Members on this topic."
"We have heard some extremely interesting views, and I welcome them."
"I would like to remind you, as I did in my first speech, that I am certainly not in favour of holding debates on such a complex and sensitive topic as the fight against terrorism after attacks or apparent attacks."
"We obviously need to examine these attacks or apparent attacks to find out what went wrong with our security systems, but there is no doubt, as has been said time and again here this afternoon, that the counter-terrorism policy must be a carefully thought-out, calm and deliberate policy and must be applied in a proportional manner."
"If we adopt measures that will undermine our principles, we are probably making a serious mistake."
"As a result, we need to analyse, for example, what happened in Detroit to try to prevent mistakes, but we must not respond with a knee-jerk reaction after every attack because this would probably result in us adopting measures that, in some cases, would simply not make sense."
"Europe has a strategy for its counter-terrorism policy."
"We have a good strategy for fighting terrorism in the European Union, one that has proven to be effective in recent years."
"We only have to look at the actions of the security forces in the different countries to see the extent to which, on many occasions, those actions were based on application of the common strategy we introduced a number of years ago."
"We have an important figure, a Counter-Terrorism Coordinator, whose speeches are very interesting."
"Once again, I would recommend that you look in detail at his last speech in this House because I believe it is an excellent speech that highlights the extent of our strategy."
"Indeed, we have recently been trying to give concrete expression to this strategy through prevention, unlike the early years of its application, when we put much more emphasis on detection."
"Of course, the most important element in the fight against terrorism is prevention, in other words, preventing attacks."
"That is why we are focusing our common efforts, as I said, on prevention."
"That is also why we are concentrating on aspects such as radicalisation, which I mentioned in my speech, as did the Commissioner."
"We are keen to analyse the policies being implemented in each country to prevent radicalisation, which is undoubtedly the root cause of many of the terrorist attacks we have suffered in recent years."
"We are also keen to ensure the correct exchange of information."
"This has been emphasised in the House on various occasions."
"The important thing is not to transmit all of the information that you have, but to transmit the information that is relevant to those who are receiving it."
"That is the information that needs to be transmitted."
"The aim is not to swamp ourselves with information, but to have information management tools that make the exchange as effective as possible."
"There have been significant improvements recently in the European Union in that regard."
"We have a strategy that, when implemented, will, for example, improve the functioning of our exchange systems."
"When I talk about exchange, I am thinking of Europol, I am thinking of Eurojust, I am thinking of COSI, which has been mentioned here by some Members, and, lastly, I am thinking of the exchange of information and how to make it more effective."
"Finally, yes, the controversial body scanners are now on the agenda, and I believe, as I said in my first speech and as the Commissioners said, too, that it is an issue that we have to tackle."
"Ideally, we will be able to decide on a common solution at European level."
"Of course, if we do not, each country will be able to implement its own policies, and probably, even if we do decide on a common solution, there may be some countries that decide to go ahead with their own policies under their own laws."
"However, there is little doubt that a common position on this matter would be extraordinarily helpful."
"In order to adopt such a position, and in line with what I said at the start of this speech, we need a calm and deliberate debate focusing on three elements that are currently being studied by the Commission: firstly, the effectiveness of the scanners (whether or not they are effective, what their limits are and whether or not they can do what we want them to do); secondly, their compatibility with fundamental rights and individual freedoms; and thirdly, their compatibility with the health of the people who will have to pass through them."
"I believe these are the three topics that we need to examine."
"Once the reports are available, we will adopt a common position, which I believe is necessary."
"Mr President, I would like to say once again how much I appreciate the speeches made here in the House, which I consider to be extremely useful for the Council's work."
"Mr President, I asked a direct question to the Council and I would like an answer."
"I asked what the Council thought of the gross breach of Article 6 - the fundamental rights clause - of the EU Treaty in light of the UK Court of Appeals' ruling confirming that the UK was guilty ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your contributions, but I must say that we have not got a proposal today to introduce some new machines in a compulsory manner in all Member States and all airports."
"This is not the case."
"We are just in a process of careful examination of these new technologies and we will come to you after April, after a substantial report which will examine all aspects of these new technologies."
"I myself have certain doubts, especially about efficiency and, as somebody said here, the proportionality of using this new technology, but we should not reject outright new technologies."
"Terrorism develops and we, too, must use all technological developments to defend our citizens and passengers."
"So do not demonise new technologies."
"We will, together with colleagues Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m and Viviane Reding, propose a common European approach with all necessary requirements concerning all technological, legal, fundamental rights and privacy issues and aspects."
"We definitely will propose some common European approach, an approach on which I believe there is consensual understanding and which is preferred here and, I understand, also in many Member States."
"So this is what we will do in the near future."
"We will come with a report and then we will continue this discussion."
"Believe me, we do not have any conspiracy to introduce some kind of new machines immediately; there is no technological solution which is totally bullet-proof or which guarantees 100% security, and aviation security is an especially complex area where we need a large variety of combined measures and also very strong international cooperation."
"So after this report, we will come with concrete proposals and we will definitely propose a common European approach on what the standards might be and what the requirements might be if Member States opt for the introduction or use of new screening technologies."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this is indeed an extremely important debate."
"Counter-terrorism is an important tool for fighting terrorism."
"We have painful experiences within the European Union of the effects of terrorism and the threat that it presents, not only to individuals but to societies, democracy and our fundamental values."
"Member States, of course, have the operational responsibility and the responsibility for their intelligence, but I am convinced that we can do much more at European level to coordinate and to fine-tune the tools that we have."
"That is why I have asked my services to, very quickly, carry out an analysis of the policies, of the framework, of the tools that we already have, in order to see what can be improved and how we can use them in an even more intelligent way."
"I agree with certain Members who have said that."
"I am also convinced that Europol, Eurojust and Member State authorities can work much better and in a much more coordinated way."
"There are certainly measures for doing that."
"Events like the one in Detroit are important as they serve as a kind of alarm bell, alerting us to the fact that terrorism is still present; it is still a very important threat."
"There are demands and pressure on us politicians to do things quickly, to introduce improvements and to protect the citizens immediately."
"This is totally natural."
"We have a responsibility to protect security, but also to act after thorough analysis, assessment and discussion so we propose appropriate and proportional measures, as Commissioner Siim Kallas and as the Council have also said."
"We will do this."
"We will also have to give full consideration to respect for fundamental rights."
"So this is how this Commission will work."
"We will come back to you with more detailed proposals after this evaluation has been carried out and discuss this further with you."
"Thank you very much for an important and very engaging debate."
"The debate is closed."
"(ES) Mr President, before we finish, I would simply like to make a point of order and express my surprise, because when the catch-the-eye procedure began, I raised my hand, thinking that it was starting then, but you already had a full list."
"I would simply like the catch-the-eye criteria to be standardised so that we can all speak, because there seemed to be other Members speaking even though you said you had a full list."
"I therefore just want to express my surprise and request that for the next time, we all know what we have to do to be able to speak."
"Terrorism remains a high-level threat in the European Union."
"This is why all Member States have stepped up their efforts to improve the tools used to prevent and combat it."
"The adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon offers the opportunity to respond much more efficiently in every area linked, directly or indirectly, to combating terrorism."
"The use of body scanners is a delicate issue."
"I think that there are important factors which must be examined carefully before making a decision on this."
"They concern the scanners' effectiveness, respect for the right to privacy, the financial impact of using them given the particularly high cost of buying them and, above all, the way in which the use of these machines affects the health of those who are screened by them."
"The European Commission is due to produce three studies on the use and effects of body scanners."
"For this reason, I believe that it is important for us to await the experts' conclusions and closely analyse them and only then make a decision on a common position on this issue."
"in writing. - When the issue of counter-terrorism measures arises, the debate always focuses on the affect on civil liberties."
"I have always taken the stand that it is a question of priorities."
"It is a question whether passengers are prepared to sacrifice their discomfort for their safety."
"Civil liberty groups have the duty to weigh all new measures being advocated."
"Those proposing new measures such as body scanners have the duty to prove their necessity."
"Although solutions are normally based on compromise, in this instance, compromises may not be possible."
"It is apparent that current procedures, in particular, body searches, are not sufficient."
"It has been established that body scanners are more effective."
"The problem is that they may offend passengers' dignity."
"Therefore, this is the issue which has to be addressed."
"Many possibilities exist."
"For instance, different body scanners for different genders manned by personnel of the same gender."
"Ensuring the security of air travel in the fight against terrorism is without doubt essential, but we must ascertain what impact the measures created to ensure this security have on our health, fundamental rights and freedoms, privacy and dignity."
"The use of body scanners, as one of the possible technical solutions, is a very serious matter, concerning the use of new technologies for the security of citizens, and therefore I hope that the Commission will finally present an assessment of the impact of body scanners on people's health and fundamental human rights and freedoms."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that while using new technical measures, which are aimed at achieving a high level of airport security, it is also very important to set boundaries between human rights and security itself, as those measures are not only related to the protection of citizens, but to the impact on their rights and freedoms."
"The Commission has yet to present an impact assessment report, confirming that precisely body scanners will ensure the effective protection of people travelling by air, and therefore there are still doubts as to whether these technical security measures will really be safe, effective and sound."
"Therefore, once we have evaluated the existing situation, we must continue our work in this sensitive area."
"in writing. - The European Parliament cannot give its consent to the introduction of body scanners, which are essentially a type of X-ray, before the existing health and privacy concerns surrounding them have been properly addressed by European authorities."
"I am aware that concerns exist among frequent flyers and I am concerned about subjecting other passengers, such as pregnant women and children, to body scanners."
"There are also considerable concerns regarding the intrusive nature of these images, and we must ensure that the privacy of European citizens is protected before we agree to the widespread distribution of these time-consuming and expensive machines."
"Given that the American authorities have conceded that it was a failure on the part of their security agencies rather than airport technology which led to the recent Detroit terrorist scare, I believe that, before we invest in this controversial technology, a variety of less expensive methods - such as increased intelligence, different search methods and enhanced international cooperation - should be explored."
"The American founding father Benjamin Franklin once said that 'He who would put security so far before liberty deserves neither', and I believe that Europe would do well to heed this particular piece of advice over the coming months."
"in writing. - The International Federation of journalists, representing 600 000 journalists in 125 countries, has called on the Israeli Authorities to revoke a deportation order on journalist Jared Malsin who was deported because his reports on the situation in the West Bank and Gaza were critical of the Israeli Government."
"They have condemned the deportation of as an intolerable violation of press freedom."
"In addition, 13 Israeli Human Rights Organisations have protested to the Israeli Knesset and Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding the increasingly systematic campaign against Human Rights Organisations in Israel."
"It has been reported that Israel is now demanding that the European Union stop giving financial assistance to Human Rights Organisations operating in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories."
"I wish to ask you Mr President to make contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu to make it clear that the EU is founded on respect for the right of free speech, the right to criticise one's own government, a free press, and the right to peaceful protest, as fundamental to a democratic state."
"Prime Minister Netanyahu must also be reminded that EU trade agreements require those we do business with to respect those rights."
"Nearly 10 years after 11 September, the terrorist threat is still present, and aeroplanes are one of the tools favoured by terrorists to strike at our countries."
"We must find a way of protecting our citizens and preventing them from becoming the victims of terrorist acts."
"Body scanners may be one of the ways of strengthening security in airports and on board aeroplanes."
"Before taking a decision, however, we must make sure that these machines do not infringe individual liberties and that they are not harmful to the health of travellers or of airport staff."
"I await with great interest the study that the European Commission will submit on this matter in March."
"In dealing with all the different aspects associated with their use, this report should make it possible to certify the scanners throughout Europe, guaranteeing the protection of civil liberties and health while improving security."
"In order that all citizens should benefit from the same protection, I hope that, following the submission of this study by the European Commission, we shall encourage Member States to come to an agreement on this matter."
"in writing. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the toolset of security measures used in international airports is continually expanded as aviation safety - our safety - faces more and more challenges."
"At the same time, a number of elements of measures already taken, planned or tested to improve aviation safety already exceed the strictly aeronautical or aviation safety requirements."
"This is why these issues should be investigated in their overall context."
"Safety is a key issue in our lives - it is the most important issue."
"However, we only feel safe when safety measures do not restrict our rights disproportionately, do not violate our personal rights and, in some cases, do not damage our health, and when the measures taken to ensure our safety, as a whole, are not disproportionate, cannot be circumvented and have an appropriate level of efficiency."
"We need devices, such as body scanners, which provide efficient passenger traffic monitoring, are used on the basis of voluntary consent, taking into account, among other things, passengers who have essential medical implants (electronic pacemakers or metal implants), are not harmful to health, children, pregnant women or frequent travellers, and finally, do not record image data and are used only to provide an appropriate warning in the event of a risk."
"Therefore, any further debate on the introduction of test scanners is only useful when sufficiently detailed impact assessments of the conditions listed above have been carried out."
"Only the use of devices compliant with this set of requirements is acceptable to us."
"in writing. - We cannot wait for another catastrophe before acting to protect air passengers."
"Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has tendered a contract, worth up to EUR 2 million, for body scanners at Dublin airport."
"The DAA said that, if the Department of Transport gives the go-ahead, which seems very likely, and the equipment proved successful, the scanners could be extended to Cork and Shannon airports."
"But the Data Protection Commissioner is concerned that any moves by the Irish authorities to bring in scanners goes through proper consideration and balances security needs with individual privacy rights."
"Manchester Airport, where one of the scanners is being trialled, insists the black and white images are not pornographic or erotic and are viewed by a single officer at a remote location after which they are immediately destroyed."
"Body scanners are not infallible but they are the best technology available at present and so we need to use what tools we have to hand in order to reduce the terrorist threat."
"We need a pan-European approach to the issue of scanners - airport security needs to be uniform."
"I eagerly await the conclusion of the Commission report of the impact of body scanners."
"Ladies and gentlemen, listening to today's debate, one might have the impression that the main problem currently facing European countries is whether to increase the use of body scanners at airports or to limit possibilities for their introduction."
"It seems to me that this is not, however, a correct understanding of the matter."
"From this point of view, the problem of guaranteeing protection of human rights is not very significant, either."
"The fundamental question we should ask is whether the new methods and instruments proposed by the special services will be used effectively."
"If we give up part of our liberty in favour of security, will our security really be guaranteed?"
"The information we are receiving about this makes us very sceptical."
"If the appropriate services are not even able to guarantee effective passport control, and if they cannot use the information they possess - which is so clearly shown by the incident with the flight to Detroit - what guarantee do we have that they will be able to use the new instruments effectively?"
"History teaches us that in crisis situations, special services want to take the simplest route."
"They demand new powers, more money and better instruments, while they are not able to use to the full the possibilities they already have."
"Someone should stand up for common sense and healthy scepticism, and it seems to me that the European Parliament has a not insignificant role to play in this regard."
"The events of recent years have forced us to look for new solutions which will ensure the greatest possible security for travellers."
"The terrorist threat has made us agree more readily to the restriction of our own freedom."
"I hope that before a decision is made on the general introduction of body scanners at airports, a thorough analysis will be made of their effectiveness and safety, as well as the costs which will have to be incurred."
"We do not want a repeat of what happened with the mass introduction of vaccines against A1/H1N1 influenza, when governments, in a wave of panic, bought stocks of vaccines at huge cost without receiving a guarantee of their safety from the producers, and now those stocks remain unused."
"Perhaps it would be more effective to use solutions developed by the Israelis, where emphasis is placed on observation of passengers' behaviour and on thorough checking of those who arouse most suspicion, and not of everyone."
"This system has proved its effectiveness over many years."
"It is our duty as MEPs to get involved in resolving the issues raised by the subject of body scanners with regard to both the fight against terrorism and the civil and personal rights of Europeans."
"I totally agree with finding viable solutions for enhancing our citizens' security."
"However, we have an obligation to ensure the protection of all the rights of our fellow citizens across the European Union."
"This implies the right to privacy and the fundamental right to personal dignity, which must be balanced with the security concept of the airport machines."
"The question which arises in this context is whether these body scanners are the most viable solution for resolving the security problems at airports."
"I think that Europe must say YES to finding solutions for combating terrorism and organised crime and NO to infringing the right to privacy and personal dignity, which is a basic principle of democracy."
"in writing. - Every time a real or would-be terrorist boards a plane, fooling the vigilance of our brave security guards and their wonderful machines, millions of passengers get a more miserable life for years to come."
"The 9/11 terrorists have been successful beyond imagination: they managed to alter our lives - for the worse - forever!"
"We, in the East, wanted to get rid of our 'Big Brother' and we got in exchange the 'Western' variant, more sophisticated but no less scary."
"Many 'security guards' at some airports misbehave; they consider themselves above the law, looking at every passenger as a suspect, taking the liberty to inspect every bit of luggage without any explanation and, of course, excuse, when their 'suspicion' proved unfounded."
"And when you dare to protest, they laugh in your face."
"You would agree this is an abuse."
"It is high time, then, that the Commission looked into the activity of these firms and imposed some standards of behaviour towards the large mass of honest citizens."
"After all, we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be respected equally by every European, including those in charge of security in our airports."
"To fight terrorism effectively, we need coordinated action, including EU rules on scanners."
"The principles which we accept must include protection of basic rights and personal data as well as something no less important - citizens' health."
"A decision on compulsory use of scanning equipment must be made."
"There is no point talking about it at all if the scans are to be voluntary."
"For it is difficult to suppose that terrorists will agree to being scanned."
"A very important question is, of course, the safety of the scanners for health."
"Opinions are divided on this, from the opinion of the Czech Office of Nuclear Safety, which shows that scanning equipment emits radiation which is harmful to human health, to that of the French Central Civil Aviation Directorate, which considers the equipment completely safe."
"Further tests are essential to show which types of scanner are safe for health and any possible side effects of their use."
"The research should be coordinated by the European Commission with the full cooperation of Member States."
"The scanners used must have a safety certificate allowing their use in all Member States."
"In this way, we will avoid duplication of research costs by individual Member States, and we will be sure that citizens' health is protected equally in each Member State."
"Mr President, a new method of searching passengers has been introduced at some European airports."
"Alongside the current forms of security, full body scanners have been brought into use."
"Most airline passengers are decidedly against this, seeing in this form of search a violation of fundamental human rights, including the right to intimacy and protection of personal dignity."
"In addition, and this is very significant, this reluctance is deepened by a lack of knowledge about what effect the scanners have on the health of those scanned."
"There are no clear regulations on the storage and protection of data collected by scanning."
"It is also being argued that the scanners are nowhere near as highly effective as is claimed by their producers."
"One would hope that their effectiveness does not turn out to be similar to that of the vaccines against swine influenza, which, in the final analysis, were effective only in increasing the incomes of pharmaceutical concerns."
"Taking into account all these justified doubts, I think the European Commission should specify principles for protecting the rights of passengers which, at the same time, ensure their safety."
"Situation in Ukraine (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission on the situation in Ukraine."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Cathy Ashton, asked me to make the following remarks."
"Allow me to thank you for this very timely invitation to address you on Ukraine, which is a key partner for the European Union."
"As you will be aware, a second round of presidential elections took place on Sunday in Ukraine."
"This was an important event, not just for the country itself, but for the wider region as a whole."
"It is important because a democratic Ukraine will serve as an important example to its neighbours."
"We welcome the positive assessment made by the OSCE/ODIHR-led International Election Observation Mission that the elections were conducted in accordance with international standards and that there has been further progress in Ukraine's already good electoral track-record since 2004."
"The statement issued by the High Representative on Monday expressed this sentiment."
"It also congratulated the people of Ukraine for their continued commitment to the democratic process."
"The high turnout on both election days was particularly encouraging."
"It is clear that Ukraine's democracy is continuing its process of consolidation."
"The population of the country goes to the polls, makes its choice freely, and expects to be heard."
"This is a significant achievement."
"Most importantly, it demonstrates Ukraine's attachment to European values."
"Elections have winners and losers."
"It is the electorate who decides."
"As we meet here today in Strasbourg, official election results have not yet been certified by the Central Election Commission."
"Preliminary election results show a very small gap between the two contestants."
"We have already heard about possible challenges to the results in the courts."
"Some local court cases have already been initiated."
"It is logical and legitimate that any possible problems are investigated."
"At the same time, it is of utmost importance that the electoral process as a whole continues in a smooth manner, demonstrating both the resilience and depth of Ukraine's democratic maturity and the candidates' own shared commitment to the country's development."
"Every election is a demonstration of popular will."
"It is also an opportunity for a new start."
"It is now vital for Ukraine to move forward."
"The success of the electoral process in Ukraine - given Ukraine's geographical and strategic importance - matters to the EU, and to Europe as a whole."
"In the past years, we have seen political instability, characterised by competition between the President and Prime Minister, exacerbated by a lack of clarity in the Constitution."
"Ukraine has consistently held good elections, and has a vibrant civil society and free media."
"Regrettably, however, the overall reform process - which is vital for Ukraine - has significantly slowed."
"Much more should have been done in the past years."
"Pre-election politics also got in the way of the implementation of the IMF standby arrangement, with Ukraine failing to meet required conditions."
"The weakness of Ukraine's constitutional framework has also contributed to this."
"I am convinced that I speak for all of us in saying that we look to the new leadership in Ukraine to give new impetus to its reform efforts."
"As a first priority, in order to address the effects of the global financial crisis and ensure future economic stability, Ukraine needs to get back on track with the IMF programme, without delay."
"This is also a precondition for the disbursement of possible EU macrofinancial assistance."
"In the weeks and months to come, we will see a new administration being formed in Kiev."
"The EU's message to Ukraine's leadership is consistent and clear: now is the time to act."
"We expect to see concrete steps forward."
"Reform is essential for Ukraine's own long-term prosperity and security."
"It is in Ukraine's own interest - not just to please the international community."
"This message was also already conveyed at the EU-Ukraine Summit of 4 December 2009."
"Action is needed at many levels."
"On the economic front, Ukraine needs to take urgent action to tackle corruption and to improve the business and investment climate."
"This includes efforts to strengthen the independence of the judiciary, to open up the economy and to ensure fair and transparent competition - for example, by the adoption of a public procurement law in line with international standards and the European Union acquis."
"At the same time, essential sectoral reforms in areas such as energy - in particular the gas sector - transport and the environment need to be undertaken and implemented."
"We have also consistently encouraged Ukraine to revisit constitutional reform, to bring stability and put in place functioning ground rules for political life."
"A constitution needs to stand the test of time, and its reform should not be tied to short-term political considerations."
"It is up to Ukraine to choose the model it wants to adopt."
"However, it should ensure that an effective system of checks and balances is in place which avoids the political paralysis that Ukraine has experienced in the past."
"The help and advice of the Venice Commission will be important in ensuring that this is done in a manner corresponding to European standards, availing of the best experience available."
"Over and above the first reform priorities, Ukraine needs to continue the extensive task of ensuring regulatory approximation with European Union standards."
"This is a prerequisite to ensure that Ukraine can enjoy the full benefits of the new and ambitious EU-Ukraine association agreement which we are currently negotiating with Ukraine - including a deep and comprehensive free trade area,"
"It is our task to encourage Ukraine on the way forward and to support Kiev's own leadership in a process of far-reaching reforms and modernisation."
"We have many tools to do so."
"Through the European neighbourhood policy, we have the means to support Ukraine's own reform efforts."
"Already today, ongoing and planned technical and financial cooperation with Ukraine is in the region of EUR 435 million, without counting possible macrofinancial assistance."
"The Eastern Partnership has brought additional tools."
"The comprehensive institution-building programme envisaged by the Eastern Partnership is a case in point, as it specifically targets institutions within the Ukrainian Government which need strengthening in order to deliver on reform."
"More generally, in negotiations with Ukraine on a new ambitious EU-Ukraine association agreement, we have set out our goals clearly: political association and economic integration between the European Union and Ukraine."
"This is a very significant undertaking, including the establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area involving extensive regulatory approximation to the European Union acquis."
"But our offer to Ukraine is not a one-way street."
"The pace at which Ukraine and the EU come closer together in the future depends on the quality and depth of Ukraine's own reform efforts."
"We look forward to working with Ukraine's new leadership to achieve our common goals."
"We have been in contact today through our cabinets with the High Representative and my colleague in the Commission, and let me summarise the three following messages: firstly, we both agreed that these elections testified the vibrancy of democracy in Ukraine; secondly, we are committed to deepening the relationship with Ukraine and supporting it in implementing its reform agenda; and, thirdly, we look forward to starting a constructive cooperation with the President-elect as soon as official results are announced."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are rather disappointed."
"I am one of the people who was in the tent city during the Orange Revolution in Kiev and when I look at what has been done over the past five years, I want to say to President Yushchenko that he has not brought stability to his country, he has not created parliamentary opportunities and he has brought the legislative process to a halt."
"He is certainly responsible for the failure of the Orange Revolution."
"I hope that these elections will bring new stability to Ukraine."
"However, despite the elections apparently being conducted in accordance with international standards, I am concerned that this is not a stable, self-confident democracy."
"When the legislation is amended three days before the second ballot, right in the middle of the elections, for whatever purpose, this does not demonstrate that the process has been understood."
"Instead, it causes us to watch Ukraine with great concern."
"I believe that we must become closely involved in the issue of the development of democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine, together with the related subject of stability, which is not a contradiction, but a consequence of this."
"Mr FÃ¼le, you have a specific responsibility relating to neighbourhood policy."
"However, neighbourhood policy does not simply mean going on as before."
"Instead, it means using the tools available to us not only for a bilateral relationship with a country like Ukraine or with other countries in the region, but instead in a multilateral approach to these countries, so that they come closer together and become more stable."
"We must give them perspectives."
"This does not involve referring every day to the enlargement of the European Union, but instead making visa facilities available to them now, considering the possibility of a free trade zone and perhaps even offering them the prospect of the same status as Norway within a European economic area."
"This will not harm anyone, does not represent aggressive behaviour towards anyone and, at the same time, will lead to the introduction of the European perspective and of stability in countries of this kind. I hope that the new government will prove itself worthy of taking part in this type of project."
"Madam President, Commissioner, one of the drawbacks of your being responsible for both enlargement and the neighbourhood policy is that you will spend more time in this Chamber."
"Now to the matter in hand."
"We must say that the international observers gave a very positive assessment of the elections in Ukraine, regardless of the fact that the legislation surrounding the actual elections stood on shaky ground."
"It can be said that the fact that changes were made at the last minute did not directly affect the result of these elections."
"In fact, we can say that democracy in Ukraine was the main winner because, when the current president stands again as a candidate and only receives 5% of the votes, this seems to me to be a very clear sign that democracy is working."
"One of the rules of democracy is that you accept the result of the elections as it is."
"Also, you acknowledge your rival's victory when the assessment of the actual elections is positive."
"This is why our message to the losing candidate must be very clear: Ukraine needs political stability and must be given the opportunity finally to initiate long-delayed reforms."
"Apart from these messages, we must clearly state in this House that we will help Ukraine to start moving forward again through our policy, the Neighbourhood Policy, and the Eastern Partnership."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the recent presidential elections in Ukraine marked the end of the period in recent years in which the colour orange carried a political message."
"The recent presidential elections can be seen as another step in the consolidation of democracy."
"There is a saying that a revolution devours its own children."
"This is true, but Ukraine remains a state even after these elections."
"It still has its multi-party system, and this is mainly thanks to the Orange Revolution."
"Likewise, the existence of freedom of speech and a free press can be attributed to the events of five years ago, when the route towards freedom and respect for human rights was taken."
"And all of this is very important."
"Thus, we have to recognise the development of Ukraine towards democracy and the rule of law, towards improving economic integration and promoting relations with the European Union."
"I believe that, despite the official results of the elections, Ukraine will continue on the same course - it will continue to support integration with the European Union, to make the state government more effective, to make the political system more balanced - and to continue with constitutional reform."
"Ukraine's internal political stability and concentration on internal reform are a precondition for the further continuation of relations between the European Union and Ukraine."
"It is a crucial precondition for bilateral and multilateral cooperation that Ukraine's Government continues to implement its objectives."
"We have to continue talks on the association agreement between Ukraine and the European Union."
"In recent times, the tempo has been slowing, and we must speed it up again."
"We also have to put a more concrete content into energy and environmental cooperation."
"Joining the World Trade Organisation is a significant achievement, which is also an important precondition for creating a proper free trade area for us and Ukraine."
"We also have to mention shortcomings, however: corruption has already been mentioned, and there are entrenched special interest groups and nepotistic practices."
"We hope that Ukraine turns round these shortcomings ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to pick up on what Mr Brok said."
"It is true that it was a very sad result for the hero of 2004, Victor Yushchenko, to be beaten in the first ballot."
"In my view, Mr Yushchenko is the only person to pick up the tab for the failings of all the leaders of the Ukrainian parties or blocks."
"One important issue that we need to deal with is the fact that the people of Ukraine do not really trust any of the heads of the Ukrainian parties to lead their country on behalf of and for the benefit of all its citizens."
"If there is one result that has come out of the presence of the election observers, alongside the fact that the elections were conducted properly, which goes without saying, it is the discovery during the course of many discussions that most people voted for the lesser evil."
"None of the citizens whom I met had great expectations of this election."
"That is alarming in the case of such a young democracy, which has moved further away from the former Soviet system than any other country in Eastern Europe."
"Mr FÃ¼le, I hope that your presence today and the absence of Baroness Ashton does not mean that Ukraine is once again taking second place and will disappear among all the other foreign and security policy priorities."
"It must be one of the major priorities, because this has not been the case during the last five years."
"The internal failings in Ukraine are mirrored by failings in the European strategy."
"We must not take this lightly any longer."
"We must give our unconditional support to Ukraine's focus on the West, because we have a lot to lose."
"Gas is one subject which always causes a great deal of consternation."
"I only need to mention Sevastopol, where we are facing a major conflict."
"We cannot simply let things go on as they have before."
"You have taken on a significant responsibility in this area."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, of course, Yulia Tymoshenko is entitled to appeal against the result of the presidential election."
"Given the intrigues and scheming which went on in 2004, we cannot blame her, except for the fact that this time, international election observers have confirmed the results."
"She can stand up for her supposed rights."
"However, this is not a clever move in political terms, because a dispute of this kind will result in the political and economic uncertainty in the country continuing."
"The close election result reflects the fact that the country is split into two camps."
"However, realistically, it will not be possible for Mr Yanukovich to reinstate the authoritarian regime that was overthrown years ago, even if he wanted to, despite the fact that the oligarchic structure in the political and economic system has undoubtedly been reinforced by the presidential elections."
"Given the close result, both camps will have to make compromises."
"It is important that the cultural and social East-West split within the country is overcome for the sake of the people."
"A lot will depend on whether Mr Yanukovich appoints a prime minister whom both the Eastern and Western Ukrainians can live with and whether Mrs Tymoshenko has the democratic maturity to acknowledge her defeat and join the opposition."
"Madam President, Commissioner, five years ago, this Chamber went through the Orange Revolution, too, in a certain sense."
"However, several weeks ago, including in Mrs Ashton's speech, questions were asked about whether the Ukrainians were ready for the Orange Revolution, and if they had put it all into practice?"
"I share Mrs Harms' regret, here, that Mrs Ashton is not with us today."
"There is an answer to this question: a 70% turnout at an election is, truly, a rarity in Europe, and it is a real rarity in our countries, too."
"In this sense, Mr Brok is not right when he says the Orange Revolution lost."
"It won, because it was all about having rules from which everyone could benefit."
"In Poland, too, we know about situations in which the beneficiary of democratic rules was someone who had formerly been opposed to democracy."
"However, this is good - this is how it should be."
"Now the time has come for our answer: have we done everything we should have done following the Orange Revolution?"
"Have we answered that question?"
"Apart from all the instruments which the Commissioner has spoken about - and it is good that we have created these instruments - have we answered that the door is open for Ukraine?"
"Can far-reaching reforms be carried out in a post-communist country without that promise?"
"Can we encourage people to make sacrifices if we tell them they will always be kept waiting outside?"
"Should we not, rather, tell them: there is room for you in Europe, not today, not tomorrow, but there is room."
"To say that is a great opportunity for the new Commissioner, Mr FÃ¼le."
"Mrs Ashton has not come, today."
"Commissioner, be bold and be the first person who starts to say that there is room."
"Not today, not tomorrow, but there will be room."
"This will be of great help to the Ukrainians."
"This may be the last moment when this can be said, and this is why all Ukrainians must be certain that integration, cooperation with Europe and changes to the law are their own personal opportunity."
"This must not just be said to the elite, to businesspeople or to students."
"It must be said in such a way that everyone will understand that it is still worth making sacrifices after the years of communism, that it is still worth doing something."
"It is an opportunity for you, too, Mr FÃ¼le."
"Say this clearly, and you will go down in history."
"You will help not only Ukraine, but all of Central Europe, because prosperity and security for Ukraine mean an opportunity for the whole of Central Europe."
"Everyone must feel that they have an opportunity."
"This is why, apart from the association agreement, which is very important, we need to relax the visa requirement for Ukrainians and, in the future, lift it."
"We need to say very clearly: the door to Europe is open for Ukraine."
"Someone must, at last, after these five years, say it."
"Madam President, Ukraine's recent elections have shown that the country is a functioning democracy."
"The new President will be governing in the face of robust opposition and free media."
"It is to be hoped that the opposition will be constructive and the standards of governance in the country will improve."
"The election campaign confirmed that the Ukrainian political elite wants to continue the process of integration with the European Union and to maintain good neighbourly relations with Russia."
"The European Union must respond with clear signals welcoming both trends."
"At the same time, Ukraine needs to speed up its reforms."
"If such progress is made, the EU must consider extending a promise of membership to Ukraine."
"In the meantime, we should encourage and do much more for integration at the grassroots level."
"People-to-people exchanges, youth and school visits, scholarships, city and regional twinning arrangements and business contracts are the best way of spreading the message that reforms are the only way to a better future."
"What is most important at this moment is that the EU finds a way of liberalising the entry visa regime."
"We must ensure the greatest possible flow of people across our frontiers with Ukraine."
"As one of my constituents wrote to me recently, help 1 000 people to travel to the EU from eastern Ukraine and 100 000 will hear about their favourable impressions when they return."
"This is the way to underpin the reforms we want to see happening in this valuable democratic neighbours of ours."
"(PL) Madam President, there is at least one country of the former Soviet Union where the results of elections are not known in advance."
"That country is Ukraine, and we should be pleased about this, because we, too, have played our part, here."
"After the elections in Ukraine, something will change."
"There will be a new President, and that new President should meet with a friendly reception in the European Union and the European Parliament."
"This is because Ukraine's European inclinations are not a passing interest, but a serious challenge and the ambition of millions of Ukrainians."
"A new openness to Ukraine is needed from the European Union."
"Let us not be motivated by personal ambitions."
"I do understand that in the European People's Party, there is a little regret that the elections were not won by the woman they wanted to win."
"However, let us not push the new President of Ukraine into the arms of Moscow."
"Ukraine is going to be a partner from whom much will be expected."
"Ukraine is going to be a partner who will be given much to do."
"Ukraine is going to be a partner who should be treated with goodwill."
"Therefore, once again, a new European impulse is needed, because Ukraine is part of Europe, and we must implement this policy in our own interest."
"(RO) I hope that the Ukrainian authorities will step up their efforts to cooperate externally with the European Union and to come into line with European standards internally."
"The Eastern Partnership and Euronest initiative offer a suitable framework for this."
"Regardless of the political hue of the new administration, the question is not whether the Ukraine should remain eastern or become western."
"The question is whether the Ukraine can consolidate democracy internally."
"This means establishing democratic norms and protecting human rights."
"One sensitive area is, for instance, the situation of the Romanian-speaking minority in Ukraine and their right to education in their mother tongue."
"On the foreign policy front, Ukraine must be encouraged towards cooperating with the European Union through developing good neighbourly relations with EU Member States."
"However, it is just as important to involve Ukraine in the European processes for cooperating on the Black Sea region."
"Finally, consolidating relations with the pro-European government in the Republic of Moldova may be an immediate, beneficial step towards a good neighbourhood policy."
"(PT) Five years after the Orange Revolution, the Ukrainians seems to be looking back on the period as a lost opportunity."
"This is not solely the fault of their political elite."
"It is true that they were too consumed with conflicts of power and influence."
"Many reforms were never implemented, and many never left the drawing board."
"In a democracy, it is inconceivable for electoral law to be changed between the two rounds of an election."
"This does no credit to those who proposed them, those who voted for them or those who made them."
"It suggests that there are unworthy and undesirable intentions behind it."
"A lot needs to change with the judicial authorities' lack of independence, as they are subject to too much influence, not only from political powers but also from economic actors."
"Without a free and independent justice system there can be no law, human rights are not guaranteed, and there is no foreign investment or progress."
"However, the blame for this disillusionment can also be laid at the door of this House, and many Member States in particular."
"I wish that for a few seconds, we could put ourselves in the shoes of a citizen of a European country which, due to the vicissitudes of history, is still not a member of the European Union."
"What would we expect from the EU?"
"Solidarity."
"Yet many foreign ministries, with the sole concern of not bothering or upsetting Moscow, have used and abused the permanent infighting in Kiev in order to avoid stating unequivocally that the Ukraine is an independent and sovereign country."
"As such, if the majority of its people freely show themselves to be in favour and it meets the established criteria, Ukraine can aspire to becoming a member of the European Union in the future."
"(LT) Although it is disappointing, we must recognise that the six year romantic period in Ukraine's political life is over."
"The result of Ukraine's presidential elections is neither an accident, nor a 'mistaken' choice by the people of Ukraine."
"Rather, it reflects deeper political problems and the fact that the hopes of the Orange Revolution were not fulfilled."
"Commissioner, you said that we expect energetic and purposeful action from Ukraine's new President and new administration."
"The country needs serious structural reforms."
"However, we should say something to the European Union."
"In this situation, if we want to have influence in the post-Soviet space and consolidate the positions of democracy and human rights in this region, then we must work with Ukraine, and more actively than ever before."
"The European Union must give Ukraine an alternative European vision."
"To do this, we should first of all aim for so-called 'soft' measures that have a long-term impact, such as promoting economic integration, the more active creation of people-to-people contacts and political dialogue with Ukraine's government institutions."
"(HU) In the debate about the current situation in Ukraine, I would like to ask the Commission to use its relations or network of relations with Ukraine to request and show a consistent and clear commitment with regard to the rights of national minorities, alongside other areas, as what we have heard today about recent setbacks in Ukraine, affecting so many areas, applies exponentially to members of minorities, to education in the languages of minorities and to the use of their mother tongue."
"Clarity and consistency is required on our side because the European Union does have the ability to influence Ukraine, which has a neighbourhood policy status, right across the board, including the rules and regulations regarding national minorities."
"We have seen that the consistency of our standpoint and messages does work, and we hope that this may help in finding the appropriate remedies for such issues."
"I propose that any future agreement drafted with Ukraine specifically covers these issues, including the right to mother-tongue education, as this is a fundamental pre-requisite for the survival of national minorities."
"(LT) Today, Ukraine is experiencing not just an economic, but in some senses a political crisis."
"Perhaps these presidential elections will help bring the country out of political stalemate and will provide more stability."
"Ukraine is still deciding which model of civilisation it should subscribe to."
"Should the country cooperate with the east or choose integration in Europe?"
"It is not such an easy choice to make, especially when the ideological division that exists in political life has also spread to society."
"The door to Europe must be left open for Ukraine and transparent elections are an important step strengthening the principles of a democratic state."
"The people of Ukraine have expressed their will to choose the leader of their country."
"Ukraine is a European country which must have the right to take decisions on Europe."
"Therefore, the European Union must cooperate intensively with Ukraine, strengthening democracy in this country and speeding up its integration in the European Union."
"(SL) Commissioner, your report on Ukraine today was very clear."
"Ukraine has the prospect of accession to the EU and we have the instruments to make that prospect a credible option."
"This election was closely fought, but it was a democratic one and, for us, that is the news of the day."
"Basically, the close contest has exposed how complicated this country is."
"Ukraine is a multi-ethnic and a multi-confessional country and one with a very chequered history, which is something we have to take into account."
"I think that we, both the European Parliament and Europe as a whole, should use all means to encourage some sort of productive dialogue within Ukraine, a dialogue that would strengthen the Ukrainian state and society from within."
"Attaching labels to this country or spreading any kind of prejudice about it would be a negative thing."
"I do not think we have done this in the past and I hope we will not do so in the future, either."
"Madam President, on Sunday, I had the privilege to be present in Kiev as an observer for the ECR Group."
"Everything I saw was peaceful, transparent and - in many ways, curiously - more robust than in my own country, the UK, with transparent ballot boxes and photo ID required in order to allow you to vote."
"However, I was, of course, disappointed by the result, because President Yanukovich is no Western-style democrat."
"He will now formally drop all NATO aspirations and pay only lip-service to EU membership for his country which, of course, is now also formally opposed by Russia, his close friend and neighbour."
"He will content himself, instead, with an FTA and a visa liberalisation regime."
"Mrs Tymoshenko is clutching at straws, in my view, by challenging the result of her narrow defeat in the courts and I doubt very much this will succeed."
"The one real concern I have now is what I heard being discussed on the night: renewed splittist tendencies to break off the Ukrainian west - opposed to Yanukovich and supporters of Tymoshenko - to either join Poland or form a new western state."
"It probably will not happen but, if it does, it must be peaceful and by consensus."
"What we must do here in the European Union is to support the legacy of the Orange Revolution and our common shared democratic values with Ukraine."
"(DE) Madam President, the battle is over and at least for the next parliamentary term, Mr Yanukovich will be president of Ukraine."
"It is encouraging that this was the result of a fair election."
"This also indicates that the voters did not want the various positions to be set in concrete, such as joining NATO, on the one hand, or the orientation towards Moscow, on the other."
"Mr Yanukovich will be well advised to continue the democratic process, not to concentrate solely on looking towards the East and to bring about noticeable improvements in the living conditions of the people of Ukraine."
"Otherwise, the results of the next elections will already have been decided."
"The EU must provide close support and assistance for this stabilisation process."
"It will be clear by the time of the European Football Championships in 2012 at the latest whether Ukraine has developed a common Ukrainian consciousness or whether it will continue to suffer from its linguistic and geographic divide."
"Again, I apologise to all those to whom I could not give the opportunity to speak."
"I am sure it is a subject to which we will return again."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me once again thank you for the opportunity of addressing you today."
"I believe that this has been a useful exchange of views, taking some concrete suggestions and remarks to reflect on."
"As I said at the beginning, Ukraine matters."
"It remains a partner of strategic importance for the European Union, and a leader in the region."
"EU-Ukraine relations have deepened considerably in the past years."
"I firmly believe that this dynamic should continue in the future."
"The pace and depth of the rapprochement of Ukraine to the European Union will depend on the implementation of reform."
"That will encourage me to be even braver."
"The EU stands ready to support Ukraine in this task, with a wide range of tools at its disposal."
"Nevertheless, we look to the new leadership to demonstrate the political will for reform in the interests of Ukraine's future stability and prosperity."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the second part-session in February."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Ukraine is particularly important to the European Union from the perspective of getting involved in the Eastern Partnership and Black Sea Synergy and for the EU's energy security."
"My contribution today will refer to an aspect which is not mentioned very much, but which is of particular concern to me when we are talking about Ukraine."
"More than half a million ethnic Romanians live in this country."
"The authorities in Kiev have hitherto shown them little interest in terms of guaranteeing basic rights."
"However, we saw for the first time that during the election campaign in this country neighbouring Romania, a new concept of governance was promoted."
"One of the candidates guaranteed Romanians in this country that he would support the introduction of Romanian as a regional language in areas where Romanians are in the majority."
"Ukraine is currently faced with two value systems."
"Some citizens would like to move closer to the European Union and want our values, such as freedom and peace, to be guaranteed."
"Another group of citizens look at European integration with distrust."
"Ukraine needs support and solidarity from the EU to continue the reforms already under way in order to eliminate this division between East and West."
"After the presidential elections, a new chapter begins in relations between the EU and Ukraine."
"One of the most important areas of cooperation will be the issue of energy supply."
"This is no accident, as the European Union, with its increasing dependency, has a notable portion of energy imports coming via its easterly neighbour."
"For the security of energy imports, I think it is justified that the European Union should assist Ukraine by every possible means in maintaining and modernising its energy network, especially the vital gas pipeline network."
"At the same time, in agreement with the conclusions of the June EU summit, I think that there is a fundamental pre-requisite for financial support: Ukraine should start its reform of the industry and make its gas industry more transparent."
"The lack of transparency in the system of intermediary companies has resulted in disadvantages for the citizens of Ukraine, while also hindering the security of supply for EU Member States."
"Furthermore, efforts aimed at expanding storage capacity are also worth supporting."
"In fact, establishing reserves is one of the main ways to guarantee the smooth transit of gas in Europe during the cold winter period."
"The European Parliament is expected to adopt the new gas supply regulation for the EU in spring."
"This regulation will require Member States to approve coordinated action plans in the event of gas supply disruptions."
"I think that Member States will need to coordinate such action plans not only among themselves, but also by involving Ukraine in the consultation process."
"Even in future, resolving the issue of disruptions to imports is not something that is conceivable without intensive talks with leaders in Kiev."
"The election of Viktor Yanukovich as president means that Ukraine is entering a new phase which will bring it closer to the EU."
"As a member of the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and a European citizen, I believe that the European Union can and should tip the balance in favour of a European and democratic path for its eastern neighbour."
"The European Parliament Election Observation Mission welcomed that the ballot passed off lawfully without incident, thereby guaranteeing the legitimacy of the new president and marking a particular contrast to the elections which took place in 2004-2005."
"The change of political hue must not affect our approach to Ukraine, which must remain just as consistent and even more effective."
"Although it is well known that President Yanukovich is not going to weaken ties with Russia, this does not mean that he is going to move away from the EU."
"In order to precisely avoid the risk of this happening, however small, we must be proactive in handling relations with Ukraine, which is the only country able to guarantee stability in the area."
"We must show openness through dialogue and firm commitments so as to give Ukraine the necessary encouragement towards a pro-European development."
"I am confident in Ukraine's ability to resume the reforms and demonstrate that it is a trustworthy partner for the EU."
"in writing. - Ukraine continues to be crucial for the stability and democratic development of Europe."
"Although the Orange Revolution to which the European Parliament so effectively contributed has disappointed most expectations, it is to be hoped that the legacy of Mr Yushchenko's Presidency - free and fair elections, people who have overcome fear when voicing their opinions and a basically independent media - will endure."
"It is true that a big country like Ukraine that has been deprived of independence for a long time and has suffered a real genocide - the Holodomor - will need some time to better define its European identity and future strategic goals."
"But we cannot look away from the responsibility of European Union policies toward Ukraine since 2004."
"The EU has not been eager to offer Ukraine the prospect of EU membership."
"The EU's support of Ukraine has proved to be mostly ambiguous and not convincing to the Ukrainians as it has often been dominated by a fear of irritating Russia."
"We need to realise that the main key to a genuinely democratic and good neighbourly Russia is an independent and Europe-integrated Ukraine."
"This will remain the EU's responsibility."
"Now we need to make maximum use of the Eastern Partnership."
"Madam President, I have taken note of the information given about the election of Viktor Yanukovich as President of Ukraine."
"Although Ukraine is in a very serious situation, changes for the better can be seen in terms of respect for the law in the period since the previous elections."
"I hope the legal dispute over the election results will be resolved quickly and that both sides will concentrate on work to help Ukraine come out of the economic crisis and strengthen its position in the world and, in particular, to help Ukraine develop closer relations with the European Union."
"In view of the newly-elected President's promises to increase democratisation and ensure international stability, as well as the fact that he places great emphasis on Ukraine's accession to the European Union, I am convinced that the current good cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union should not only be continued, but extended."
"Representatives of all EU countries hope that Ukraine will, finally, enter a period of political stability and consensus on economic policy."
"In my opinion, Ukraine's new leader will also turn to the European Union for help in bringing Ukraine more rapidly out of its profound crisis, as a result of which there has been a horrendous economic decline and a 12% budget deficit."
"Europe should consider making a specific proposal to include Ukraine in European structures."
"I hope that the new president will take into account the pro-European direction expressed by the majority of Ukrainians."
"The association agreement is being negotiated and I believe that it is beneficial to both sides to conclude it as quickly as possible."
"Election promises must be fulfilled."
"One of these is respect for the rights of minorities and the removal of the policies on denationalising and assimilating ethnic minorities."
"Romania can serve as a model for Ukraine when it comes to applying European standards to the situation of minorities."
"In this respect, the MP representing the Ukrainian community in Romania in the Romanian Parliament can act as a good adviser, and I recommend him to the future president of Ukraine."
"Ukraine is a European state and shares all of Europe's cultural values."
"Ukraine needs to implement honestly and effectively a political programme guaranteeing rights to national minorities such as Russians, Tatars, Romanians, Poles, Hungarians, Greeks and others. It has to implement the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which guarantees these languages the status of regional languages."
"I believe that the EU must support the implementation of such measures, stressing that not a single minority should be overlooked."
"For example, there is a Romanian-speaking minority in Ukraine numbering more than 410 000."
"It is a traditional national community with deep historical roots, which lives in harmony with the majority and other minorities, especially in the Chernivtsi Region (Northern Bukovina, Northern Bessarabia and the Hertsa Region), the Odessa Region (districts in Southern Bessarabia) and in the Transcarpathian Region (historical MaramureÅ Region)."
"I think that the EU must encourage the Ukraine authorities to develop sections offering teaching in Romanian as a mother tongue in the vocational colleges and secondary schools currently operating in the towns in the regions mentioned above."
"In addition, the EU should cooperate with Kiev so that the Chernivtsi State University establishes sections offering teaching in Romanian as a mother tongue in all the current departments and specialties."
"I am pleased that the Ukrainian elections last Sunday passed off well."
"The results of the elections must be acknowledged by all the parties involved as a democracy cannot be built on permanent distrust and dispute."
"I am sorry that Yulia Tymoshenko lost the elections."
"However, I am even sorrier about the numerous statements she made during the latter part of the campaign, which disputed the judgment of the International Court of Justice relating to the Black Sea continental shelf."
"I hope that the Ukrainian Government, regardless of whether it is going to be led by Mrs Tymoshenko or anyone else, will accept the fact that such a judgment is definitive."
"Viktor Yanukovich promised the following measures to the Hungarian minority in Ukraine if he wins the election: immediate withdrawal of restrictions affecting the Hungarian education system, Hungarian primary school pupils and final-year students; unrestricted use of their mother tongue in education, justice, public administration, the media and other areas; unrestricted use of national symbols, unimpeded contact with their mother country; involvement of community representatives in local, regional and national public administration."
"The results of the presidential elections in regions with a higher proportion of Hungarian residents and the narrow margin of the final results indicate that the votes of the Hungarian community contributed to the victory of Mr Yanukovich to a great extent."
"In the heat of the campaign, Yulia Tymoshenko also promised to cancel the discriminatory measures affecting mother-tongue education."
"However, this did not sound credible coming from a politician who has been prime minister for 5 years and during that time showed no interest in the problems of the minorities."
"So the Hungarian and Ruthenian minority now put their hopes in Mr Yanukovich, expecting him to recognise the regional status of minorities and to create new grounds for relations between the majority and the minorities."
"However, if the new Ukrainian president fails to fulfil his promises, for example, in return for support from Ukrainian nationalists, he would not only lose the support of minority communities, but the establishment of the much-heralded European Ukraine may also be delayed for years."
"The European Union should play a more active role in Ukraine; we should stop the practice that has prevailed over the last few years of the European Union treating one of the largest states in Europe in an uncertain and half-hearted way."
"Ukraine is a major partner in the Eastern Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union and it is also the most important transit state for relations cultivated with Russia."
"With Viktor Yanukovich elected as president, Ukraine has a strong, easy-going leader who is open towards both Europe and Russia alike."
"The most important task for the new president will be to overcome the deep political divide so that a stable administration can be established and the long-overdue, comprehensive social and economic reforms can be implemented."
"The most important thing for the European Union now is to make its presence felt more strongly than before in Ukraine, and to establish new grounds for cooperation."
"The Eastern Partnership provides an excellent framework for this, and the External Action Service created pursuant to the Treaty of Lisbon will provide appropriate means."
"I would like to emphasise that Hungary, with Ukraine being its largest neighbour, is particularly interested in political and economic stability being established in Ukraine."
"It is also in our interest that relations between Ukraine and Russia are consolidated."
"We also very much hope that Ukraine will give up its anti-minority policies, which have encroached upon the rights of minorities in the Lower Carpathians region, including those of Hungarians."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0006/2010)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: Creating an internal energy market"
"Creating a single internal energy market is referred to as a political priority in the agreement and long-term strategy of the troika of Spain, Belgium and Hungary."
"In order to attain this objective, the most isolated regions of the Community, such as the Baltic Sea region, need to be better integrated into the European energy market."
"The Baltic Sea Strategy contains many electricity and gas interconnection projects, which, if implemented, will allow Baltic countries to break free from their energy dependency on a single supplier."
"In view of their cross-border nature, implementing these projects successfully will depend not only on providing funding but also on the political will and intentions of the Member States involved."
"In creating an internal energy market, the Community has undertaken to speak with one voice."
"Will Spain, which holds the Presidency of the Council, take a lead role in encouraging Member States to speak with one voice in the implementation of energy projects in the Baltic Sea region, such as AmberLitPol, Swedlink and others, that would bring about an increase in energy security not only at a regional level but throughout the Community?"
"Madam President, the internal energy market and security of energy supply are inextricably linked."
"We have gradually realised this in the European Union and energy security has therefore become one of the Union's strategic priorities."
"Indeed, this became a critical issue just over a year ago, with the gas crisis between Russia and Ukraine."
"We realised at that point that an internal energy market, a fully-functioning, interconnected, effective market, is a precondition for security of energy supply to Europe."
"Security of supply is thus a key strategic element that has to be improved by ensuring greater energy efficiency, by diversification of energy suppliers, sources and distribution channels, by promoting the Union's energy interests in relation to third countries and, finally, by creating a genuine common energy market, which we still do not have."
"To help us achieve this, we will have the support of the Lisbon Treaty, in which, for the first time, there is an explicit reference to that competence for the Union at primary legislation level."
"The Union therefore needs to be more assertive in its relations with third countries, and it must speak with a single voice in those relations."
"The Spanish Minister of Industry, Tourism and Trade made this very clear when presenting the Spanish Presidency's priorities to the relevant committee of the European Parliament on 27 January 2010."
"Consequently, within the framework of the Second Strategic Energy Review, what can be called connecting the energy islands in the European Union to the internal market has become one of the Union's key objectives."
"In July 2009, when the Commission presented the Action Plan on Baltic Energy Market Interconnection, an initiative that aims to promote the integration of the energy market and the development of energy infrastructure in the Baltic region, the European Council welcomed it as a major contribution to enhancing the energy security of the Union, and I am reading this word for word."
"The Baltic energy market initiative now falls under the wider umbrella of the Union's Baltic Sea Strategy, which was one of the Swedish Presidency's main priorities."
"The October 2009 European Council adopted the initiative and welcomed the progress made on energy infrastructures and interconnections in the Baltic region, thereby endorsing the information in the Commission's report."
"(LT) Minister, once again, I would like to thank you for your thoughts and answer."
"However, one aspect of my question was related not just to third countries but the European Union itself, namely that some European Union Member States have neither an economic nor political interest in contributing in some way or other to joint projects."
"So my question was whether, during the Presidency, Spain is taking on a political role to speak on behalf of the European Union to ensure the implementation of these future projects?"
"Madam President, we believe that undoubtedly forms part of a common energy policy and that just as we do not want to have energy islands from a technical point of view, we do not want to have them from a political point of view either."
"That is certainly not a position that you could call pro-European and, in fact, that has not been the case in practice."
"I seem to remember that during the debate on the Regulation on measures to guarantee the security of energy supply, a European commitment on this issue was agreed."
"I am referring specifically to the energy projects approved as part of the programme to aid economic recovery implemented during the Czech Presidency last year."
"A total of EUR 425 million was allocated to three interconnection projects in the Baltic region: the Skanled/Baltic gas pipeline, the Estlink-2 electricity interconnection and the Sweden-Baltic States interconnection."
"The Spanish Presidency will therefore urge the Member States to support the energy infrastructure projects in the Baltic region, although it will then be up to the Member States themselves to implement the specific projects in accordance with national legislation and applicable European legislation."
"The Member States concerned should also act as one on this matter."
"Before we go on, can I just make it clear to everybody in the Chamber that the Minister is prepared to stay until 19.20, so there will be more questions than would be taken up to 19.00."
"(RO) Minister, I would like to draw attention to the importance of integrating renewable energy sources into the national power grid, with the European power grid being made up of the Member States' power networks."
"The Baltic States provide an example of good practice in using renewable energy sources and in energy efficiency in buildings."
"An internal energy market needs better interconnection between national power networks."
"I would like to ask you whether you have an action plan, along with Member States, aimed at the use of renewable energy sources."
"(DE) The process of integrating the electricity market in the Baltic states should include unrestricted deregulation of the market for private customers and a common energy exchange."
"The Baltic States have been hit very hard by the economic crisis."
"Therefore, I would like to know how a total deregulation of the energy market can be achieved realistically in this very fragile economic situation."
"I am thinking in particular of price volatility."
"What is the plan with regard to the infrastructure in the Baltic States and what will happen about the diversification of energy transport routes and energy sources?"
"Madam President, we agree with the views expressed on the subject of renewable energies and their integration into the European energy network."
"We also believe it is one of the main objectives of the European Union's strategy for the fight against climate change, which we argued for at the Copenhagen Summit."
"We hope that by 2020 renewable energies will make up 20% of the overall European energy mix, and we would like that approach to be included in the second Energy Action Plan for 2010-2014, which we hope to see adopted under the Spanish Presidency."
"That objective of the action plan is therefore clearly on the Spanish Presidency's agenda, and is shared, of course, by the Belgian and Hungarian Trio, because it is a strategic objective."
"With regard to what Mr Obermayr has said, we also believe that diversifying resources is, without doubt, another strategic objective, as I mentioned earlier."
"The European Union and its institutions are being very proactive, giving all their political support to projects such as Nabucco, Nord Stream and South Stream."
"All those projects have a very clear objective: to diversify energies, to diversify suppliers of energy, and to diversify the different channels by which energy is distributed."
"They are, of course, part of our strategy to become a Europe with a truly common energy market, which it currently does not have."
"All of this is necessary in order to establish that market and to achieve that energy security, which forms the basis for it all."
"Subject: Development approaches, objectives and actions under the EU's 2020 sustainable development strategy"
"The economic crisis, climate change and demographic changes are having a drastic impact on the lives of European citizens."
"Health, education, agriculture, the development of transport and energy infrastructure and investment in research and innovation and in the modernising of public services must be priorities, both for the Member States and for the EU."
"There is a joint obligation to guarantee the fundamental rights and freedoms of European citizens, including the free movement of workers."
"The European social model ensures the necessary support for employees who have lost their jobs, for the elderly and for the young, as well as for migrant workers."
"The EU's 2020 sustainable development strategy is to be presented at the informal European Council meeting in February 2010."
"Could the Spanish Council Presidency indicate what the main development approaches, objectives and actions will be under that strategy, and what resources it estimates will be needed for its successful implementation?"
"Madam President, there is no doubt that the 2020 strategy is probably the most ambitious and important objective for the immediate future, and is going to be at the centre of the debates that are being held in Brussels tomorrow in the informal European Council, and which are taking place at the highest possible political level under the Spanish Presidency."
"The aim is to propose and approve a programme promoting growth and the creation of quality employment, replacing the Lisbon Strategy and focusing, on the one hand, on strengthening certain indispensable aspects which are necessary for the competitiveness and productivity of the future European economy: investing in information technologies, making Europe a space for the information society, and highlighting social aspects as well, meaning that employment should be based on specialisation and training; we are also, of course, driving for a green, low carbon economy as referred to in the content we have already discussed."
"Another fundamental element - one that will no doubt polarise tomorrow's debates in Brussels - is the issue of governance."
"At the informal European Council meeting, the President of the European Council is going to present an initial proposal for a debate on governance, in other words, moving towards economic union within Europe, not only monetary union, and making it essential - as stated in the Treaty of Lisbon - that our economic policies, our employment policies and our social policies converge within the European Union."
"This element of the strategy for sustainable development and the creation of quality employment is therefore a central objective of the Spanish Presidency and the whole of Europe."
"The proof of this can be seen in the fact that we have begun to tackle the matter already, at the highest level, by holding the informal Council meeting tomorrow in Brussels."
"(RO) We also now have comments which have come from the stakeholders."
"The public consultation about the EU 2020 strategy on the Commission website is over."
"However, we have a 10% unemployment rate in the European Union, and it has reached 20% in Spain and Latvia."
"This is why I would like you to tell us what measures we are taking for the benefit of the European Union's citizens in order to preserve and create jobs and, above all, improve their quality of life."
"I think that at the centre of the future 2020 strategy must be exactly those points you make and, to be precise, Mrs TicÄu, jobs must not be so precarious, so volatile, so unstable as has been the case in the European Union."
"You mentioned the case of Spain which indeed has suffered greatly in the property sector."
"Therefore, we need to aim towards a production model which in itself creates stronger, more solid, more stable jobs based on specialisation."
"Thus, we must work towards measures along these lines, measures which increase specialisation and staff training in order to place workers in knowledge-based society, information technology and specialised society jobs, upon which the production and development model for future employment should be based."
"That is the idea which we believe each country should put into practice; however, we must coordinate this among all European countries."
"Furthermore, the European Union must provide support, for example, through incentives or stimuli such as the use of specific Structural Funds, for instance, the European Social Fund, thus stimulating those countries which indeed invest in this production model so as to create quality employment."
"That, I think is the guideline which should be at the centre, at the very heart of our strategy which, between us all, must be implemented within the next few months, before the European Council in June to replace the inadequate Lisbon Strategy."
"Subject: Freedom of religion in China"
"What steps does the Council plan to take to improve the situation of religious communities and, in particular, of Christian churches, and the implementation of the right to freedom of religion in China?"
"Madam President, Mr Posselt, you will be perfectly aware that one of the main instruments of our relations concerning the human rights issue in China is the biannual human rights dialogue which was set up more than 15 years ago."
"It is therefore a structured Dialogue which gives us the opportunity to exchange viewpoints regarding matters which are of concern to us."
"In November last year, the Council adopted conclusions about religious freedom which allowed us to once again reiterate the European Union's position on this subject, in clear terms."
"Respect for religious freedom, as defined in the international instruments on human rights, forms part of the human rights clause which is included in agreements between the European Union and third countries."
"Over the last five years, the European Union has periodically brought up freedom of religion and beliefs in its dialogues on human rights and in its consultations with third countries."
"It has made a number of statements regarding this and negotiations have taken place in relation to people threatened for their beliefs."
"The European Union has played a very active part, on a global scale, in promoting religious freedom in international fora, such as the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Council."
"As regards China, the Council determined a certain number of reference criteria for the human rights dialogue in 2001."
"I can assure you, Mr Posselt, that religious freedom forms an integral part of those criteria."
"We recently discussed this issue several times with our Chinese counterparts, we have met with the competent authorities in Beijing and, with the purpose of the dialogue in mind, those responsible for religious matters have visited Europe in order to increase their awareness of practices in a number of Member States."
"(DE) Mr Garrido, thank you very much for your detailed answer."
"I have two brief additional questions."
"Firstly, when will you next have the opportunity to discuss these matters with China?"
"Secondly, could you push for a list to be drawn up of the priests, nuns and bishops who have been arrested?"
"I have already said that there is a structured dialogue and so a series of conversations take place regularly with China, on this subject."
"We, the Council, are aware that there are a certain number of people practising religion who have been threatened or have been subjected to practices which equate to persecution in China."
"This is the case with certain Tibetan Buddhists who are practitioners of Falun Gong, and has also occurred with Christians, priests and believers as well as the lawyers which have defended them in some cases."
"The Council has investigated these cases and has brought them to the attention of the Chinese authorities."
"On all these occasions, we have said that the peaceful practice of religion is a right and that it should never be considered as a threat to the State."
"Of course, honourable Members, I must reaffirm that with regard to the application of religious freedom in China and the evaluation process of the human rights dialogue, we will examine all the ways in which we can maximise our ability to produce positive changes in this area."
"I thank the Council for its reply."
"A lot done; a lot more to do."
"The reality of it is that, as regards religious practice in China, Article 36 of the Constitution of the People's Republic states exactly what is involved."
"It is very carefully phrased."
"'Religious belief' is guaranteed, but what about practice?"
"What constitutes 'normal religious activities'?"
"And, as regards 'foreign domination', if an outside preacher comes in, that is regarded as 'foreign domination'."
"And the religions that are really looked at askance are Buddhism, Catholicism, Deism, Islam and Protestant Christianity."
"A lot done, but an awful lot more to do - so keep up the good work."
"(DE) Thank you for your accurate answers, Mr Garrido."
"However, I would like to ask for some even more detailed information."
"Is there a clause in the current bilateral agreement with China which is intended to provide special protection for Christian churches or is the Council planning to introduce a clause of this kind?"
"Honourable Members, indeed, there is still work to be done, but we certainly place our trust in the dialogue and what we could refer to as the impact of the dialogue and its effects."
"As Baroness Ashton said in the European Parliament a short while ago: the human rights dialogue does undeniably have an effect and, of course, there are various places we can conduct it."
"We can conduct it with specific people, for example, in the case of the well-known human rights activist, Liu Xiaobo, or we can also conduct it on other levels, on a political level in political dialogue."
"In any case, we will continue to conduct it with determination so as to protect all human rights, each and every one."
"We must not support some more than others, as human rights are indivisible and we will strive to strengthen and improve the situation concerning human rights in China."
"Dialogue is essential and, of course, it is also essential to see how changes take place in this area, and we are certain that the Chinese authorities, our counterparts, appreciate the importance of this dialogue."
"Subject: CIA - secret prisons and flights"
"Recent press reports have revealed the existence of a secret prison in Lithuania, located in a former riding school and used by the CIA since 2004, where a number of 'terrorism suspects' have been tortured."
"An Italian court has found more than 20 US agents and two Italian officials guilty of the kidnapping in Milan of Abu Omar, who was subsequently tortured in Egypt."
"A number of other trials are under way, notably in Poland and the UK."
"There is evidence that other governments and, in particular, Portugal, were (in the context of a secret NATO agreement) aware of the use of their airspace and airports for maintaining the detention, kidnapping and torture network masterminded by the US."
"What is the Council's position on this new information and these trials, and what explanations can it furnish?"
"What measures will it propose to ensure that these circumstances are not repeated in the future?"
"I would, firstly, like to reiterate the support of the European Union for the United Nations global strategy for fighting terrorism, which recognises that development, peace, security and human rights are interconnected and reinforce each other."
"The so-called secret detention and transportation programme by the United States or the alleged CIA use of European countries to transport and illegally detain prisoners has been, without a doubt, a source of concern for many Members of this House."
"It was the subject of a very recent debate, just a few days ago, and, as the Presidency has already said, the Council clearly shares Parliament's view, there is no two ways about it; that the possible existence of these secret detention centres does not comply with international law."
"This continues to be our opinion."
"That is why we felt it was so appropriate for President Obama to change US policy in relation to certain detentions and to the existence of prisons such as GuantÃ¡namo."
"What is more, we believe that, in reality, this change has occurred and a turnaround has occurred in US policy."
"We have always taken the opportunity to express our concerns to the United States from a European Union standpoint regarding these matters."
"We must be pleased that this change has taken place and because this joint declaration was made official between the European Union and the United States on 15 June last year."
"We therefore believe that we will remain along the lines of this policy and we will always be very clear as long as we are aware and have irrefutable proof of the existence of these cases."
"In certain cases, we have not had this evidence, although it has been talked about, or there have been specific references made in the media; however, on some occasions, there has been a lack of proven and thorough knowledge of the existence of these cases."
"However, there is no doubt that the European Union has been very clear on this matter and has always been against these detention centres, whether they be known detention centres such as GuantÃ¡namo, or allegedly secret ones, and we have always been very open in the European Union to finding out the facts as to whether the latter really exist."
"(PT) Madam President, Minister, thank you for your response."
"In fact, however, even after that statement in July, there were new discoveries."
"It is known that last November, the Italian court itself convicted 23 US agents and two Italian officials of the kidnapping of Abu Omar in Milan, and one of the convicted CIA agents admitted to the press that he broke the law and that the decisions had been made in Washington."
"The Obama Administration merely declared that it was disappointed with the decision by the Italian court."
"Other cases, also relating to CIA flights, are under way, such as in Poland and the United Kingdom."
"The Lithuanian Parliament has confirmed that there was also a clandestine jail in Lithuania, and that many flights by the CIA covered up their activities and, of course, led to people being illegally imprisoned."
"The question is this: will we denounce the human rights violations that are inherent in all of this?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) We are defenders of human rights and I believe we can say this clearly and confidently; therefore, we do not have a right but an obligation to denounce cases of human rights infringements, wherever they may take place."
"It is also true that the European Union must respect the competence of Member States and so specific areas must be investigated by Member States; they cannot be investigated by the European Union."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, for example, makes it very clear that the supervision of intelligence services in Member States' territory is a Member State's competence."
"With respect to something also mentioned in the question, we are certainly not aware of an alleged secret NATO agreement."
"In any case, the possible existence of this agreement, of which we are completely unaware, would by no means prevent Member States from having to carry out their obligations in accordance with international law and humanitarian law."
"However, Mrs Figueiredo, we certainly believe the European Union is clearly one of the areas in the world where human rights are respected and the European Union is obliged, while respecting how each country chooses to govern itself, and will obviously always be obliged, to denounce human rights infringements, as we have a responsibility to humanity and not only to each of the competent States."
"We will continue to act and develop along these lines."
"What is more, we now have a new more important reference point, which is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of citizens of Europe."
"(LT) Minister, the media and media sources were mentioned in the question, because it was precisely the media that broke the news of the setting up of a secret prison in Lithuania and elsewhere."
"How do you assess in general the role of the media in these matters, and would it be possible to mobilise public opinion, so that such events are not repeated?"
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to make a statement thanking Mr LÃ³pez Garrido for what he has said, but he has not said anything new."
"Three years ago, a special parliamentary commission was appointed on GuantÃ¡namo."
"The European Council also worked on this matter, and now keeps coming back to it."
"There are, really, more important matters, and it is true, as Mr LÃ³pez Garrido said, that it is the Member States which are obliged to monitor human rights."
"One more thing - Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, when speaking about China, you said that there are different human rights and we should uphold them all."
"However, the fundamental right of liberty in dictatorships is liberty itself, and I think that, first of all, we should stand up for the right to liberty."
"I agree with the points made by the last speakers."
"I believe that the defence of human rights is one of the crucial objectives that any democratic State and any democratic organisation such as the European Union must pursue."
"Of course the European Parliament has a culture of defending human rights, of which we are proud and also of the European integration, in this sense, as the construction of Europe is based on human rights."
"The nature of Europe and what unites Europeans who speak different languages and have different traditions is precisely the fact that we share these values of defending human rights."
"In this respect, I believe that the role of the press is an absolutely vital one."
"The press is a key feature at the centre of democracy and is undoubtedly a necessary and indispensable instrument for the defence of human rights and for denouncing cases of human rights infringements when they occur."
"When these infringements take place but are not known about other than on a personal level, it is simply impossible for us to pursue them."
"Therefore, the press plays a fundamentally vital role and I also believe that the most genuine and authentic culture of journalism must be extremely sensitive to the defence of human rights and the defence of all freedoms."
"That is what truly ensures that life is worth living and it is what ultimately gives meaning to the coexistence of human beings."
"The pursuit of those who infringe human rights and the defence of victims is, without a doubt, one of the axes of the European integration, of the European Union, and I feel very proud to belong to an area in which those values are cherished and where instruments of legal, supranational, judicial independence have been established, such as the European Court of Human Rights which is located in this city, Strasbourg."
"I feel very proud that Europe preserves precisely these objectives and truths in its tradition, in its culture and in its history."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"Question Time is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.25 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Composition of Parliament: see Minutes"
"Effects of the economic crisis on world trade (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Vital Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the effects of the economic crisis on world trade - B7-0005/2010)."
"author. - Madam President, I am going to put the question on behalf of my committee, the Committee on International Trade, and as the chair of this committee."
"The effects of the crisis on world trade indicate a possible 10% decline in 2009."
"This represents the biggest such contraction since the Second World War brought on by the collapse in global demand."
"Keeping international trade flowing is vital for the EU and other exports-oriented countries."
"Despite commitments made by the G20, trade restrictive and distortive measures in response to the crisis have increased within the G20, as well as globally."
"The first sub-question is: what steps have been taken by the Commission to tackle such measures and, conversely, have any steps been taken by third countries against any other EU measures to boost economic growth?"
"The second sub-question: there are indicators that some of the emerging countries that have been less affected by the crisis are becoming drivers of growth in international trade."
"In this case, EU industry needs to retarget its export markets and possibly the future of its products."
"What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to enable EU industry to become more competitive?"
"Third sub-question: the global crisis and subsequent fall in world trade are having multiple effects on developing countries where the most unemployment is concentrated."
"What adjustment measures does the Commission plan to take in its trade relations in particular for the poorest countries in the world?"
"Fourth point: while, on the one hand, large trade deficits are driven by excessive spending and indebtedness in some Member States, including the United States of America, on the other hand, large export-driven economies in certain emerging countries are experiencing trade surpluses."
"These trade deficits have contributed to global imbalances that are at the root of the global economic crisis."
"What strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to mitigate such global imbalances in its trade policy?"
"Fifth and last point: the social impact of the economic crisis and the subsequent fall in world trade are set to outlast economic recovery."
"For example, we are seeing signs of economic recovery now, but levels of unemployment remain very high."
"When does the Commission plan to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of the crisis on jobs in Europe and in the developing countries?"
"What strategy does it intend to pursue to incorporate the social and environmental dimension of trade into international WTO rules?"
"These are the five points that the Committee on International Trade would like to address to the new Trade Commissioner Mr De Gucht, whom I welcome to the floor for the first public exchange of views with Parliament and the members of the INTA Committee, in particular."
"Thank you in advance for the answers that I am sure you will be able to give to the questions that we are putting to you."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, quite a lot of broad questions have been asked which would, in fact, deserve much more time than I have."
"I suggest focusing in my initial reply on the contribution of trade policy to economic recovery."
"First, as regards the impact of the crisis on trade, we should be relieved that world trade only decreased by 10%."
"This did not happen by chance, but is a result of strong political will expressed at various G20 summits."
"It is also the result of systematic monitoring of trade restrictive measures by the WTO, the OECD and the Commission."
"By and large, only a few countries resorted to trade protectionism."
"The international community thus avoided a protectionist downward spiral of the kind witnessed at the time of the Great Depression."
"In order to maintain this, it is important to remain extremely vigilant."
"Where protectionist or trade-restrictive measures are identified, we will take action against them with all available trade tools, such as our market-access strategy or even the WTO dispute-settlement mechanism."
"External sources of growth will be crucial to EU economic recovery."
"I therefore concur with you that European industry should target the new and fast-growing emerging markets."
"Through our trade policy, we can help them to achieve this by further opening up these markets and reducing all sorts of barriers to trade and investment."
"This will be achieved through the free trade agreements that we are currently negotiating and by deepening trade and economic partnerships with key trading partners such as, for example, the US and China, where the TEC and the high-level dialogue have already laid solid foundations."
"This will be a priority for me as Trade Commissioner."
"Over the coming weeks, the Commission will put together the EU's new common agenda for sustainable growth and recovery via the EU 2020 strategy."
"This strategy will have an effective external dimension in which trade policy plays a key role."
"In a globalised world, the EU 2020 strategy should be a vector to promote openness and constructive international economic engagement."
"This will also be a central theme of a communication on future trade-policy priorities that I intend to present later this year."
"But trade policy is about more than just competitiveness and growth."
"It is also about projecting our values worldwide and it must also duly integrate the development dimension of trade."
"Promoting a strong contribution to development goals is already an important part of the EU's trade policy."
"The current multilateral negotiations are a development round."
"We have bilateral and regional negotiations with developing countries and autonomous preferences in favour of these countries."
"We help them to contribute to, and also tap into, the global economy so as to raise living standards in a way that delivers both greater political stability and social progress."
"As regards social issues, I agree that trade must contribute to helping those people in our societies who suffered most from the economic crisis, especially those who lost their jobs."
"In this respect, I believe that we will need trade - and more trade - to preserve our social system of protection in Europe."
"Our European model of society, the combination of a free economy with a high degree of social protection, must be preserved in a sustainable way, and this will take growth."
"In sum, the Commission's forthcoming EU 2020 strategy will support a full recovery from the crisis while speeding up the move towards a smarter and greener economy."
"Open trade policy will be an important element, both as a contribution to European economic recovery and as a vector for the external projection of our principles: openness, social and environmental protection and sustainability, and constructive engagement on the world scene."
"Putting the right strategy in place will naturally involve working closely with Parliament as well as the Council and other stakeholders, and I look forward to your cooperation in building a shared agenda."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to start by welcoming the Commissioner."
"It is a pleasure to see you here."
"We have high expectations and hopes of you."
"You have an important task ahead of you."
"A year ago, I was extremely concerned."
"When trade crashed and we were expecting world trade to develop in ways not seen since the Second World War, the situation was very serious indeed."
"The World Bank stated that 17 of the G20 countries had, in total, introduced 47 new trade barriers and tariffs."
"Russia imposed tariffs on cars, China restricted food imports, India banned imports of toys and Argentina introduced import licences for textiles and leather goods."
"It was almost like a protectionist arms race - a pattern from the 1930s that was worrying."
"However, no trade war came about."
"I think it is important to stop and reflect on why that was."
"I think the main reason was the WTO, the global regulatory authority for trade, which forces countries to behave and not to resort to protectionism and populism."
"I would say that it is too early to declare the crisis over."
"The crisis has not passed."
"We all know that unemployment is highest late in the economic cycle - and it is unemployment that drives protectionism and populism."
"If we look around us right now, we can see that a number of countries have not yet come through the crisis; perhaps they even have the worst yet to come."
"I am therefore somewhat concerned when I listen to some members of the Council of Ministers, who do not say much about new markets and free trade but rather criticise globalisation and talk of protecting European companies and European jobs."
"That is not necessarily protectionism, but at times, they are only a hair's breadth away."
"It is, in any event, an expression of a mercantilism that I believe to be damaging."
"We should instead work together and think about how we can make Europe more competitive by making it more open."
"That would amount to considered action and leadership on our part."
"We need to think about what we can do to make sure that there are fewer barriers to trade, not more - especially when it comes to making decisions on Korea and mandatory origin labelling and when there are increasing demands for climate levies."
"We in Parliament need to reflect on that too."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is currently experiencing an unprecedented crisis which, beyond the economic and financial crisis, represents first and foremost a crisis of the system."
"Even before beginning to deal with the effects of the economic crisis on world trade, which forms the topic of our debate, I wish to clarify one point: trade is not a victim of the crisis; it is also one of its contributing factors."
"Indeed, we are currently experiencing a period of huge global imbalances, fuelled, on the one hand, by certain countries' excessive trade deficits at the cost of growing domestic indebtedness and, on the other, by trade surpluses stimulated by the exports of certain, especially emerging, countries with internal consumption that is not growing at the same rate."
"Moreover, the trade liberalisation policy conducted thus far has only exacerbated these imbalances, weakening, in particular, the poorest countries on the planet."
"These countries, which have been encouraged to specialise in export monocultures, have therefore found themselves destitute in the face of extreme fluctuations in the prices of raw materials, the volatility of which has increased as a result of international speculation."
"It is a strange world that sets as its first Millennium Development Goal the eradication of poverty and hunger but then, at the same time, speculates on the rise in wheat prices."
"However, the very people who defended liberalisation and deregulation at any cost in the 1990s are now finding themselves in a difficult situation as well."
"The continual rise in job losses, stagnant, sometimes even negative, growth, and the developing social crisis are all factors that mean we can no longer afford to let jobs disappear in the name of this cult."
"In a period of crisis, how do we explain to employees who are losing their jobs that the main thing is to maintain deregulated trade, even at the cost of sudden and sometimes tragic relocations?"
"The crisis we are going through is therefore definitely a systemic crisis, to which we must respond with a new development model."
"In its current Global Europe strategy, the vision developed by the Commission is essentially based on access to the market and the liberalisation of all sectors."
"Commissioner, I believe we need to redefine this strategy, which has been on the wrong track and sometimes led to setbacks."
"It is not by forcing developing countries to open up even more that we will revive our industries' exports."
"That would only aggravate the situation in those countries, which already accommodate 70% of the 59 million people in the world who lost their jobs in 2009."
"On the contrary, it is essential to consider a new strategy that strikes the right balance between openness, protection and support."
"I would like to return to these ideas."
"We cannot ignore these developments, which lead the United States to make further use of its trade defence tool or China to take issue with the WTO over European anti-dumping measures."
"Indeed, when we are faced with unfair practices, it is clear that protection is necessary, but the principle of it must be accepted and defended internationally and the sometimes false accusations of protectionism dismissed once and for all."
"Moreover, the need for support for trade policies is becoming more obvious every day, and such support depends, in particular, on the policies implemented by the Union being genuinely consistent."
"Consistency in policies is not an intellectual debate, but an absolute necessity if we want to redefine a new development model."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has indeed had a detrimental impact on trade in the European Union Member States."
"For example, in countries like Bulgaria, exports for the first 11 months of last year fell by a whole 24% compared to the previous year, and imports by 35%."
"Property and tourism are sectors which have been particularly affected by this."
"This has an extremely powerful effect on employment."
"Consideration must be given to the sharp rise in business-to-business indebtedness, non-payment of national and local public contract organisations, etc."
"The problems presented above are typical of other countries as well."
"A comprehensive solution is needed for them at EU level, which requires close cooperation between the European Commission's various directorates too."
"Commissioner De Gucht emphasises the importance of support for expanding European companies' area of activity and opportunities, deploying clear preventive commercial instruments, successfully concluding the Doha negotiations, using new facilities for direct foreign investments and their protection, as well as for a new investment policy against the backdrop of a financial crisis."
"The achievement of these aims, along with the successful signing of the economic cooperation agreements with countries from Africa, the Caribbean Basin and Pacific Ocean region, is also closely linked to the recovery from the financial crisis."
"However, a number of issues remain on the agenda, some of which have already been mentioned."
"Are we making effective use of European funding to combat the high level of unemployment?"
"What can the European Union do faced with the current deficit, devaluation of the currency and high inflation, which are having a direct impact on trade?"
"What commercial policy instruments does the European Union have available to tackle the financial crisis and its repercussions?"
"What measures must be taken to avoid the recurrence of a crisis of such magnitude and for trade to continue expanding?"
"What strategy do we have against countries like India and China, which are threatening to change the entire financial system?"
"I am counting exclusively on this Europe 2020 strategy to find these answers."
"Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for having put the fantasy of crisis-related protectionism into its proper context."
"I think that, in the context of a debate, it is wise of you to point out that a world war linked to the revival of protectionism is not about to break out."
"Now, I almost want to reverse the issue."
"For me, the issue is not ultimately about what effects the economic crisis has on trade, but more fundamentally about what effects trade, and specifically the trade policies undertaken for 20 years, have on the crisis we are experiencing today."
"In a way, the food crisis that we experienced two and a half years ago arrived before the financial crisis, and it was indeed a crisis of the world agricultural markets."
"In the same way, we keep being told that liberalising trade with China is good for us."
"I believe that, at some point, unless we incorporate social issues, monetary issues, fiscal issues and, of course, environmental issues, China will have not just a comparative advantage over Europe, it will have an absolute advantage over it."
"It follows that, in all the national debates - and, as a key figure on the Belgian scene, you will know this - all the political parties are now discovering that it is impossible, in a globalised world, to manage social dumping, environmental dumping, monetary dumping and fiscal dumping."
"Similarly, we might consider that the strategy that all us Europeans expected after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which was to say 'social democracy will come about through trade', is not working, as we can see with the example of China."
"Commissioner, you have cited the Lisbon Strategy, innovation, the green economy, and you know that this European strategy is now a failure."
"Indeed, if we do not mainstream the Lisbon Strategy before the Global Europe strategy, we may wonder what industrial sectors Europe will still have."
"Where is the definition of the industrial choices, the agricultural choices, the economic choices and, of course, the social and environmental choices that we are making throughout Europe, so that we can learn how trade works with the rest of the world?"
"Until we define these choices, we shall be pursuing a strategy of failure."
"I have a more specific question: on 4 February 2010, a meeting of the WTO's Committee on Trade in Financial Services was held, and it focused specifically on the challenges presented by the financial crisis and the liberalisation of financial services."
"Can you tell us what the outcome of that meeting was and what your opinion is on this matter, if you were able to follow it?"
"Madam President, in the current global economy, most borders are allowing a more efficient flow of people, capital and services."
"This, of course, is intended to produce a better standard of living."
"This is all very well, as long as most countries achieve a positive trade balance and a growth in GDP."
"The problems begin when the economy slows down, market indices fall sharply and problems start with unemployment."
"The opening of borders, apart from bringing a better standard of living, has caused a mutual dependence of different economies on one another."
"This is the other side of the coin."
"This can be seen clearly in the current situation."
"For example, the slowing down of the German economy is having a negative effect on the Polish economy, and this is because Germany is one of Poland's key export partners."
"Fortunately, Poland's GDP is showing positive growth, which is an exception in Europe, but it is worrying that the unemployment rate has been rising for several months."
"This example shows very clearly that governments should not only think about how to solve economic problems exclusively in their own countries, but they should also come to an agreement about how, together, they can develop defensive mechanisms so that in future, they will be protected from similar situations."
"I think the present crisis will be a test for all of us."
"I am thinking principally, here, about countries belonging to the European Union."
"We cannot allow a situation in which some countries try to conceal their use of State interventionism, while, in the name of free competition, others are prevented from giving State aid."
"Of course, I do realise that particular governments may be, in a certain sense, hostages of their electorate, but if we are going to build a European Community for the good of everyone, we must make clear rules and we must keep them."
"We must also use our strengths - advanced technologies and human capital."
"Only in this way will further strengthening of cooperation between our countries be effective, and we, as citizens of the European Union, will be able to think of the future in better terms and hope that our (...)."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, world capitalism is experiencing its worst crisis since the Great Depression."
"As then, it is the working class and the poor who are paying dearly for, and suffering the consequences of, this, whether in Europe or in the poorest countries on earth."
"World Bank researchers predict that, in 2010 alone, 64 million more people will be plunged into extreme poverty by the crisis and that because of it, in 2009, between 30 000 and 50 000 children have already died in Africa of malnutrition."
"This crisis is having devastating consequences on world trade, but the demand of the United Nations financial summit last year, for example, that the conclusion of the Doha Round of trade negotiations is the answer, is utterly wrong."
"According to the respected NGO War on Want, that would threaten a further 7.5 million workers with losing their jobs, including in the poorest countries."
"This crisis of world capitalism is enormously exacerbated by the activities of the financial speculators on the world markets."
"Not content with having precipitated the crisis, these parasites now want to exploit it to rake in further billions."
"Did the EU Commission see the headline in the Financial Times yesterday: 'Traders in record bet against the euro'?"
"But what does the Commission do?"
"It falls on its knees in front of the speculators and demands that the countries worst hit by the crisis, like Greece, make savage cuts in workers' wages, pensions and public services."
"What do you think such a draconian programme of cuts is going to do for trade, either in Europe or in the world?"
"If you cut the ability of the working class to purchase goods and services, then you cut demand for those goods and services, which means you cut millions more jobs of workers who would provide them."
"That, concretely, is the prescription of the Commission."
"Therefore, the tens of thousands of Greek workers who marched yesterday were absolutely right."
"Capitalism can only bring more suffering and crisis."
"We need to replace it with a system of human solidarity, based on the values of democratic socialism."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, the great investor, Warren Buffet, once said 'when the tide goes down, you kind of get to see who is not wearing a bathing costume'."
"Last year, the UK economy contracted 4.8%."
"So did Italy's."
"The German economy contracted 5% and EU trade much more so."
"I am going to focus on the third question, which is: what strategy does the Commission intend to pursue to enable EU industry to become more competitive?"
"Well, before there was the Lisbon Treaty, there was the Lisbon Strategy, and in the Lisbon Strategy, the EU intended, and I quote, 'to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world'."
"Now, one prerequisite for a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy is to have a flexible work force."
"So what has the EU done to bring this about?"
"Well they have brought in the Agency Workers' Directive in 2008 and this has been like pouring glue into the most flexible part of the labour market."
"The Agency Workers' Directive is yet another ill-thought-out and inappropriate EU directive which has yet again disproportionately and adversely affected the UK, which has a third of all EU agency workers."
"And, incidentally, it is by having a flexible workforce that you raise people out of poverty."
"The EU's series of ill-considered directives stand in the way of a competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy emerging in the Member States."
"The EU economic crisis reveals that the EU has, as it were, no bathing costume."
"(HU) I would like to talk about two issues: the trade deficit and CO2 emissions."
"The document rightly states that the growth of the trade deficit of the European Union and the United States has contributed to the international economic crisis to a large extent."
"The trade deficit of the European Union grew from EUR 75 billion in 2004 to EUR 243 billion in 2008."
"This is a three-fold increase in 4 years."
"This means that the consumption of each European citizen exceeded produced value by EUR 500."
"Such a large trade deficit and a consumption that exceeds production to such an extent are not sustainable."
"Measures are required to reduce the trade deficit, because if we do not do this intentionally, the laws of economy will spontaneously enforce such a change."
"However, this would incur a much higher social cost."
"The current events in Greece illustrate this."
"As regards energy, world trade is not only distorted by protectionism, but also by energy price support mechanisms."
"The use of oil is subsidised in a number of developing countries, with oil being available at prices lower than on the international market, while budget resources are also used to support the use of electricity."
"At the same time, European producers need to pay taxes, carbon dioxide quotas, if they want to use energy in production."
"Copenhagen made it clear that developing countries wish to hinder a climate protection agreement as they are not willing to accept sanctions related to cuts."
"Measures are required to prevent this, as several economists have now pointed out that cheap carbon dioxide gives a more competitive edge to China than cheap labour."
"If we do not reduce energy consumption, there is a danger that again and again ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, as other speakers have said, the full impact of the financial crisis is now becoming clear."
"If you believe the Commission, trade dropped by 10% in 2009."
"If you believe the IMF, it dropped by 12.3% in 2009."
"The ILO itself reckons that 212 million people worldwide were unemployed in 2009, a 34 million increase from 2007."
"Sub-Saharan Africa, which had a fiscal surplus of 0.3% of GDP in 2008, had a deficit of 6.4% in 2009."
"In other words a surplus of three billion turned into a deficit of 64 billion, taking 67 billion out of Sub-Saharan Africa's spending power."
"All parts of the world have suffered because of this crisis, but the third world, the developing world, has suffered the most."
"And that is why today Oxfam have today launched a call for what they have called a 'Robin Hood tax'."
"This is a variation on the Tobin Tax, which was to tax speculative trade on financial products, stocks, bonds, commodities and currency transactions."
"The Robin Hood tax represents a tiny 0.05% of transactions, but would raise billions for development projects in the third world."
"The Millennium Development Goals need between 34 billion and 45 billion to be met and the banks received a trillion-dollar bail-out."
"Banks should do more than simply pay back that cash: they should repair the damage they have done to wider society."
"So this Robin Hood tax would be a good way to tackle poverty and to ensure that the banks make a socially useful contribution."
"Will the Commissioner look seriously at Oxfam's proposal, which has had an indication of support from the British Prime Minister, and put his weight behind it as a European Commissioner for Trade?"
"(SV) Madam President, our continent is a rich one."
"The EU must shoulder a particular responsibility for maintaining free and fair trade."
"The financial crisis is creating a global economic recession that depressed trade by 10% in 2009, as has been stated, such that trade is now at the same level as in 2005."
"Developing countries are particularly vulnerable when their exports fall and they have problems obtaining bank financing."
"For the ACP countries, for example, trade in goods represents 50% of their trade."
"These countries are thus extremely sensitive to crises."
"A 1% drop in growth results in 20 million people falling into poverty."
"Here, the EU must shoulder its responsibility as a rich part of the world and ensure that the financial crisis does not force more people into poverty and exclusion."
"The EU must work to ensure that the poorest countries receive increased levels of effective aid and debt relief where appropriate."
"In this context, my friends, I believe that a number of the countries that you come from could do more to ensure that the aid provided by your home countries is increased, improved and made more efficient."
"We should not always call on the EU; there are some things we can do on the home front."
"The most important priority for the Union is that the Doha Round is concluded and that the EU's agricultural policy is quite simply scrapped."
"It is unreasonable for the rich EU to force out poor farms in Africa through competition."
"A new free trade agreement would be the best way of taking the world out of financial crisis and preventing protectionism."
"The EU can and must act as a beacon for the liberalisation of world trade."
"Globalisation and international trade are fundamentally positive."
"Protectionism is an evil and has always been an evil."
"Those of you who believe that protectionism would teach and help the world in some way should learn from history."
"(PL) Madam President, one area in which we should look for ways to fight the crisis is the trade in agricultural products."
"In recent years, under pressure from the World Trade Organisation, we have introduced many voluntary restrictions on the production and export of agricultural products in the European Union."
"We carried out, for example, a huge reform of the sugar market, which reduced European sugar production by one third and closed down many sugar refineries."
"Many farms stopped growing sugar beet, we increased unemployment and did not achieve any social or economic benefits."
"It was a present for the big sugar concerns, which moved their production out of Europe, and today we import sugar from them."
"I think that during the crisis, we should give strong protection to our economy and our producers."
"I am not talking, here, about protectionism, but about a policy of equal opportunities which, at present, our producers do not have."
"A variety of high standards are in force in the European Union, for example, in agriculture there are standards for animal welfare."
"It is right to promote these standards, but we should also require that these same standards be met by those who export their products to the European Union."
"If, for example, we bring in a ban on battery hens, we should not at the same time import eggs from countries where this method is in use."
"We should act in a similar way on many other matters."
"We should observe a simple rule - the same requirements for exporters as for our own producers, because without this, apart from the economic crisis (...)."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SK) The financial crisis brought on by the US financial sector grew very quickly into an economic crisis which immediately affected all areas of economic life."
"The inevitable consequences were a rapid decline in consumer spending power, a decline in output, higher unemployment, lower fiscal revenues and less money to finance state budgets."
"As output fell all over the world, of course, the value of goods traded necessarily had to drop with the decline in production."
"If, therefore, we are now asking how to achieve stability or even growth in the volume of global trade, ladies and gentlemen, it can only be through effective measures for halting economic collapse, through measures for stabilising the economy and through the gradual start-up of economic growth."
"The current economic system is so interlinked and globalised that, in my view, it is a worthless illusion to rely on limited artificial interventions that target specific sectors and produce no added value."
"(BG) Ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has inevitably led to a significant reduction in global trade volumes."
"This is also reflected in the drop in production and investment, as well as in limited growth opportunities."
"At the same time, national governments are strongly tempted to put up barriers to protect their domestic production capacities."
"In 2009, we observed an alarming increase in the various forms of national protection used, both in individual European Union Member States and in the new developing economies."
"This protectionism hampers access to international markets for small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of the European economy, adding a further burden and restrictions."
"In order to overcome these problems and encourage entrepreneurship and trade, I think that Europe needs, above all, a strong internal market."
"This can be achieved if the European economy is sufficiently competitive, innovative and based on high standards of quality."
"As also noted by the European Commission, in spite of the progress made, we must continue the efforts to increase the capacity of the educational systems as a contribution to an innovative, dynamic knowledge society."
"In my view, stable public finances in the European Union, which will guarantee the sustainability of the national economies and the European currency, are an important prerequisite for overcoming the trade imbalances."
"The euro's stability is of paramount importance to the trust of our trade partners."
"A further boost to reviving trade and investment is also provided by the timely implementation of the necessary structural reforms aimed at laying new stable foundations for growth."
"Last but not least in terms of importance, I believe that the internal market would also be strengthened by the prudent and prompt expansion of the euro area, which will result in the economic integration of European states and make the European economy even more influential in relation to its international partners."
"(ES) Madam President, as the 2009 figures show, and as has already been indicated, the financial crisis which broke out at the beginning of 2008 has considerably reduced trading figures."
"In any case, it seems that we have managed to avoid the serious temptation of protectionism which occurred during the crisis of the 1930s, and it seems that the trend for the emergence of new restrictive measures disappeared at the end of last year."
"This is demonstrated in the Fifth report on potentially trade restrictive measures adopted by the Commission at the end of last year."
"Nevertheless, many countries have adopted these restrictive measures, countries with different economic bases such as the United States, China, Argentina, Russia and Indonesia, but also many developing countries."
"And it is these countries, the developing countries, which need open markets that can receive their products."
"For that reason, I call on Mr De Gucht, in his capacity as Development Commissioner, to work towards broader and freer trade in the world, towards the European Union taking the lead in reducing protectionist barriers in developed countries and to work towards a greater commitment to taking development into consideration in trade negotiations."
"(EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider that the reduction in world trade has gone well beyond the boundaries of the recession itself."
"Studies have shown that the lack of financing for trade by the banks is due in large part to the slowdown in commerce."
"I should like to ask two questions: firstly, what has become of international commitments on the multilateral financing of trade?"
"And secondly, what results has the more flexible financing framework to facilitate access by undertakings to financing at European level had?"
"Moving on to global trade, I should like to point out that the rules, disciplines and commitments of the World Trade Organisation have, to a large degree, prevented the use of restrictive trade measures, at the same time providing the flexibility to adopt policies aimed at economic recovery."
"However, we call on the Commission to closely monitor the measures adopted by our trading partners and their impact on European exports, including the 'buy national' policies applied by important EU trading partners."
"At the same time, we must not overlook the dynamic increase in exports by certain emerging economies."
"In the present case, I should like to underline in particular the issue of the competitiveness of European products on global markets, which existed before and exist independently of the economic crisis."
"Finally, what we need, among other things, is to achieve reciprocity with our trading partners in terms of market access, restore terms of fair competition on the international markets and ensure that imported products are subject to the same rules as goods produced within the EU."
"Madam President, (inaudible) is in a very difficult situation already because of the global recession and the decreasing demand for a number of products worldwide."
"However, protectionism further hurts international trade and the EU's interests directly."
"One of the international trade actors which have enacted additional and counterproductive trade barriers is Russia."
"Since the beginning of the financial crisis, Russia has imposed a number of so-called 'temporary' anti-crisis tariffs on a number of imports, such as meat and milk products, furniture, and also some steel products."
"Another instance which may be recalled is the temporary tariff on drugs that Russia has imposed on EU exporters."
"What is even more alarming is that, on 1 January 2010, a customs union came into existence between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan."
"As a consequence, a total of 30% of the EU's product lines have seen increased tariffs."
"The main problem is, of course, that Russia, like Belarus and Kazakhstan, is not a member of the WTO, and is therefore not bound by the WTO rules restricting the unilateral increase of import tariffs and other trade-restrictive measures."
"Since Russia is not a member of the WTO, we do not have a dispute settlement mechanism with them."
"Commissioner, I have two questions for you."
"How does the Commission assess the current EU trade problems with Russia, and do we have a particular strategy on how to address the issue of Russia's membership of the WTO?"
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard on several occasions that world trade has declined dramatically over the last three months, despite the successful attempts by many members of the World Trade Organisation to keep the markets open as far as possible."
"I am also very grateful that the European Union has played a highly effective role in this respect and has introduced hardly any protectionist measures."
"In my country, there is a saying that attack is the best form of defence."
"I would like to pick up on what Mrs Andrikienhas just said about the specific measures that Russia has taken."
"We need to ask what effective options we have open to us that will allow us to go on the offensive against those trading partners who have not kept to the agreements made in the G20, who have introduced protectionist measures, who have closed the markets and who have helped to bring about an even greater fall in worldwide economic performance than would otherwise have been the case."
"Should we not make more proactive use of our Global Europe strategy and forcefully implement the points it contains?"
"Is it not now the right time to address our interests proactively instead of simply preventing protectionism?"
"I have in mind a possible new initiative which will allow us to make progress within the WTO at last."
"I think we should take the logical step of negotiating free trade agreements quickly."
"We have one result in South Korea."
"However, what has happened with regard to India, Canada, Colombia and Peru?"
"Would we not be sending out a very positive signal if we could make progress on these free trade agreements now?"
"Many other Members have referred to the developing countries."
"Is this not the ideal opportunity to bring about some progress at last in the Economic Partnership Agreements so that the developing countries and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries (ACP) could be better integrated into world trade and so that effective measures could be taken to bring about economic growth and combat poverty?"
"Over recent decades, it has become clear that the states which have taken part in world trade have had the highest levels of growth."
"I look forward to hearing your answer, Mr De Gucht."
"(EL) Madam President, my first comment is that the correlations in our trade relations with rapidly emerging countries are not static."
"When, for example, there are completely different growth rates between the Union and China, the non-tariff obstacles applied against us, which we considered to be of lesser importance when the Chinese economy was smaller, are having worse and worse results for us as China's relative importance increases and ours decreases."
"At the same time, as our relative size decreases, our negotiating power decreases as well."
"There is therefore a window of opportunity through which the Union can impose its policy and effectively reduce obstacles to our exports in rapidly emerging economies and limit social and environmental dumping."
"Time is working against us, even more than before as a result of the crisis."
"My second comment is that, as the correlations change, the importance of trans-Atlantic trade relations and of promoting a more functional American market which will increase trans-Atlantic trade and give the parties on either side of the Atlantic greater negotiating power increases."
"Here, too, there is a window of opportunity, as it will take time to build up the trans-Atlantic market, because it is a complex process."
"How does the US rate the importance of these relations?"
"Unfortunately, the fact that President Obama will not be attending the forthcoming summit in Madrid is not an encouraging sign."
"The question is: does the Commission feel the need for urgent action, while we still have the necessary negotiating power?"
"(FR) Madam President, the economic and financial storm we have just gone through has caused a lot of damage."
"Our economies are disoriented, and we are still struggling today to get back on an even keel in the face of determined emerging powers."
"It is now time, European Commissioner, for you to captain an ambitious and meaningful European trade policy that is unapologetically aimed at defending our commercial interests and based on mutual openness of the markets and on the exploitation of our competitive advantages."
"The European Union must first of all find a happy medium between ultra-free trade and protectionism."
"To my mind, this third way must be embodied by the creation of a fair trade framework."
"The European Union is armed with certain values: respect for the protection of intellectual property, fairness in terms of investments, access to markets, the fight against non-tariff trade barriers and respect for social and environmental standards."
"Consequently, it has a duty to ensure that these values are accepted as principles by India and China, emerging countries which are not only our customers and competitors, but also our partners."
"Apart from the need to establish balanced trade, you must, Commissioner, help to boost the competitiveness of our European companies."
"How can this be achieved?"
"Innovation, investment in research and development, and the international influence of competitive clusters seem to be some of the key factors that will get us out of the crisis."
"We also need to focus our actions on innovative companies, especially SMEs, by relieving them of any excessive administrative and fiscal burdens, and on green technologies and services."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) We must face up to the fundamental question of whether free trade, the current system controlled by the WTO, is good for the people, or whether we should be contemplating a new guiding principle, which I would rather not call protectionism but economic self-determination?"
"I would like to propose looking at the differences between these two guiding principles in three areas."
"What does global world trade mean in its current form and volume in terms of creating and preserving jobs in Europe, especially when we think about small traders, SMEs, family businesses and small farms in European countries, which are adrift and have lost opportunities to progress because of the current global, liberalised world trade?"
"If we think of solidarity, is it good for the poor, developing countries that, instead of developing their own agriculture and industry, they are obliged to open their markets?"
"Is it good for the environment that goods are delivered from great distances?"
"I would like to propose that as an initial step, at least with regard to agriculture and food, we contemplate the introduction of the principle of food self-determination, which means that communities and countries have the right to decide what they want to produce and how they want to produce it, and then how they want to sell it."
"Consumers are entitled to quality, healthy and nutritious food, and we know that this is not the food that has been shipped from thousands of kilometres away, but the locally produced, locally processed and locally sold food."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on his new appointment."
"Could he, if possible, give some details about the effects of the economic crisis on world trade in agricultural products?"
"Mrs Andrikienhas already mentioned the case of the Russian Federation, which announced that it is prepared to ban poultry meat imports until 2015, because it covers its requirements from domestic production."
"Given that the promotion of a more competitive agricultural system in an open global trade environment is one of the duties assigned by President Barroso to the new Commissioner for Agriculture, I am going to take advantage of the commissioner's presence in the Chamber to ask him how he views the cooperation with his colleague responsible for agriculture in terms of concluding the negotiations as part of the Doha Round."
"Madam President, firstly, I want to say that the Commission is to be congratulated on rejecting a recent proposal by the WHO that we should ban the sale of duty-free alcohol and spirits."
"If this was accepted, it would have cost EUR 2 billion to the European economy and hundreds of jobs across the Union."
"It was a notion based on moralistic preaching rather than on scientific evidence by the WHO and, thankfully, it was rejected by the Commission."
"The second point I want to make is that the banks were primarily responsible for many of the ills which we are seeing nowadays, but what happened?"
"A new theory came into being - they were too big to fail."
"I think, rather than be too big to fail, many of them are too big for their own boots."
"That is seen in the immoral salaries that some of them are getting and the grotesque bonuses they are also getting."
"No banker should be getting more than the Prime Minister of his country, and we should work towards..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) Madam President, international trade, alongside the financial sector, is the area of the world economy which has suffered most as a result of the economic crisis."
"It is estimated that world trade turnover fell last year by around 10% as a result of the crisis."
"In addition, the policy of protectionism adopted by many countries as a basic tool for fighting the recession is having a disadvantageous effect on trade."
"The advantages of free trade in a global economy ought not to need explaining to anyone."
"It is safe to say that the prosperity which free-market countries achieved in the second half of the 20th century was, in large measure, the fruit of free trade, which developed dynamically in this period."
"The fall in world trade, the rise in unemployment, especially in developing countries and, with this, the growth of poverty and social exclusion - this adverse trend can be stopped by restoring dynamic trade on fair and just (...)."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as commissioner."
"We are pleased to see such an astute and successful politician and a well-known Liberal on the Commission."
"You will need all your powers of persuasion to bring a new impetus to international trade policy in the EU."
"We must fight against any protectionist tendencies."
"History clearly shows that countries which have taken part in world trade have enjoyed better growth than those which did not."
"We are also facing a new world order."
"Some of the players involved, for example, China, have State capitalist systems, but may be using quite different methods in this arena."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission to develop a new strategy for world trade."
"It is clear that we must move forward with the Doha development round, because a multilateral approach is the right one."
"However, we will need all our efforts to make progress in relation to China."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to pick up on a subject which two other speakers have mentioned."
"Mr De Gucht, fortunately you are also responsible for the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC)."
"I would be very grateful if you could put the TEC right at the top of your agenda, with the aim of solving all the problems that we have referred to."
"It is still the case that Europe and the US are responsible for almost 60% of global economic performance."
"If we could manage to remove only a fraction of the trade barriers on the transatlantic market, we could do much more for our citizens and, of course, for employees than has been achieved by many of the other measures that we have put far more effort into over the last five years."
"I would be very grateful if you could devote your attention to the TEC."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, if I were to try to give a balanced answer to all the questions that have been put and to all the matters that have been raised, I would need, I think, at least half an hour."
"I have only two or three minutes if I understand rightly."
"Having said this, let me start with a general remark."
"I really do not believe that protectionism is a solution."
"Whether you are a believer or not, looking back into history, it is thanks to international trade that our countries have become prosperous."
"Secondly, Europe has a transformative economy, which means that we have to import to be able to export."
"The idea that we could export without importing is completely false and contradictory to the facts."
"So I staunchly believe that we should have free trade agreements with major economic partners, that we should make a success of the Doha Round and that we should further liberalise international trade, but that does not mean that we should not take into account the fact that this international trade also has to be fair and that we are entitled to protect our interests."
"The Commission is certainly going to do so when necessary and we will use the TDI mechanisms we have to have an impact on what we consider to be unfair distortions of trade."
"Some very specific questions have also been asked, by Mr Jadot, for example, on the meeting on 4 February at the WTO and what the result of this was."
"Well, the main message at that meeting was that the rules of the General Agreement on Trade in Services are not an obstacle to the right of countries to ensure effective financial regulation."
"The reason is that GATS has a very broad scope for financial prudential measures, so this financial regulation, be it at national or European level, is certainly not contradictory to the GATS rules."
"That brings me to the origins of the crisis we are going through."
"Hopefully, the major part is behind us."
"I am firmly convinced that it has had a major impact on trade, but that the origin of this crisis lies with financial imbalances which resulted from completely wrong choices by financial institutions."
"The financial crisis did not originate in Europe; it came to Europe and to the rest of the world from the United States."
"I can agree that the food crisis of a couple of years ago, which was still not completely resolved and digested, let us say, has added to big imbalances, especially for the developing countries."
"You can say a lot about developing countries, about good governance and so on, but you certainly cannot lay the blame on the developing countries for being at the origin of the financial crisis."
"That is obvious, and they are very severely hit by that crisis, so we should take that into due consideration."
"There have also been some questions, the last time by Mr Caspary and one by Mr Jadot too, asking what are we going to do with the TEC and with the strategic initiative for China?"
"My personal opinion is that the only good response to the economic development of China - which we are not going to stop, by the way - the only good response is to become stronger ourselves."
"I think that is the only good response."
"When you look at this in terms of trade deficit, it is true that the trade deficit with China has gone up considerably, but when you look at the global trade deficit with Asia, this did not go up that much."
"Also, within Asia, the other Asian countries are facing very fierce competition from China."
"So what we should do is become stronger ourselves."
"I believe that achieving this transatlantic marketplace, for example, is one of the best answers we can give."
"We have a recent report, produced at the request of Parliament, which shows that, if you were able to reduce by 50% the non-tariff barriers between Europe and the United States, this would have an effect which would be much larger than the Doha Round."
"We should work on that, but, having said this, it is not easy at all."
"Speaking of the Doha Round, I staunchly believe that we should try to close that round because it has a lot of important features, among them, that the existing tariffs cannot go up any more, that we would be able to close them down."
"Secondly, there is a strong developmental approach in the Doha Round, provided, of course, that we can keep it as it stands now, and that should be the goal of the European Commission."
"There was also the question by David Martin on the Robin Hood tax."
"First of all, I must say that I like the name Robin Hood much better than Tobin."
"But apart from that, I fear the Robin Hood tax is facing the same problems as the Tobin tax, that you can only do it if it happens on a global scale."
"You should also bear in mind that doing this, even on a global scale, would imply a very costly implementing mechanism to put it into place."
"President Barroso said about the Tobin tax that we are ready to support it as long as everybody else does, and that, of course, is the sticking point in all this."
"A last word on - Mr Higgins, amongst others, asked a question - speculation and what came about from that, and also with respect to Greece."
"This is not a debate on Greece so I am not going to go into the details of it, but I think, sincerely speaking, that some fault also lies with Greece itself."
"What you cannot have in a global economy, and what you cannot have in the European Union either, is moral hazard."
"Being a Member State of the European Union also implies some obligations."
"So Member States who get into a difficult position - and certainly we are ready to support them and help them whenever possible - should also realise that they have to obey the rules and if they obey the rules, then probably they will not get into the difficult situation they are in now."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (HU) The shrinking of world trade has had a particularly detrimental effect on the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as the drop in demand primarily affected products which have played a significant role in exports, such as cars, consumer electronics, and so on. At the same time, these countries have also been hit hard by the credit crunch."
"Boosting exports would be extremely important to ensure that these countries are able to recover from the difficulties arising from this double pressure and the resultant social problems, such as growing unemployment."
"Financing for exporters seems to be a major obstacle in this area, as payment periods have become longer, credit has become more expensive and more difficult to access, while credit insurance conditions have also deteriorated."
"This is why programmes should be developed targeting the countries in question, especially EU Member States, to assist them in overcoming these difficulties."
"The trend for outsourcing in the 1990s has led to capital and also expertise being transferred abroad within the world economy."
"The fact that jobs have been and are being created in countries with low wages has resulted in average wages falling in Central and Western Europe, which, in its turn, has caused a fall in consumption levels."
"The consequence of this is that European companies are no longer making the majority of their profits from producing goods, which is their core business."
"They are attempting to improve their results by means of financial transactions and speculation."
"This is the point at which we must start."
"We need to impose a quota on how much ordinary share capital companies can invest in stocks and shares and also on how much of their reserves they can deposit in financial packages in third countries."
"Secondly, we need regulations for the companies that have suffered damage as a result of the crisis."
"Thirdly, the economy requires not only fresh capital for the banks, which were one of the main causes of the crisis, but also and, more importantly, new regulations for money transfers, strict guidelines on the sale of credit packages and an independent supervisory body for the new and flourishing trading business, which includes areas such as short selling, that should be banned."
"If the forecasts presented just now by Mr Moreira are right, then the predicted decline in world trade will be the biggest since the Second World War."
"It goes without saying that both Member States of the European Union and countries which do not belong to the Community are taking measures to increase competitiveness and overcome the effects of the crisis."
"Research carried out by the Centre of Economic Policy Research has shown that since the first meeting of the Group of Twenty devoted to the crisis, 425 legislative initiatives have been undertaken to combat the effects of the crisis."
"Some countries have resorted to protectionist practices, while others are trying to liberalise trade."
"In view of the fact that the economy is a system of connected vessels, is the European Commission monitoring legislative initiatives being undertaken both within the European Union and around the world?"
"Does the European Commission, when taking anti-crisis measures, take these into account?"
"As protectionist and liberalising measures accumulate, a situation will arise in which they are mutually exclusive and will have no effect on world trade."
"EU - South Korea free trade agreement (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission by Daniel Caspary, Peter Å Å¥astnÃ½, PaweÅ Zalewski, David Martin, Gianluca Susta, Kader Arif, Michael Theurer, NiccolÃ² Rinaldi, Metin Kazak, Marielle De Sarnez and Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the European Conservatives and Reformists, on the free trade agreement between the EU and South Korea - B7-0001/2010)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the negotiations on the agreement with South Korea have been completed and the documents have been initialled."
"That is a very good thing."
"However, if we look at the details of the agreement, it seems as if speed took precedence over thoroughness."
"I have the impression that your predecessor wanted the agreement to be signed and sealed at any price, so that she had at least one success during her period of office."
"We are familiar with the many expert reports which were drawn up before the start of negotiations and which clearly indicated the many possible benefits for European industry and the European economy."
"There is likely to be a positive impact on the mechanical engineering, chemical, pharmaceutical, food and service industries."
"All of these sectors and many others hope to gain major benefits from the agreement."
"However, the main protests are coming from the car industry."
"There are difficulties with the duty drawback system, with the question of the amount of parts from foreign suppliers that can be used in cars from South Korea and with the issue of environmental standards which remain unresolved."
"I would like to see us not only addressing but resolving many of these criticisms over the next few months using the safeguard mechanisms and the safeguard regulation."
"The Members of this House can only vote in favour of this free trade agreement if we have dealt with the justified concerns of the car industry and can also incorporate genuinely effective solutions into these safeguard mechanisms."
"The text of the safeguard mechanisms was published on the Internet today, but unfortunately, I have not yet had a chance to read it."
"I would like to offer you the opportunity on behalf of my group to work with us in partnership to develop a suitable regulation at a European level, in order to ensure that the interests of the car industry are addressed in this free trade agreement."
"author. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, new players have emerged out of the wings onto the world stage, some of which were actually considered developing countries not long ago."
"This must change our approach, cultural and otherwise, towards free trade and the tangible manifestations of the relationship between the European Union and its major competitors."
"This relationship is currently mediated by certain magic terms that have not yet entered into the vocabulary of the European Commission."
"These terms are reciprocity, European interest, the fight against dumping and the fight against tariff barriers."
"This is the background to the free trade agreement with Korea, which incidentally confused two Commissioners - the Commissioner for Internal Market and Services and the Commissioner for Employment - and some governments."
"What are the real advantages of this bilateral agreement, when 50% of the trade between the European Union and Korea concerns the automotive sector, when the disparity between the 700 000 Korean cars exported to us as opposed to the 27 000 European cars imported by Korea is glaringly evident?"
"What is the sense in providing indirect aid of approximately EUR 1 600 for each Korean car sold in Europe when some European governments find it difficult to provide incentives for buying and selling cars to stimulate consumption?"
"How can we also fail to take into account the serious doubts over the textile and electronics industries?"
"We will not settle with hearing for the umpteenth time, Commissioner, as Mrs Ashton said before you, that there are advantages for our chemical, pharmaceutical or agrifood industries because these pale scandalously into insignificance compared to the consequences for textiles, electronics and, above all, for cars, or financial services."
"Could it be that Europe, even with the crisis we are in today, is yet again choosing the financial option for its development?"
"We all welcomed the birth of the new Europe in Lisbon with hope."
"Europe cannot however, fail to take responsibility for European interests in the world, particularly today."
"The United States is jumping through hoops to defend Boeing against Airbus and the Argentinean Government is threatening to expropriate Telecom."
"The agreement with Korea actually legitimises pass-through financing with China which, until now, was illegal."
"This is the scenario in which our major businesses are forced to operate."
"Behind them are hundreds of thousands of workers, of families who can see their future going up in smoke, not because they are producing poor quality services or goods but because poorly defined interests are allowed to prevail over more evident and objective interests."
"We trust in your sensitivity, Commissioner, in the hope that you will avoid over-hasty ratifications, which could go hand in hand with unacceptable decisions over the provisional application of the commercial side of the agreement pending ratification, or at least decisions that will be unacceptable until the regulation on the bilateral safeguard clause has been clearly defined."
"The adoption of this clause is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure that should be considered a first step to any appraisal of the advisability ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"author. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon is opening a new chapter in the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"The right of codecision of the European Parliament that has been directly elected by the citizens of Europe gives us the opportunity to bring democracy back into decisions on trade policy."
"This is the right thing to do, because it will have consequences for employees and consumers in the Member States."
"Free and fair trade forms the basis for Europe's prosperity."
"We must therefore firmly oppose any protectionist tendencies."
"Free trade agreements like this one with South Korea can make an important contribution to stimulating world trade, growth and employment."
"However, it is in the nature of agreements of this kind, that, depending on their specific structure, they bring more benefits for some sectors of industry than for others."
"It is our job in Parliament to weigh up carefully the impact on different industries and sectors within the EU."
"In order to do this, we need the relevant data and impact assessments and it is the Commission's task to provide them."
"However, despite many requests from the committee and in the plenary session, we have not yet received data which we believe to be satisfactory."
"This is the reason why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has joined with other groups to ask this question."
"According to the information that we have received so far, the agreement offers opportunities for the service, mechanical engineering and plant construction, chemical and agricultural industries in the European economy."
"However, the concern is that the agreement will have a negative impact on the car industry and the textile and electronics sectors."
"The free trade agreement with South Korea is the only agreement with a developed country which does not include a ban on duty drawbacks."
"This may lead to one-sided cost benefits for South Korean industry."
"As the Commission has assured us on several occasions, the provisions on the duty drawback include a safeguard clause, which allows for a waiver on the basis of certain criteria."
"However, we urgently need to clarify this in the interests of the companies involved."
"The system must be applicable in practice."
"It must not be the case that the safeguard clauses are worthless because the companies cannot provide the necessary proof."
"As the agreement seems to contain one-sided regulations and as it sets a precedent for future agreements, for example, with India or with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, we feel that the specific wording of the safeguard clauses, the procedure for settling disputes and the other regulations relating to the application of the agreement are of central importance."
"We are therefore calling on the Commission to submit the free trade agreement together with the provisions on its application to Parliament for approval."
"We want a decision quickly."
"For this reason, a provisional version of the agreement must not be allowed to come into force."
"I know from discussions with companies what an important impact the implementation has."
"Therefore, my question to the Commission is as follows: Will the development of the European External Action Service lead to it playing a stronger role in trade policy?"
"In our opinion, at least, this should be included."
"author. - Madam President, during times of economic downturn, it is only through the opening-up of markets and the removal of barriers that we can rebuild our industry, create jobs and boost development."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your points of view on the previous debate."
"EU exporters of consumer goods, electronics, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and medical devices are just some of the sectors which will benefit immensely from the removal of non-tariff barriers."
"Simplification of certification procedures, transparency and price predictability are all things that will benefit the consumer."
"The Korean consumer market, in turn, wants access to speciality European agricultural products, such as wines, spirits, meats, cheeses, all protected by geographical indicators."
"However, it would be wrong to accept this free trade agreement - and we have heard many people speak on it - at face value, and there are areas which need further clarification by the Commission."
"The inclusion of duty drawback clauses has been a concern for many of us, as I mentioned."
"Any free trade agreement must be based on the principle of reciprocity or mutual benefit, but the potential burden on European car manufacturers remains unclear and of great concern to us."
"The Commission has assured us that Korea is actively liberalising its import regime."
"The level of duties that Korea can refund under the duty drawback are gradually being reduced."
"The negotiators are convinced that the economic relevance of the duty drawback will therefore diminish over time."
"What evidence does the Commission have to support this argument?"
"If the Commission finds itself resorting to repeated or continued use of this safeguard mechanism, will it consider reviewing negotiations to extend the transfer period?"
"Commissioner, I look forward to working closely with you in the new agreement that is coming up."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their oral question, which confirms the interest of the European Parliament in the EU-South Korea free trade agreement."
"As this will be the first major trade agreement to which the European Parliament will be asked to give its formal consent under the Lisbon Treaty, I very much welcome this opportunity to reply to the many aspects of the free trade agreement raised in the oral question."
"I might not be able to give detailed replies to all aspects of the question, but I am happy to address them in a possible follow-up question."
"The EU-South Korea agreement is not only the first FTA negotiated by the EU with a country in Asia; it is also the most ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement ever negotiated by the European Union."
"After more than two years of negotiations, the free trade agreement was initialled on 15 October last year."
"Throughout the negotiating process, the Commission remained in close contact with Parliament."
"In this respect, the Commission welcomes the resolution on Korea voted by Parliament in December 2007."
"Many of the issues raised in this resolution have been addressed in the free trade agreement."
"The whole process was also accompanied by a constant dialogue with civil society and a comprehensive trade sustainable impact assessment."
"The FTA is currently being translated."
"By the end of March, the Commission envisages presenting to the Council the decisions to authorise the signature of the FTA as well as to conclude the FTA."
"The objective is to sign the agreement in April."
"The Commission is currently completing its analysis as to whether the agreement also falls within the competence of Member States."
"In this case, the FTA would require the ratification of all Member States before formally entering into force."
"As this process may take some time, it may be necessary for the Commission to propose that the agreement be provisionally applied pending its entry into force."
"The provisional application is decided by the Council on a proposal by the Commission."
"The Commission is sensitive to the desire of Parliament to be able to give its views on the FTA before it is provisionally applied."
"The Commission will continue to seek out the best means, together with the Council and Parliament, to ensure that this takes place in a manner that does not cause unnecessary delays."
"It is of great importance that we apply the agreement as soon as is feasible."
"As regards the regulation on safeguards, the Commission intends to present its proposal for such a regulation to the Council and the European Parliament in the coming weeks, and hopes that it will be possible to adopt this legislation rapidly so as to ensure that its application takes place as close as possible to the application of the FTA."
"The economic benefits of the FTA are mostly in the EU's favour."
"It will relieve EU exporters of industrial and agricultural goods from Korean tariffs, saving them EUR 1.6 billion in duties annually, half of these directly from the day of the entry into force of the agreement."
"Obviously, potential gains from these duty savings will be even higher, as trade between the EU and Korea is expected to expand over time."
"According to one study, the FTA will create substantial new trade in goods and services of 19.1 billion for the EU compared to 12.8 billion for Korea."
"Existing studies have not identified any sectors that would be negatively affected by the FTA, but in case of serious injury or threat thereof, the Commission would not hesitate to activate the safeguard procedures built into the agreement."
"Let me also remind you that, in the event of such a necessity, we have the possibility of employing the support measures under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"With regard to intellectual property rights, the FTA contains ambitious commitments going beyond WTO rules."
"Besides, the Commission has been careful to ensure that no element in the FTA contradicts the EU acquis communautaire."
"On the implications of the protocol on cultural cooperation, the FTA would set a framework for engaging in policy dialogue on cooperating and facilitating exchanges regarding cultural activities."
"It is, above all, a demonstration of the EU's commitment to actively promoting the 2005 UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expression."
"On rules of origin, the negotiations with South Korea resulted in a number of changes which are consistent with the ongoing process of reform of such rules."
"These changes go in the direction of simplification, thus implementing a specific request by the European Parliament."
"At the same time, strict rules have been maintained for all sensitive sectors."
"The Commission has paid particular attention to creating a new market-access opportunity in Korea for European fruit and vegetables."
"In order to encourage Korea to open up its market, European Union entry prices have been eliminated except in the case of the three most sensitive products: tomatoes, oranges and Korean citrus."
"Obviously, the FTA also opens the EU market to Korean products."
"To protect our industry against import increases causing or threatening injury, the FTA contains an effective safeguard mechanism."
"This safeguard clause can be invoked from the entry into force of the FTA."
"The Commission will monitor the EU market and Korean imports to assess the need to invoke the safeguard clause, and remains committed to making use of it if conditions are met."
"The same applies to the special clause on duty drawback, which can be invoked based on publicly available trade statistics on imports into and exports from Korea."
"I am aware of certain concerns expressed, notably by the EU car industry, about the duty drawback provisions in the FTA, but I have to emphasise that duty drawback is currently allowed and used by Koreans as well as by EU exporters."
"Thus, maintaining it in the FTA does not accrue any new benefit."
"The current economic impact of duty drawback is very small, about one eighth of the value of the Korean duty concessions."
"In the case of cars, available studies show that, on average, the foreign content of Korean cars is between 10% and 15%."
"If foreign sourcing were to increase significantly, the special clause on duty drawback would provide for an effective remedy."
"It cannot be ruled out that implementation of the FTA may give rise to different views and interpretation between the parties."
"To address such situations, the FTA contains an efficient and rapid dispute settlement mechanism."
"The Commission will monitor closely the implementation of commitments by Korea and will not hesitate to invoke dispute settlement procedures if warranted."
"The FTA would also break new ground in promoting the protection of the environment and respect for labour rights, containing comprehensive commitments on a range of social and environmental standards."
"The scope of these commitments is broader than that of any comparable agreement."
"To ensure that these commitments are respected, the FTA establishes a strong framework for monitoring their implementation, involving civil society, business, trade unions and NGOs."
"Finally, I would like to inform you that Korea and the EU have been discussing possible adjustments to the tariff dismantlement schedule."
"These adjustments would imply, inter alia, that products classified under three years and five years would be subject to four- and six-year tariff cuts respectively, so that duties would be eliminated one year later than originally scheduled."
"While this implies a modest sacrifice in terms of our offensive interests, we thought that such an adjustment would be appropriate, taking into account the sensitivities of certain sectors."
"Korea has indicated its readiness to agree to those changes on the basis that the sensitivities of both sides are equally respected."
"Commissioner, first of, I would like to wish you the best of luck in your new role."
"We find ourselves in economically tricky times, but we know that you are not afraid of them."
"In relation to this free trade agreement with South Korea, as you say, there are undoubtedly many positives for Europe in this agreement, but for our car-making industry, it is, and remains, a disastrous agreement."
"Mr Caspary also made this point."
"Just take a look at the figures, Commissioner."
"For every car that we export to South Korea from Europe, 15 come the other way."
"We currently have a ratio of 15:1, and that is primarily the result of non-tariff barriers to trade in South Korea."
"It is also no coincidence that a manufacturer such as General Motors should reverse its decision to build the new, small SUV in Europe, specifically in its Antwerp factory, and instead move the entire project to South Korea."
"This forthcoming free trade agreement with South Korea is the direct cause of this decision."
"I do not think, Commissioner, that we can accept that, and just sweep it under the carpet by arguing that many other sectors in Europe will benefit."
"I believe that we still have plenty of time to adapt this situation for our automotive sector, and you were quite right to refer to the safeguard clause."
"I accept that such safeguarding measures exist, but we are asking, first and foremost, for there to be a fundamental review of the impact of this agreement on the automotive sector."
"The numbers and the trends are much too alarming."
"The reality, in any case - and you know this better than I do - is that the US Government is currently negotiating with the South Koreans about making adaptations to a similar agreement that they have."
"Do not forget, Mr De Gucht, that the car industry is still Europe's most important industrial sector."
"We are talking about an awful lot of jobs, here, that are under severe pressure at the moment."
"In my opinion, we must not allow more jobs to be put on the line and we therefore urgently ask you to build additional guarantees into this agreement."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I believe that this Korean free trade agreement is important for three reasons."
"Firstly, as you have indicated, it is a win-win deal for Korea and for the European Union economies."
"It is good for consumers, it is good for jobs and, as you rightly say, it has a potential to add 19 billion to our trade flows with Korea."
"Secondly though, given the debate we have just had, in the context of the current global financial crisis, it sets a very positive example."
"If two large economies like the European Union and Korea can agree a free trade agreement, it sets an impetus for other partners."
"Japan, for example, is showing much more interest in economic relations with the European Union than it was just a few years ago and partly that is due to the Korean deal."
"Suddenly, on the other side, the Koreans are finding the US is now coming back, knocking on their door, wanting to get the KORUS agreement moving again."
"The third reason - more parochially, but I hope colleagues in the House will bear this in mind - is that it is important for Parliament because many of the demands we made in my report have been met by the Commission, and time does not permit me to go through them all but I want to just give you three or four examples."
"Firstly, we said in my report that we needed much better access to the Korean agricultural market."
"Well, Korean agricultural tariffs are going to come down by 75% over the first seven years of this agreement; we wanted our geographical indicators protected, our Whisky, our Champagnes, our wines, our hams and so on are going to be protected in Korea as a result of this agreement."
"And they are not, as one of my colleagues indicated, insignificant."
"Scottish whisky sells GBP 137 million worth a year into the Korean market already so with this deal, we could see a significant increase."
"We called for non-tariff barriers to be tackled and this will be of particular benefit to the automobile industry."
"We wanted improved trade in environmental goods."
"Well, under this deal, environmental trade in goods and services will, after three years, have virtually duty-free access to the Korean market and their environmental goods and services duty-free access to our market."
"We asked as a Parliament for improved social and environmental standards."
"Well, Korea, since the negotiations have been initialled, has signed four ILO Conventions and their trade and sustainable development forum is going to be established as a result of this agreement allowing the civil partners in Korea to ensure that greater market opening is accompanied by labour and environmental standards improvements."
"All of these things, Parliament asked for."
"It would be ludicrous and perverse for us to turn our back on them, having achieved them."
"Is this a perfect deal?"
"Well, of course it is not."
"Are there things in it that I would not want in it, of course there are, but negotiations mean that you have to come and go, but on balance, is it a good deal for Europe?"
"Yes."
"Is it a good deal for Korea?"
"Yes."
"Is it a good deal, potentially, for the world economy?"
"Yes."
"So we should not shilly-shally on this: we should get on and sign it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a classic subject on which European institutions are staking their reputation with industrialists, with workers and with European consumers."
"A free trade agreement is always good news, a cornerstone for stability and a cornerstone for the prosperity of the planet, all the more so when it represents the first successful bilateral trade policy for the European Union after years of disappointments."
"Perhaps, however, for this very reason, there has been a certain amount of haste in sealing the agreement."
"It is almost as though the Commission were tempted to close the deal at any cost."
"For us in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, although the duty drawback is acceptable for the WTO, even though it is already practised, it is effectively an export subsidy and a slackening of the rule of origin is a step backwards as far as transparency is concerned."
"These two principles will soon constitute a precedent for our other trade partners."
"We know that the Commission has driven a hard bargain, but, in the words of the Korean proverb, 'even the best make mistakes'."
"We have often heard that the Commission is losing its ability to safeguard the legitimate interests of producers, workers and consumers and something certainly went wrong in its communication with both sides of industry in a negotiation that was sometimes criticised for its lack of transparency."
"Every European citizen expects all of us, Commission and Parliament, to demonstrate political sensitivity."
"European industry is not doing well and it is pointless for some Member States to grant the automotive sector subsidies, which I am incidentally totally opposed to."
"On the other hand, with this agreement, we risk introducing subsidies for Korean exports."
"We all know that these agreements are complicated and that there are also many benefits to be welcomed: the end of Korean customs duties, the recognition of European certifications, new possibilities for European services, the protection of geographical indications."
"Partly for this reason, I have no wish to go down the same road as in the United States, where an agreement with Korea has been awaiting ratification for years and where some even want to re-open the automotive chapter."
"This is the Commission's demand: the text of the agreement must form part of an overall package made up of three documents, in other words, the free trade agreement to be submitted for ratification, the implementing measures, particularly with regard to duty drawback, and the regulation on the safeguard clause."
"If possible, I would also add the option of access to the global adjustment fund for areas that may be affected by this agreement."
"Commissioner, we wish to see all the documents together and we consider, above all, under the ordinary legislative procedure established by the Lisbon Treaty, that we should rule out any kind of interim agreement, which we would oppose because we want to work together."
"Mr President, as you said, this agreement breaks new ground."
"It breaks new ground, but not necessarily in the way in which we talk about it."
"Perhaps for the first time, in fact, we see in the outcome of the negotiations that there are losers, which one accepts, but within the context of trade negotiations with third parties."
"It is not within the context of the Lisbon Strategy, it is not within the context of an industrial policy that it was decided who, in Europe, would lose out in an open trade relationship."
"Secondly, this agreement also breaks new ground because, in trade negotiations, it is usually the farming sectors that resist and the industrial sectors that are satisfied."
"In this case, we see that the opposite is true."
"For the first time, it is literally major industrial sectors that are complaining about the decisions made by Europe."
"Thirdly, this agreement also breaks new ground because you refer to a EUR 1.6 billion reduction in customs duties from which we will benefit on the Korean market."
"Just what do these figures mean, however?"
"I am an elected representative for the west of France region, and more specifically for Brittany."
"If you have visited Brittany, Mr De Gucht, you will know that, these days, green algae and ground water pollution associated with the intensification of pig farming are a huge problem."
"Now, we are told that we shall earn a small amount of money from pigs by trading with South Korea."
"The reality, in the region I represent, is that this intensification of pig farming leads to a loss of jobs, a loss of added value, a loss of tourism and, consequently, in my region, we are the losers in this agreement."
"Perhaps in your overall calculation, people gain from it, but in a region like mine, people lose."
"Lastly, this agreement again breaks new ground because, for the first time, an environmental derogation will be called for."
"We are continually told that Europe is the indisputable and undisputed leader in the fight against global climate change."
"The reality is that we are reduced to negotiating derogations with South Korea on CO2 emissions from cars because the automobile lobby has been very powerful in Europe when it comes to pushing back the deadlines for the introduction of restrictions on CO2 emissions and because now, it is obliged to obtain derogations abroad."
"We therefore clearly see once again that, when it comes to an industrial strategy, a strategy for our businesses and the choice of economy, it will be more the case that Europe suffers this agreement than that it shapes it."
"You have talked about the Lisbon Strategy, the green economy and innovation."
"I do not see in this agreement how this will be encouraged."
"Finally, your approach to discussing issues is often very balanced, but as soon as people start talking about taxes, all of a sudden ..."
"On the carbon border tax mentioned during your hearing and now on the Tobin tax, I bet you, Mr De Gucht, that before the end of your mandate, the Commission will have to speak out strongly on the Tobin tax because it is now an essential tool for regulating the financial markets."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all, can I take the opportunity of welcoming you, Commissioner, to your new post, and may you have a very successful term."
"Can I take the opportunity to say that it is good that we are having this debate here tonight and getting some things out in the open."
"The truth is that the negotiations have been long and protracted, and I certainly welcome the Commissioner's statement that he is hoping to bring this very shortly to an end."
"There will be enormous benefit to both Europe and Korea on the signing of this deal."
"I know there are concerns and I have listened to those concerns."
"We have heard them here tonight about the car industry."
"But, you know, I think if we are going to depend on the car industry - and we are going to totally defend it - then I think we are picking the wrong particular area in which to do this, and certainly General Motors would not be the most important in my area, as far as I would be concerned."
"I share these concerns and I share some of the real concerns held by many people, and I understand them."
"But I believe the opportunity outweighs that concern, and I think that, if we are always to be reticent, then I do not believe we will achieve anything."
"So we must look to the opportunities and take them, and not the negatives."
"We cannot forget that this deal also has a political content, because to the north of South Korea there is a very aggressive enemy, and I think we send out a message as well as to whom we support."
"So we must do all we can to break down the barriers that are in that particular region."
"The agreement will show our support for progress."
"I have had the opportunity to go there and I know the people in that area are very much inclined to go forward and to be progressive."
"There is clear and visible support for each other between the north and the south when you visit an area like Kaesong This, I believe, is a tremendous opportunity for us to move forward."
"Can I just simply ask the Commission: firstly, how would it comment on the provision of the dispute settlement mechanism and how will this operate in practice?"
"Specifically, how quickly will we be able to utilise this mechanism in the case of serious market disruption?"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, we have decried the disastrous consequence of the liberalisation of the global economy for many sectors of economic activity, particularly in some Member States and the regions that are most dependent on these sectors."
"We are talking about the destruction of productive activity and jobs, a serious impact on the capacity to create and distribute wealth, an increasing dependence on foreign markets, chronic and growing imbalances in trade; in short, economic and social breakdown."
"We are also talking about the attacks on workers' rights, social dumping, the ruination of millions of small producers and many small and medium-sized enterprises."
"These are consequences of the gradual liberalisation of international trade which their advocates cannot ignore."
"I recall here the clothing and textile industry, which is particularly pertinent to this agreement, and a study by the Directorate-General for Employment and the Eurofund, which presents scenarios for a decrease of 20 to 25% of Community jobs by 2020, while acknowledging a scenario where 50% of jobs in this sector would be lost."
"I also recall, however, sectors such as electronics and the component manufacturing industry in the automotive sector, already mentioned here."
"These complaints give rise to questions that continue to go unanswered."
"What measures will be taken to safeguard these sectors, doing more than mitigating the effects of getting rid of jobs?"
"What defence mechanisms and safeguards are there against aggressive exports?"
"When and how will we have a way of effectively tackling the relocation of businesses?"
"According to the proposal of this group, the budget for 2010 will provide a new budget heading for action in the textile and footwear industry and creating a Community programme for the sector."
"What are the key elements of this programme?"
"Commissioner, fair economic relations must be established as a matter of urgency."
"These must be at the service of the people and their countries, rather than certain economic groups or those who finance the European Union."
"Defending every country's right to produce in a sustainable way has been necessary for the future, in the name of a new economic, social, energy-oriented and environmental rationality that the neoliberal model not only fails to deliver but even renders impossible."
"Mr President, I do not see this in the same way as the previous speaker."
"I actually welcome the free trade agreement with South Korea."
"As far as I can see, it is clearly in the EU's interest to foster as close a relationship as possible between Europe and the democratic countries of Asia, including South Korea."
"For a long time, there was an imbalance in trade between Europe and South Korea because of protectionism, between the EU with its free trade and South Korea with its protectionism."
"A few decades ago, South Korea was an agricultural society; it has developed rapidly into an industrial society, with 81% of the population now living in urban areas."
"The country is now the world's eleventh largest economy and the EU's fourth largest trading partner."
"South Korea is an important ally in a strategically important area."
"Forecasts suggest that the country will have an even more dominant position in the high-tech sector in a decade's time."
"South Korea has to compete with the economic and military giant to the north of it, China, which is, at the same time, the country's main trading partner."
"In competitive terms, China has an almost inexhaustible resource in the form of cheap labour."
"Consequently, China is also the country's main trade competitor."
"By imposing quality requirements on South Korea, the EU can make the country's goods better suited for export to the US and Europe - much better than those from China, and I imagine we are all interested in bringing that about."
"This free trade agreement will, as has been mentioned, remove tariffs worth EUR 1.6 billion a year."
"That may be a very good thing in general, but for me, the question is whether South Korean trade and industry has been sufficiently liberalised and whether the roadmap for the free trade agreement can be met, taking into consideration the fact that South Korea still gives extraordinary subsidies to certain industries such as the pharmaceutical and electronics sectors."
"Mr President, during the last few months, the EU has experienced several changes and transitions."
"We have had three Commissioners on International Trade, two EU Council Presidents and the Lisbon Treaty."
"During that time, I argued with all the top officials about the need to fine-tune the South Korea-EU FTA, so as to get on board deeply dissatisfied industries, particularly the EU automotive industry."
"The strongest arguments were mainly in the area of DDB safeguards and non-tariff barriers."
"When the new Commissioner, in response to my question during the hearings, stated that DDB deserved a closer look, I felt optimistic."
"Even the USA has shelved its FTA with South Korea partly because of similar objections from the car industry."
"This is the first major FTA."
"This is a template."
"We need to do it right."
"There must be a level playing field for both parties."
"Please do not get me wrong."
"I am a strong proponent of FTAs."
"I understand their positive impact on GDP and employment, but we should also understand that, when the competitive advantage is one-sided, benefits will diminish and, in the worst case, could even be negative."
"Employees in the EU deserve better."
"Perhaps we should turn to our transatlantic partner and together demand small adjustments which would at least partially satisfy these giant industries and get new FTAs to work as soon as possible."
"There will always be some unsatisfied elements but, all in all, FTAs must be beneficial to citizens of both sides."
"It is my responsibility to monitor the situation and ensure that my constituents, and EU citizens, get a fair deal."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in September, we were already debating in plenary the free trade agreement between the European Union and Korea."
"There were already many of us who expressed our fears about the negative consequences of this agreement, especially with regard to the automobile sector."
"We did not think that events would prove us right so quickly."
"On 21 January, Opel announced the closure of its Anvers site, the production activities of which will be relocated to South Korea."
"Are we to believe that this decision has nothing to do with the free trade agreement that has just been negotiated?"
"Allow me to spot a connection there."
"During this period of economic crisis in which the workers are the first to pay for the mistakes of the financiers, the Commission is duty-bound to consider, now more than ever, the job-related consequences of the agreements that it negotiates."
"It is no longer possible to give a simplistic response to these employees, for whom we know full well it will be very difficult to find another job."
"We cannot say to them that international trade is a game of winners and losers and that, unfortunately, they are the ones who will be sacrificed and that we can do nothing about it."
"We expect answers from you today, Commissioner."
"First of all, we want to know whether your Directorate-General has assessed the impact of this agreement on jobs in Europe, for I must tell you that the figure greedily announced, that is, the EUR 19 billion profit that European exporters are expected to make, does not convince us."
"Where does this figure come from?"
"On what study is it based?"
"Leaving aside the expected positive effects, however, have the negative effects also been taken into account?"
"The Commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement."
"These methods relate, in particular, to duty drawback, an advantage that has never before been conceded, not even to our developing trade partners."
"The proposals put forward provide for complicated procedures for invoking and enforcing the safeguard clauses."
"Nevertheless I feel reassured because, for the first time ever, Parliament will soon be able to express an opinion on this text under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"I would, however, like to point out that Europe's employment problem will not be solved by palliative measures taken on a case-by-case basis."
"That is why I, together with my whole group, am calling for a real European industrial policy, one that represents a genuine strategy for the future of our industries, to be drawn up at last."
"In a context of economic crisis and of intensified global competition, this industrial policy must be coordinated effectively with the common trade policy so that our free trade agreements do not lead to job cuts in Europe."
"A second matter on which we expect clarification is that of the protocol on cultural cooperation included in the agreement."
"Several Member States have reacted very harshly to the negotiations initiated with Korea, a country that has failed to ratify the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions."
"I condemn the very principle of initiating negotiations on this topic, and I believe that cultural issues should be handled separately from trade negotiations and placed in the hands of the Commissioner for Culture so as to prevent this matter from becoming a negotiating item under the same heading as conventional goods or services."
"To conclude, Commissioner, you know how essential it is for MEPs to be kept fully informed of the negotiations under way and to be involved at all stages, including from the point at which the negotiating mandate is defined."
"Leaving aside our differences in approach, I would like to point out that better upstream consultation of Parliament would have made it easier for us to understand the strategy being pursued."
"I therefore trust I can count on your support and on that of your Commission to assist us in our future work, with everyone acting within the scope of his responsibilities, but always for the benefit of a trade policy that is obviously more European in scope, but that is, above all, fairer."
"Thank you, Mr Arif, but the interpreters are still having problems keeping up with you."
"They keep signalling to me to tell me that they cannot keep up with you."
"It is all very well to make a long speech, much longer than the speaking time permits, but the fact is it is not being interpreted."
"Therefore, only you yourself and the French speakers in the House are following what you are saying."
"Mr President, the proposal of a free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea has been considered unfair and unbalanced by the Catalan and the European car industry."
"This industry and also the European textile sector have expressed concerns on specific issues such as the duty drawback system and the safeguard clause."
"Also, the European Trade Unions Federation has criticised this free trade agreement."
"South Korea has not ratified any of the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation."
"South Korea persists in repressing trade union rights."
"Moreover, we are aware that, for this free trade agreement with South Korea, there was a clear division among the European Commission college and also among the European Commission services, in particular, between DG Taxation and Customs Union and DG Trade, on the duty drawback system."
"As far as the DG Taxation and Customs Union is concerned, the duty drawback system creates economic distortion as it is actually an export subsidy."
"This should create a clear competitive advantage against European industry in favour of Korean industry in the European Union."
"The same Korean trade investment promotion agency has calculated this advantage as at least EUR 1 300 per car."
"Therefore, does the new Commission consider this free trade agreement a fair trade agreement?"
"Will the new Commission provide Parliament with a full, up-to-date impact assessment and analyses about this duty drawback system?"
"(PL) Mr President, we are discussing, today, a very important agreement, which is going to be a model for agreements with other countries in the Far East, so careful reflection and analysis are needed."
"We must not be pressurised into acting too quickly."
"I support free competition, and think its influence on stabilisation of the political situation and on economic development is unquestionable, but it must be competition which is balanced, and which is based on competition between technologies or product production costs, and not on instruments such as duty drawback, which is included in the agreement and serves the interests, quite frankly, of only one party."
"We have an economic crisis, and we must, today, be particularly sensitive to the situation in Europe - we must take particular responsibility for the future of European industry."
"This is not only a question of the motor industry, but is also about the electronics and textiles industries."
"Numerous branches of industry, including many from Poland, are complaining about this agreement."
"Therefore, it is my conviction that we should act as follows."
"Firstly, we must be sure of the effects of the agreement, and for this we should also work with those industries which have reported misgivings about the agreement, and not only with those which think they will win on this agreement."
"I expect the Commission to produce a very comprehensive analysis of the consequences of bringing this agreement into force."
"Secondly, we must look very carefully at the safeguarding measures and at how to construct them so that the agreement will, in fact, be advantageous to both sides, and not just to South Korea."
"Thirdly, we cannot introduce this agreement provisionally before Parliament is sure that it is, in fact, advantageous to all countries of the European Union and does not establish any kind of unjustified advantage for Korean industry."
"author. - (PT) Mr President, I would like to put two questions on the importance of this agreement for the commercial policies of the EU to the Commissioner in charge of trade."
"In fact, since the launch of the Global Europe strategy in 2006, aimed at strengthening the role of international trade in the European Union's economic strategy, this is the first and only free trade agreement that has been negotiated, but not yet ratified, in which the trade partnership has been significant."
"How does the Commission view its own role and the meagre results achieved in the light of the objectives of the Global Europe strategy?"
"Does the Commission consider, then, that the credibility of its own trade policy is at stake in this treaty, and that this credibility also depends on its ratification and approval by Parliament?"
"Secondly, this treaty involves only one country, so it is a bilateral agreement."
"We know that the ambitious multilateral trade agreement under the World Trade Organisation is merely marking time, with no immediate prospects."
"The various regional agreements proposed by the European Union have failed almost everywhere, or clearly have no real prospects."
"To sum up, does this mean that this bilateral agreement is testament to the failure of EU investment in bilateral and regional agreements, and that we will henceforth be condemned to bilateralism?"
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is very clear as far as the European Union's trade policy is concerned."
"We are firm defenders of free trade and it is certainly vital that Europe continues negotiating trade agreements with other countries because they generate new opportunities for European companies, that is to say, new jobs, which are very much required in light of the serious current economic crisis."
"I did very much like your words Commissioner, because I also believe that it is very important that these agreements contain sufficient guarantees to avoid signing clauses which are unbalanced and unfair for European industry."
"The agreement with South Korea has been put forward by the Commission as the first in a new generation of more ambitious trade agreements for Europe, hence the importance of this agreement."
"It is not a question of whether it is a small country or not; it is a question of not weakening our capacity for negotiation in future agreements with much larger countries."
"Therefore, we are not against the South Korea free trade agreement; however, we do want certain paragraphs to be studied more rigorously, which we believe create unfair competitive disadvantages for certain European industrial sectors and give Korean producers an unfair advantage."
"Commissioner, I want you to clearly explain to me why the safeguard clause for the duty drawback enters into force in five years."
"On the last opportunity I had to speak to you, you stated that the reason was that tariffs on vehicles were also dismantled after five years."
"The agreement stipulates that they will dismantle the tariffs for vehicles which weigh more than five tonnes after five years."
"However, for vehicles which weigh less than five tonnes, which are all standard vehicles, the 10% tariff will be dismantled in three years."
"What is the reason for this two-year time lapse Commissioner?"
"I would also like to receive more details regarding any updates on this aspect you mentioned."
"What is the point of correcting these problems ex post when the whole reason for having a safeguard clause is to anticipate possible negative consequences?"
"(DE) Mr President, the EU should only conclude free trade agreements with countries which show full respect for human rights."
"It seems fundamental to me that the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation should be implemented and, above all, complied with."
"The labour clauses in the contract are good, but they do not go far enough."
"There have been cases in Korea, in particular in recent months, in which there have been fundamental breaches of trade union rights, such as the right to collective bargaining and the right to freedom of organisation."
"Throughout the negotiating process, the European trade unions and, in particular, the unions in the metal industry, have highlighted these cases, specifically with regard to the problems to be expected in the automotive sector."
"The case of Opel in Antwerp has been mentioned several times."
"To reiterate, operations have not only been moved because of overcapacity, as the management has repeatedly claimed, but primarily in order to relocate production to South Korea."
"Who will benefit from this?"
"Is it possible that this is an advance effect of the free trade agreement?"
"Another sector with problems which has not received as much attention is the shipbuilding industry."
"In its ten-year plan which forms part of an act of state, Korea has made it an objective to ensure that more than 90% of the companies supplying the Korean shipbuilding industry are based in Korea."
"This makes the situation for European competitors and, in particular, for the employees in the industry, very difficult."
"(Question on the basis of Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Regner, thank you very much for this opportunity."
"You have referred to the situation with Opel in Antwerp."
"I would like to ask you whether you agree with me that Opel has been in serious financial difficulty for several months, that the company could produce far more cars than it is currently doing and that Opel's poor economic situation cannot be caused by a free trade agreement that has not yet come into force."
"(DE) Mr President, of course, it is true that there are serious economic problems."
"That is very much the case."
"However, the company management and, in particular, Mr Reilly, have breached a delta agreement."
"Under the terms of this agreement, the Opel site in Antwerp was given the assurance that SUVs would be produced there."
"These cars are now not being manufactured in Antwerp, but in South Korea."
"As far as I see it, this is, in very simple terms, a case of moving existing operations from Opel in Antwerp to South Korea."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr De Gucht, I have three questions for you."
"My first question concerns the need for fair competition conditions."
"The fact that employees' rights in South Korea are restricted means that there are unfair competitive conditions, which include the question of collective action."
"Paragraph 314 of the South Korean Criminal Code refers to the crime of 'disrupting operations'."
"This is used to prevent strikes and to limit the rights of trade unions, for example, in the case of Ssangyong."
"I would also like to know why we are concluding free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea and Colombia which have the most problems with the standards of the International Labour Organisation."
"Therefore, my first question is this: How do you propose to use the free trade agreement to ensure that there are no unfair competition conditions in South Korea caused by restrictions on employees' rights?"
"My second question relates to the problems in the car industry, which several other speakers have also referred to."
"It is very important in this case that there are sensible safeguard clauses."
"General safeguard clauses are currently in place for major market disruptions and for the duty drawback system."
"I am not able to understand this fully."
"Mr De Gucht, perhaps you could explain the safeguard clauses to me in simple terms."
"I would particularly like to know who can trigger them and when."
"My third question concerns the new contractual basis for our cooperation introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This includes approving safeguard clauses and implementation as part of the codecision process."
"Can you guarantee that the free trade agreement will not be put into force until Parliament has approved this procedure and only after Parliament has exercised its rights and adopted the safeguard clauses?"
"(NL) Commissioner, I am sure you agree with me that free trade agreements are not concluded for ideological reasons, but because we are well aware of the impact that they have on society, both socially and economically."
"You, yourself, referred to a number of impact studies, but I have never read an impact study that sets out what the impact is, sector by sector, on employment."
"Many people have already spoken about the automotive sector."
"Well, we, both I and my home region, but also still your region too, to an extent, Commissioner, have discovered, in the meantime, what that impact is."
"The Opel car plant in Antwerp is closing down, and the trade unions there - and these are people who have been working on this for years and years - are absolutely convinced that this trade agreement is a very important part of Opel's much talked-about business plan, a plan which we simply do not get to see and which lies at the heart of the decision not to build the SUV in Antwerp."
"I have two questions for you about this."
"Do you know what the impact of this agreement is on employment, the effect on employment for each economic sector?"
"If not, are you prepared - and I want to press you on this - to have an impact study carried out at this point, in order to ensure that we, in Parliament, have the information that we need when we ultimately have to give our consent?"
"My second question is, do you intend, in future - with this being the start of your term of office - to consistently carry out this kind of impact study at the social level?"
"(GA) Mr President, I welcome this trade settlement between the European Union and South Korea."
"In welcoming this, I would say that, in all agreements of this nature, there are going to be winners and losers."
"Unfortunately, in this instance, the Automobile Association seems to be pointed out as the loser, but I would say that, with automobile demand likely to grow over the next 20 or 30 years fourfold at least, there may be an opportunity there."
"But the overall question pointed out by the Commissioner of the EUR 19.1 billion advantage to the European Union and EUR 12.5 billion to South Korea is a good deal in my book."
"If it was the other way round, we might have cause for concern."
"Also, we cannot underestimate the political importance of South Korea psychologically in extending the hand across the oceans to Asia - something which is very important to them - and also, where we are concerned, in re-establishing our place in the world, which was somewhat undermined in Copenhagen."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, this agreement with Korea will be the first to truly implement the Global Europe strategy as an important agreement, and it ought therefore to be particularly exemplary because it will set a precedent."
"However, we note that, firstly, there is a problem concerning the information given to Parliament, particularly with regard to the safeguard clauses, then a problem concerning the method used, since we have already been told that it might be possible to implement temporary provisions or temporarily to implement the agreement without even waiting for Parliament's assent, and finally, a problem concerning the clarity and transparency of the trade framework - this was raised by Mr Rinaldi - since, through the duty drawback, we could in fact have an agreement indirectly concluded with China."
"I believe we must be particularly clear about these free trade agreements."
"In addition, there is a consistency problem with regard to the aim of developing social and environmental standards."
"When it comes to compliance with social standards, we are, for example, a very long way from what the United States has negotiated in its agreement with Korea."
"Finally, to be honest, when one looks at the economic situation we are in, with a car industry ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put a supplementary question to the Commissioner."
"We understand that we do not have a clear framework as far as the procedure for any ratification by national parliaments is concerned, but what majority will have to vote in this agreement in the Council?"
"Is it a qualified majority or a majority by consensus?"
"This is something else I have not grasped and I believe it is important to understand this aspect of the legal basis."
"I would also add that I have been surprised by the tone of this debate."
"I feel that I have heard many concerned voices and I therefore again call on the Commission for us to work together."
"Commissioner, we are sure you will do an excellent job but, in the words of another Korean proverb, 'ask the way even when you already know it'."
"(PL) Mr President, the free trade agreement with South Korea seems a very good development."
"An agreement on a free trade area will lead to a significant growth in reciprocal trade."
"Thanks to the elimination of Korean import duties of around EUR 1.6 billion and EU import duties of around EUR 1.1 billion, there will be a significant liberalisation of trade in important sectors of industry and in services."
"This concerns mainly telecommunications, environment protection, transport, finance and legal services."
"In addition, the free trade agreement will contribute to an increase in transparency on the question of intellectual property protection and public procurement."
"Thanks to the agreement, Korea will also honour EU certificates and quality standards."
"The agreement is particularly important in the present economic situation, because it will allow for faster development in EU countries."
"We realise, however (...)."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, with respect to the procedure - because a lot of questions have been asked about that - obviously, this will be the first time that Parliament has had to give its consent on the agreement as such and also the first time that the safeguard clauses will have to be adopted by codecision."
"This has consequences, I think, for the relationship between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"The safeguard clauses are a proposal."
"The Commission adopted its proposal yesterday and it will be presented to the Council and Parliament very soon."
"Obviously, then, it will be a codecision procedure, so I do not understand the many remarks in which you put questions and express doubts about safeguard clauses."
"There will only be safeguard clauses that get your agreement, because it is codecision: it is as simple as that."
"So you should not be so worried about it and about ratification by Parliament."
"That implies, of course, that there will be a debate in your committee."
"I already said during the hearing that I am not going to make a proposal for an early, provisional application unless Parliament has itself pronounced on the agreement, whether as formal ratification by Parliament or by some other procedure that we can establish between the INTA Committee and the Commission."
"That remains open and can be discussed, but in any case, Parliament will have the opportunity to give its political judgment on the agreement before any proposals for early application are put forward."
"Another question is whether this is a mixed agreement or an agreement which is only about Community competences."
"The Legal Service is still preparing an opinion on that, but we cannot rule out the possibility that in the end, we will have to consider this a mixed agreement, which implies that all the national parliaments will also have to ratify it, and which could also have - in reply to NiccolÃ² Rinaldi's question - consequences for the voting procedure in Council."
"So much for the procedure: you will have every opportunity to express yourselves, and we will scrupulously respect this - if we did not do so, I think we would get into trouble!"
"Member of the Commission. - (NL) I will now deal with the issue of Opel."
"I understand that it is not just in Belgium, but also in other Member States, that the Opel issue arises."
"What I do not understand, however, is when people say 'look, there is a direct link between the free trade agreement with South Korea and the fact that there are plans to make closures at Opel in Europe'."
"Opel announced back at the beginning of 2009 that it intended to cut capacity in Europe by 20%."
"It is true that this can be done in such a way that, ultimately, all the factories remain open, on condition, of course, that Opel also views it as possible, from a business point of view."
"It is also the case, however, that the decision to actually produce the SUVs in South Korea came, at any event, after the agreement with Magna had been reached but before the conclusion of the negotiations over a free trade agreement between the European Union and South Korea."
"The assertion made by both Mr Belet and Mrs Van Brempt thus does not fit in with the timeline."
"The agreement with South Korea was only concluded afterwards."
"It is possible, in fact, to argue the opposite case, I would have thought, in other words, that some Member States only agreed to a free trade agreement with South Korea on condition that they knew what was going to happen with Opel."
"I think, in fact, that you have to go with this opposite case if you look at the correct timeline as it developed in practice."
"Incidentally, I would like to add, for Mr Belet's benefit, that there is a small mathematical error in the comparison he quoted, where he stated that South Korea exports 15 times as many cars to Europe as Europe exports to South Korea."
"This may be related to policies that I was recently involved in in Belgium."
"The present figures are that 37 000 cars are being exported to South Korea and approximately 440 000 imported from there."
"What is more, your line of reasoning is also faulty, as you are presuming that the two markets are the same size."
"If you compare the two markets, you have to observe that the South Korean market, of course, is much smaller than the European one, and that means that you are comparing apples with oranges."
"When it comes to market penetration, we actually send the same percentage from Europe to South Korea as comes the other way: approximately 3 to 4%."
"This is what really matters."
"Something that I think is actually far more important in estimating the market situation is the fact that South Korean manufacturers have recently opened major factories in Europe, namely in the Czech Republic and in Slovakia, which will be capable of producing around half a million cars between them on an annual basis, so the reality is perhaps that, in future, Korean cars produced in Europe will largely, in effect, be the cars that reach the market here."
"What you have there is a clear shift, and so what you actually see across the car market as a whole is that there is a displacement taking place towards the major markets where, in the end, cars can be bought and sold."
"As a final thought about what is, in any event, a particularly regrettable situation at Opel - for which, in my view, a solution is ultimately on the way - I think that one must not overlook the fact that the manufacturers follow the customers, and not the other way around, and that that is one of the most important reasons for specific policy decisions in a shrinking European car market also faced with a number of car makers who have found themselves in a difficult financial situation."
"I will, perhaps, make one last comment about the tension between bilateral and multilateral negotiations, an issue also raised by Mr Moreira."
"Negotiations based on the Doha Round have been taking place since 2001, which is now nine years, and there is still no solution to the impasse."
"I am a great supporter of multilateralism, and I think that we do also need to bring a positive conclusion to Doha, specifically retaining the development elements that it contains."
"I believe this also because its multilateral framework also provides the greatest legal certainty for international trade."
"I do think, however, that while we await the conclusion of the Doha Round - which I hope will be in 2010 or at the latest in early 2011 - we cannot sit on our hands in relation to the bilateral front."
"What I think is very important is that, when it comes to bilateral arrangements, we only conclude agreements that go further than Doha, so as not to undermine what is decided in the Doha Round, insofar as we are setting higher criteria."
"That, too, explains the drawing up of the free trade agreement with South Korea."
"It is not, in my opinion, of such a nature that it undermines multilateralism."
"If we were to undercut the multilateral track, then that would indeed be the effect, but that is not the intention, nor will it be in the forthcoming negotiations."
"The debate is closed."
"The next session will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 11 February 2010, from 09.00 to 13.00 and from 15.00 to 17.00."
"The agenda is published in the session document which contains the same name and also on the European Parliament's website."

"Framework Agreement on prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the motion for a resolution by Elizabeth Lynne and Pervenche BerÃ¨s, on behalf of the EMPL committee, on the proposal for a Council directive implementing the framework agreement on prevention from sharp injuries in the hospital and healthcare sector concluded by HOSPEEM and EPSU."
"author. - Mr President, there are over one million preventable needle-stick injuries on healthcare workers each year across the whole of the EU."
"Many of those who are injured, and their families, face an agonising wait to find out whether they have contracted a blood-borne infection such as HIV or hepatitis C."
"The risks of infection following an accident are not insignificant."
"Experts tell us the chances of infection are one in three for hepatitis B, 1 in 30 for hepatitis C and 1 in 300 for HIV."
"Take the case of Juliet Young."
"Juliet was a nurse who died in 2008, seven years after contracting HIV while taking blood from an infected patient in a London hospital."
"Juliet accidentally pricked her thumb on the needle after it slipped when she was taking a sample."
"Or the case of a dental nurse working in a prison who was pricked by a needle that was used on an inmate who had hepatitis A, B, and C and was HIV positive."
"Imagine the agonising wait that she had; she has now discovered that she has contracted hepatitis C. This nurse, and many others like her, are continuing to campaign on this issue."
"I first became involved in 2004 when I visited a hospital in my constituency at the instigation of Health First Europe, and then on World Aids Day on 1 December that year I hosted an exhibition with Stephen Hughes in this Parliament."
"Healthcare workers from across the European Union visited us, visited the Parliament, desperate for our help."
"Those of you who had the opportunity to meet with those nurses and other healthcare workers could not have failed to have been moved by their plight, and in 2006 we passed a Parliament resolution on protecting European healthcare workers from blood-borne infections due to needle-stick injuries."
"This resolution called on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to amend Directive 2000/54/EC on biological agents within three months."
"This proposal never came, but Stephen Hughes and I did not give up the fight."
"I personally have amended many reports and resolutions calling for action, spoken in plenary on this issue a dozen times and tabled countless parliamentary questions."
"Following meetings with Commissioner Å pidla, we were told in 2008 that a proposal was being prepared by the Commission and we were on the brink of achieving this."
"However, at the last minute, this was blocked as the social partners promised they would try, at long last, to reach an agreement, much to our frustration."
"A comprehensive agreement on the necessary requirements was eventually reached by the social partners in the summer of 2009."
"My resolution supports the agreement wholeheartedly."
"The Council must adopt the proposed directive urgently so that the Commission can ensure that it is implemented effectively and without delay."
"Healthcare workers across Europe are depending on us."
"Our healthcare workers cannot wait and should not continue to be placed in danger."
"It is really time now to act decisively."
"author. - Mr President, this is an important piece of health and safety legislation."
"Liz has outlined some of the background to it."
"It has been a long time in the making - six years from the first meetings we had, as she has mentioned."
"It is good to see Commissioner Andor here this morning, but it is a pity, in a way, that Commissioner Å pidla is not here."
"We have often criticised him here in this Chamber, but we could have congratulated him this morning for eventually taking the initiative to bring forward this proposal on needle-stick injuries, sharps injuries."
"We took a while to persuade him to act."
"His services, in fact, were the people who kept advising that he should not act, that the directive agreed in 2000 on the protection of workers from the risks arising from exposure to biological agents, combined with the risk assessment elements of the 1989 framework directive, were enough to prevent these sorts of injuries, but eventually we persuaded those services that, with one million injuries per year, clearly something was wrong."
"We needed specific legislation to address this problem, as they have in the United States and in parts of Spain, and it works there very effectively."
"Eventually the Commissioner agreed to act and in 2008, as Liz has said, did draft an amendment to the 2000 directive, but then HOSPEEM and EPSU, the public service unions, signalled their desire to formulate an agreement."
"They formulated that agreement."
"I am glad that they have."
"It is a good agreement, but it is a little ambiguous in certain parts."
"This is why I have tabled an amendment which has been agreed in the Employment Committee, to seek the publication by the Commission of guidance to accompany the directive to ensure the smooth and uniform transposition of this directive into law in all Member States."
"We fully support the Commission's proposal for a directive, and we understand that the agreement from the social partners cannot be touched."
"We cannot amend it."
"Council cannot amend it."
"It is their agreement."
"However, the most important part of the agreement, clause 6, which covers elimination, prevention and protection, unfortunately includes some ambiguity regarding risk assessment and precisely which preventative elements need to be implemented by employers and when."
"If this ambiguity is not clarified, then we risk seeing dramatic variability in the application of the directive."
"It is for this reason that we are requesting that the Commission produce implementation guidelines to aid employers' understanding of the risks and necessary preventative measures to ensure a consistent application of the directive."
"Needle-stick injuries are the most common and most dangerous form of medical sharp injuries."
"Whenever a hollow-bore needle is used on a patient there is a risk of a needle-stick injury that could lead to a serious infection of a healthcare worker because the hollow-bore acts as a reservoir for the patient's blood or other body fluids."
"There is a huge body of independent evidence that has proven that the introduction of improved training, safer working practices and the use of medical devices incorporating safety-engineered protection mechanisms will prevent the majority of needle-stick injuries."
"All of these things are necessary, not just one or two - all of those things are necessary."
"Studies have also demonstrated that failure to implement any one of these three elements results in a significantly reduced impact."
"Similarly, attempts to implement safety-engineered medical devices only in certain areas or on certain patients would be neither practical nor effective."
"In those countries where there is existing effective legislation such as America, Canada and parts of Spain, it is clearly mandated that all three of these elements must be implemented to prevent needle-stick injuries."
"It is no coincidence that all are the same in this respect."
"So that is the ambiguity in clause 6 that we are seeking to overcome through the publication of guidance."
"Liz has mentioned the trauma that people affected by needle-stick injuries face."
"I have met people during the six years that we have worked on this subject who have suffered needle-stick injuries, and I would really emphasise that trauma."
"I met a doctor who gave up medical practice because of a needle-stick injury."
"I met a person who has HIV as a result of a needle-stick injury."
"I have met people who turned out not to be infected, but only after months of uncertainty as to whether they were infected or not."
"I have also met garbage collectors and prison officers who have suffered needle-stick injuries."
"They are not covered by this agreement."
"That is another area that we need to think about for the future."
"Nevertheless it is a good agreement, and I think if we have good guidance to accompany it to ensure uniform application across the European Union, we will all have done a good job and hopefully we will radically reduce that figure of one million needle-stick injuries per year."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank Parliament for its work on this issue."
"In particular I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her excellent work in drawing up the motion for a resolution on the Commission's proposal and for her efforts over a number of years to improve health and safety at work for workers in the hospital and healthcare sector."
"I am aware that this is a long-standing concern of this House."
"Parliament's resolution of 24 February 2005 on promoting health and safety in the workplace called for a revision of Directive 2000/54/EC on biological agents at work."
"Again, in July 2006, Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive amending that directive."
"In response to the European Parliament, the Commission initiated a two-stage consultation of the European social partners, in accordance with the Treaty provisions."
"In response to this consultation two European social partner organisations acting in the hospital and healthcare sector, the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers' Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions, negotiated with success a framework agreement in July 2009."
"As you know, the Commission proposal aims to implement this agreement."
"We all know that injuries caused by needles and other sharp instruments are one of the most common and serious risks to healthcare workers in Europe, in particular in certain departments and activities, such as emergencies, intensive care and surgical operations."
"I am more than happy that your resolution recognises that the Commission's proposal incorporates the major points in Parliament's resolution of 6 July 2006."
"It was indeed the Commission's wish to have these points in the agreement."
"I also agree with you that the entry into force of this agreement will represent an important contribution to the protection of workers active in the hospital and healthcare sector."
"With this agreement, and hopefully the forthcoming adoption by the Council of the proposed directive, workers in the hospital and healthcare sector will benefit from an integrated approach, establishing policies in risk assessment, risk prevention, training, information, awareness-raising and so on. Such measures, which are also minimum requirements, are not only much welcomed but above all absolutely necessary."
"Let me just conclude by thanking you once again for supporting the Commission's proposal, which I hope the Council will adopt very shortly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been said, needle-stick and other sharp injuries are among the most common risks faced by healthcare workers in Europe, and they therefore represent a serious problem both for the healthcare sector and for society in general."
"The aim of this Commission proposal is to allow the Council to implement the framework agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers' Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions."
"The main aim of the agreement is to ensure greater protection for workers against the risk of injuries caused by all sharp or pointed objects used in medicine."
"This agreement therefore represents an important step towards an increase in safety within the hospital sector."
"As we all agree, the consequences of sharp injuries can be extremely serious and can cause the spread of diseases such as viral hepatitis and AIDS."
"That being said, I must stress the need for an integrated and, at the same time, realistic approach to this problem."
"In this respect I believe that the administrative, financial and legal constraints deriving from the agreement should not be excessive and therefore should not be such as to harm the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises operating in the healthcare sector, or else these enterprises could have serious difficulties in complying with the terms of the agreement."
"Just as commendable, moreover, is the anticipated - to 'anticipated' I would add 'desirable' - option for the Member States to adopt more effective provisions and measures than those contained in the agreement with the aim of protecting workers."
"Lastly, I call on the Commission to oversee the application of this agreement and to regularly update Parliament, which often focuses on this issue, so as to ensure that the agreement is monitored properly and that the need for any future amendments is examined in depth."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by also congratulating my colleague Mrs Lynne for the excellent work she has done in our committee, for her ability to reconcile all points of view and for the work that she has carried out over such a long time."
"I congratulate Commissioner Andor."
"It is your second day Commissioner and you have made a good start to your job faced with your responsibilities."
"Furthermore, there is now also a second directive relating to microfinancing which has been of concern to this House for some time."
"You will also have the honour of resolving two problems in two days' time which will open up great possibilities for many Europeans."
"I also thank Commissioner Å pidla for the help he has provided on this matter."
"You have already been made aware, and I am not going to waste too much time in reminding you, that the framework agreement is a very important legal instrument for health workers."
"They are affected by more than one million accidents each year, which also implicate serious health risks, such as viral infections, hepatitis C, AIDS and so forth. However, this is not only of significance to health workers but also to hospital patients and their families."
"Essentially, millions of Europeans will be better protected by this instrument."
"Thus, we have achieved this following a long journey which this House embarked upon by knocking on the doors of the Commission and the Council, and we must remember the excellent work done by Mr Hughes throughout this long process."
"Perhaps I can briefly explain why the socialist MEPs are very pleased today."
"I feel that today is a day to mention a few things."
"Firstly, the importance of health and safety in the workplace."
"It is crucial to create a work environment which is as safe as possible for workers, for families and for citizens."
"In human terms, we have already referred to all the implications of these types of injuries for workers and for citizens, but there are also implications in economic terms."
"A few days ago in this House, the Bilbao Agency spoke to us about some of the campaigns it is carrying out to promote health and safety and it even revealed economic studies which demonstrate that in Australia, for example, accidents and illnesses account for more than 6% of GDP in the national economy."
"What is the price paid for a lack of social security?"
"What is the price paid for a lack of hygiene and safety in the workplace?"
"It is therefore an investment in human capital, but also an investment in civilisation and economic terms."
"Secondly, the importance of prevention, as prevention is better than cure."
"Action must be taken before incidents occur so as to prevent them."
"Prevention, which is a complex issue, requires increasing awareness, information, training and supervision in relation to each of these tasks."
"Thirdly, it is vital to also mention at this stage the importance of social partners, the importance of trade unions."
"Without them this framework agreement would certainly not exist and neither would there be any kind of prevention."
"Sometimes people criticise trade unions and say that they are a cost to society but they forget the huge benefits which they provide, as they are the ones behind the introduction of such important policies in the workplace such as those within the framework agreement."
"Finally, I must mention the importance of this House, which must defend its position before public opinion and before other Community institutions, because without Parliament this framework agreement would not exist, and the importance of Parliament's cooperation with the Commission and the Council has also been exemplary."
"I appreciate the Spanish Presidency's support and I hope that this will serve as a good precedent for a new phase of cooperation between our institutions."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I was not going to take my speaking time on behalf of the group but I thought I could actually split it and come in afterwards but apparently, on a resolution, that is not the case; so I was informed this morning that I was coming in now."
"It does give me the opportunity to thank all the shadow rapporteurs whom I did not thank before; also to again thank Stephen Hughes, because it was Stephen and I in 2004 that actually went round the hospitals with John Bowis, who was a Conservative MEP."
"The three of us from the political parties went out to the hospitals to find out for ourselves, and I think that was what was so important."
"In this place we have to be driven by what is actually needed by the people on the ground and by listening to nurses and doctors and healthcare workers, it was important to take their views into account."
"Stephen mentioned implementing guidelines, and I would like to find out really whether you do know whether the Commission is thinking of bringing forward any implementing guidelines for this;"
"I think it is very important that we have these."
"Also, I was wondering whether you knew of the timetable that the Council was thinking of because it is absolutely important that we get the timetable through very quickly because after all those healthcare workers have waited so many years."
"We do not want any more needle-stick injuries unnecessarily during that waiting time."
"We have had too many over the last few years."
"Also the point which has already been made that although this is for the health sector only at the present moment I would like to see it extended to other sectors like the prisons in particular."
"I think it is very important that prison officers are protected as well."
"There are so many things that are important for those particular workers but one of the key things for this is recapable needles."
"I think along with all the other issues in the resolution it is very important that those healthcare workers are not subjected to unnecessary needle-stick injuries."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I too would like to thank Stephen Hughes and Liz Lynne for their work on this and indeed to welcome this action, although we would like to have seen it earlier."
"As has been pointed out, the USA has had legislation in place since 2001."
"We can now see such legislation in certain parts of the European Union, and at last we are catching up, but, of course, not before many people will already have been affected by this problem."
"In terms of the risk, the World Health Organisation estimates that, while 90% of exposures to this risk are in the developing world, 90% of reports about occupational infection occur in the United States and the European Union."
"We know that there is a major issue of under-reporting sharps injuries: estimates range between 40% and 75% and that is huge."
"Therefore I think we should welcome the fact that, in the social partners' agreement, clause 11 talks about the duty to report under a no-blame culture."
"But I think we also need to ask why people are not reporting."
"Presumably part of it is that they do not understand the risks or that they fear the consequences - not least, perhaps, to their future employment - of reporting such an injury."
"Indeed in some places we have reports of ineffectual follow-up, in other words, even where people do report, nothing very much happens."
"Certainly they are not getting even the medical support that they need, let alone the emotional support - or indeed, in some cases, alternative employment, if it is considered that, when they have contracted something like HIV, there may be a risk to patients."
"We have research which shows that health workers working outside hospitals are more likely to be dissatisfied with the response of employers."
"People have spoken about the scope of this action."
"Of course it covers the healthcare sector, and we are very pleased that the agreement covers trainees and subcontractors."
"I am not entirely sure whether that includes cleaning staff, and I would welcome some clarification on that."
"But it does not yet cover workers in other professions at risk, so we hope Member States could look at that."
"The training obligations are extremely important, and I hope Member States will take this seriously: both the giving and receiving of training should be mandatory, as should induction for all new and temporary staff - because I think there is a feeling that if you train people once you never have to look at that issue again."
"At the moment there is a lack of training even where employers have training policies in place."
"An issue was raised about the cost."
"There are estimates that training and preventative measures, including safer devices, account for about a third of the cost of dealing with sharps injuries."
"That is an important saving in cash-strapped times, as well as being an important issue both for the people concerned and employers, who may indeed find themselves at risk of legal action if they are not taking action to prevent such injuries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the agreement on prevention from sharp injuries is historically the first agreement between sectoral social partners."
"In view of the fact that there are estimated to be more than one million cases a year of sharp injuries in hospitals in Europe, we do not need convincing here that this is a step in the right direction, as it should be possible to prevent these injuries through proper adherence to the agreement."
"In practice this will help to create a safe working environment and to protect health workers from blood-transmitted infections caused by sharp injuries."
"Although we can see certain ambiguities in the examples or in the definitions, I believe that all steps will be taken to obtain as much information as possible from the social partners, all of the provisions have been clarified and the Council has therefore adopted the agreement as a whole."
"I would like to emphasize at this point that the agreement between employers and employees is in its way a completely unique European legal instrument, which at national level has no parallel in most Member States."
"This form of self-regulation, where those affected by a given problem themselves agree in the form of a legal regulation on its resolution, is in my view a model example of European regulation."
"It is not the same situation as with CO2 emissions, tax harmonisation or the standardisation of public services, where companies and their employees must passively comply with whatever we and the Member States throw at them, and at great cost too."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for the magnificent piece of work they have carried out in preparing this document."
"I am also delighted as a doctor that here in the European Parliament we are aware of the urgency of the need for health workers to be better protected from injuries caused by sharp objects and that the regulation responds to this."
"I am very uneasy, of course, about the very slow progress of the Commission."
"Five years have passed now since the European Commission was first informed about this important issue and almost four years since the European Parliament adopted a resolution requiring a legislative solution to the question of proper protection for health workers in the European Union from blood-transmitted infections."
"As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the previous parliamentary term I worked together with my colleagues Stephen Hughes and Elizabeth Lynn and others on this resolution and I am disappointed that there has been such a long delay."
"I recommend that the measures proposed in the directive are adopted as quickly as possible."
"I would like to call for the greatest possible levels of protection and prevention for health workers to be guaranteed as soon as possible."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to tell you how delighted I am this morning that we have agreed this proposal for a directive on the prevention of sharps injuries."
"We have here a real health issue, which we must regulate as quickly as possible."
"We all know the importance and the dramatic consequences of this type of injury."
"I feel I must let you know, Commissioner, that I am confident you will provide a rapid solution for this agreement, which will take us several steps forward on this issue."
"I should like to thank Mrs Lynne for all her work."
"I should like equally to thank Mr Hughes, because it is our responsibility as MEPs to see to it that our fellow citizens are protected."
"They are healthcare professionals, of course - we have spoken a lot about them."
"They are cleaners - you have mentioned prison officers - but I should also like to mention people working in the school environment, in all areas of medicine in schools."
"However, well beyond this, I consider that it is a question of educating all our fellow citizens, who must not make healthcare workers or those workers that subsequently handle blunt objects take unnecessary risks."
"I must say that, along with the rapporteurs who have taken up this issue, we in the European Parliament will be ready and willing to ensure that these texts are implemented by all Member States, and we shall need to have a regular update on their implementation."
"This is truly our commitment, our responsibility, and it is something that should be really popular and shared by all."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to thank the older members of Parliament - as this is my first term of office - and my fellow members Mr Hughes and Mrs Lynne and the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, because I have come in on the tail end of work on an issue which, in a way, also concerns me personally."
"My husband is a doctor and, a few years ago, he was infected by a needle."
"So I know full well the anxiety experienced by the family of a hospital worker injured by a sharp object."
"The days spent waiting for the results were extremely difficult."
"I should therefore like, once again, to say thank you for the work which has been done and to express my satisfaction at the fact that, for the first time, we are seeing an association of employers and an association of workers joining forces and agreeing, thereby enabling us to arrive at this motion for a resolution."
"I feel that the European Union really is achieving its objectives and is now taking decisions with its citizens, for its citizens."
"I remember something which other members have repeated, but I think it is important for us to say it and to always remember it: that a million sharp injuries occur each year."
"I cannot overemphasise the role played by the European Parliament, which has been working earnestly on this issue since 2005."
"Given, on the other hand, the lack of staff, a lack which is particularly acute in Greece, I would point out that we really must ensure that this resolution, this directive is applied very quickly."
"This is a decision that will also make a practical contribution to the social objectives of the European Union, which include increasing employment."
"I would remind the House that the European Commission recently told Parliament, through its re-elected President, that one of the sectors in which it aims to invest are white-collar jobs."
"So let us save lives both literally and metaphorically, by creating valuable jobs in these very difficult economic and social times."
"To close, I should like to wish the new Commissioner every success in his job and, if I may, say the following: our honourable and experienced colleague, Mr Cercas, said earlier that he hopes that you will enter and proceed with the 'right' foot."
"I hope that you will enter and proceed with the 'left' foot and I say that because the approach which will wear the social face of Europe on the outside is very important."
"We need to focus on the workers, the European people need that."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too will share a personal experience."
"I have been working in hospitals for 15 years, and for a time I was in fact a healthcare worker in a critical area: the operating theatre."
"I myself have been pricked by potentially infectious needles and instruments."
"Therefore, as Mrs Rapti was saying, I can still remember the anxiety I felt when awaiting my test results, but above all how I went through the so-called 'window period' between the potential contamination and the hypothetical outbreak of disease."
"Precisely because of this experience, I believe that we must vote in favour of this resolution, which finally gives legal force to the agreement in safety and protection terms by establishing minimum standards for all healthcare workers."
"The healthcare sector accounts for 10% of the European Union's labour force and, to be more precise, there are an estimated 1.2 million cases of accidental sharp injuries each year, with the result that healthcare workers gradually become demotivated and very often leave the healthcare profession."
"Moreover, the World Health Organisation estimates that 2.5% of cases may seroconvert to HIV and in 40% of cases to various forms of hepatitis B and hepatitis C."
"Precisely because of the numerous serious risks that are presented all too often on a daily basis, the healthcare profession is considered unattractive, so much so that it has suffered from a shortage of staff in recent years."
"Moreover, as has already been mentioned here, the cost for the individual healthcare services that have to deal with the stressful situations to which healthcare workers are subjected during the various monitoring periods, and of the diagnostic tests which, as a protocol, last for at least six months from the time of the accident, is considerable, and then there are the costs associated with the professionals who have unfortunately contracted the disease."
"To conclude, in order not to underestimate the problem, when the risk of an accident can be avoided or reduced, it is necessary and right to take every preventive measure available."
"In particular, it is the employer's duty to introduce these measures, and it is the worker's duty to comply with them."
"(PL) Mr President, we are talking about a problem which has, indeed, grown to be one of the most significant in the area of healthcare."
"I will mention some statistics here."
"In the European Union, around a million of these unfortunate sharp injuries occur annually."
"In the United States, it is estimated to be a matter of around 380 000, but the Americans themselves say this figure is an underestimate."
"Of course, we must stress that this mainly concerns healthcare workers, but there is another aspect, too: we are also talking about patients who are also at risk from this."
"In these cases, and we have to be honest here, we are faced with the problem of the huge sums which hospitals are having to pay in compensation."
"It is clear, as other speakers have already said, that prevention is of absolutely fundamental significance here."
"For prevention is always significantly cheaper than treatment."
"The resolution, in my opinion, is fully deserving of support."
"It is an answer to expectations expressed by the healthcare sector, and its importance is enhanced because the problem is growing."
"The problem of compensation is also growing, and claims are being made by healthcare workers as well as patients."
"Indeed, the financial aspect is not insignificant, either."
"My political group, on whose behalf I speak, supports the motion for a resolution."
"We think this is how we can respond to what is, in fact, a certain challenge of our time, and also meet the needs of consumers and workers in the healthcare sector in the countries of the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, I take the floor today to thank all the rapporteurs and everyone who brought about this debate."
"Sometimes we say that Europe needs to get closer to its citizens."
"With this debate, we have certainly managed to do so."
"I was talking to a friend of my own age, a newly-qualified doctor, and when I told him about this debate, he said to me, with a great deal of pleasure, that this was absolutely crucial and that we should try and explain exactly what we were doing to everybody in Europe."
"It is important to prevent and to inform those working in hospitals about the risks they run."
"It is indeed crucial that we explain to everybody that, when they work such long hours, when spaces are sometimes confined, when patient numbers are very high, it is crucial for these people to be able to take, at the very least, the most important measures needed."
"We need healthy staff in hospitals so that we, as patients - at some point - can benefit from their care and the best possible treatment."
"(DE) Mr President, the objective of our policy should be to create an environment which guarantees the highest possible standard of living for the citizens of the European Union."
"One key challenge that we face in times like these, therefore, is maintaining and creating jobs."
"However, we should not be able to neglect our duty to ensure that these jobs do not make people ill or put their health at risk."
"That is why prevention, healthcare and job security are essential."
"I strongly believe that the implementation of this directive, which is actually long overdue, will create the right conditions for making jobs safer in every area of healthcare, where staff are confronted with these risks on a daily basis."
"I think that it is in the interests of all European citizens that we make this a reality as soon as possible."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to say I am glad that this proposal enjoys such broad support in Parliament."
"I regret that the process lasted longer than many of you expected, but I would like to say that I am absolutely convinced that social dialogue has to play a role: we have to respect the opinion of the social partners."
"This not only enhances the legitimacy of a decision, it also helps with its implementation, because those who participate in the creation of a new rule are more interested in its success."
"This is very important."
"We are already aware that there is a working document between the social partners concerning clarification of the framework agreement and also its implementation, so we hope - and I think that we can trust - that this will play a significant role in finalisation in the Council: this will be an answer to some of the concerns about implementation."
"Apart from that there is also an interest in the longer term follow-up."
"This is also very important in order to monitor how successful this new directive will be."
"I would like to draw your attention to the text which says that the signatory parties shall review the application of this agreement five years after the date of the Council decision if requested by one of the parties to the agreement."
"In other words, it is very important that the monitoring of implementation and of changes in the occurrence of such injuries should be the starting point, should any of the parties wish to use this opportunity."
"Finally, let me say, on what is just the second day of the new Commission - as a few speakers highlighted in their messages - that it is indeed very important that the Commission pays more attention to the forgotten people in Europe, those age groups or professions which cannot easily speak for themselves: they have been sometimes ignored or sidelined in earlier times."
"The healthcare sector is clearly an important sector; we have to give it a lot of devotion and attention."
"It is not only that workers in the hospital and healthcare sector are exposed to sharp injuries and infections, we all know that they also work very long hours."
"So we have to take a kind of comprehensive approach when considering groups like this, which are very important, especially in times of crisis when the expected fiscal consolidation will affect the conditions these people work in."
"This is why this should be very high on our agenda, as it is on my personal agenda."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I am sure we are all grateful to the initiators of this debate."
"Let us hope that things improve."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12.00 today."
"Online gambling in relation to recent ECJ rulings (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on online gambling in relation to recent ECJ rulings, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu BuÅoi and Heide RÃ¼hle, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - B7-0235/2009)."
"author. - Mr President, first of all it is a privilege on behalf of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection to welcome our new Commissioner Michel Barnier for the first time to what I am sure will be many interchanges across the floor of this House, and particularly because he has moved seamlessly from his seat over there to his seat at the front in two days."
"Commissioner, we are very pleased to have you here."
"Secondly, on behalf of the committee, to have the chance essentially to put on record with this question our concern about the developments of online gambling, and indeed the gambling sector overall and some of the many uncertainties that are arising about the whole legislative regime for gambling within the internal market."
"I know you will have a considerable in-tray already, Commissioner, but we hope very much that this will be an item that will be close to the top of your in-tray because it is an area which my committee has been very concerned about over the last five years."
"We have done a number of own-initiative studies and questions about it and indeed the author of our last major report, Mrs Schaldemose, will be speaking later and so we have a sustained interest in this topic."
"As you all know, the Member States have also been meeting together regularly at Council level on various reflection groups about how to tackle the issue about the growth of online gambling in relation to our own countries' gambling activities."
"I think I should make it clear first of all that this question does not in any way presuppose a new liberalisation of gambling markets or indeed not necessarily any new initiative in that direction."
"But the fact remains as you all know that the intense and growing popularity of online gambling is certainly also putting pressure on many national monopolies and existing schemes that may be state owned or state controlled, which raise very large amounts of revenue but are of concern to Member States."
"What we are saying to you is that, in conjunction with this work that has been going on, there have been a number of references to the European Court of Justice; you will be aware of the details, and colleagues may talk about that later."
"I am not going to go through those, but from our perspective we see that the inconsistencies of some of the approaches to the Court of Justice are not in fact helping but if anything making the situation more complex and opaque than it was before."
"We also know that your services have issued a number of infringement cases in gambling issues, not all of them online, but many of them also relate to the whole question of freedom of operators to go and establish themselves in other countries."
"All of these things now mean that it is absolutely the right time for the Commission to be collating this information, looking at the process of infringement proceedings, examining the issues raised by the Court of Justice judgments and coming out, first of all, with a clear strategy or clarification about where we are going to move forward and starting to deal with some of those inconsistencies."
"From a consumer protection point of view, regulators also need to know where they stand about dealing with online gambling."
"Clearly, it can be regulated and it must be regulated - and, indeed, there are many good instances where online gambling providers are clearly committed to providing the tools and the controls to deal with problems of addictive gambling and so on - and, of course, there are issues about fraud and about problems there which we have also debated extensively in our committee."
"This is a consumer protection issue as well as being an internal market consistency issue."
"Finally, I think we must also respect our citizens and the fact that many of them do want to access online gambling."
"I do not think there is any intention whatsoever to try and ban that - indeed it would be practically impossible - but there are major inconsistencies there."
"In some countries, for example, it is apparently illegal to take part in an online gambling contest with a company outside your own country."
"That cannot be right."
"Another inconsistency which has been pointed out by one of my constituents is that if a British citizen accesses the British national lottery online from Spain and wins a prize, it will be illegal for the lottery to pay them in Spain."
"There are these inconsistencies that we have to tackle for the good of our citizens and the good of consumers."
"Commissioner, that is the context of this question."
"You will hear lots of good contributions and interesting views from my colleagues, but I hope that you will make this one of your top priorities in your new role."
"Member of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you can imagine the great pleasure it gives me to return here just 48 hours after the investiture of the College - for which I thank you - and to continue my work with you, Mr Harbour - and I say this in particular to the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - in a different manner, and most likely in a different place, but in the same spirit."
"I wish to make three points by way of response at this stage, before listening carefully to what you have to say."
"Let me start with your first question."
"As you say, the Commission has initiated infringement procedures against a number of Member States in the area of the cross-border provision of sports betting services."
"The Commission notes that, in four of the nine infringement cases - that is in Denmark, France, Italy and Hungary - amendments to domestic legislation have been proposed in response to the infringement procedures."
"The Commission will continue to work with all Member States concerned to resolve the problems identified in these infringement procedures."
"In general, these procedures remain open, but it is for the new Commission to decide how to proceed with these questions."
"The second point, Mr Harbour, is the recent ruling of the European Court of Justice in the Portuguese case, where a long-established state monopoly exercises strict control over gambling."
"According to the analysis carried out by the Commission's legal service, this decision will fundamentally change neither the development nor the assessment of the infringement procedures in this area."
"Every case has been evaluated according to the evidence presented by each Member State."
"Following recent Court rulings, the Commission notes that the Court always requires, in conformity, moreover, with established case law, that any possible restrictions should, firstly, be justified by valid considerations of the public interest and, secondly, should be necessary and proportionate."
"This includes the need for the restrictions to be appropriate, coherent and systematic."
"It does not therefore follow from the Santa Casa case that the Court has given Member States greater leeway to impose restrictions."
"The Court made very precise reference to the operating methods of the Portuguese monopoly, to its very long history and to the very specific circumstances of that country."
"For point three of my first speech, I should like to stress, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission has not ruled out alternatives to infringement procedures."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to start a constructive debate on this question with the European Parliament, but also with the Member States and the parties concerned."
"I note that there has been no consultation with Member States on this question since the latter chose in 2006 to withdraw gambling from the scope of the Services Directive."
"I shall therefore be listening to Member States and I have decided to follow closely the proceedings of the Council working group."
"I know that on the initiative of Mrs Schaldemose, Parliament adopted a report on 10 March, even though a number of Members supported an opposing resolution."
"As far as I am concerned, Parliament's work is a good starting point for opening a genuine debate on a potential European solution to this complex issue."
"We must undertake a closer examination of the reasons why Member States restrict online gambling services."
"In this context, we must, of course, deal with the social aspects, notably the problems of addiction associated with gaming, and I have decided to do so."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the College has scarcely been in office two days, and we have not yet adopted our work programme."
"Starting from today, I want to carry out this consultation exercise by listening very carefully to everything that each of you has to say."
"It - I refer here to consultation - is an exercise in relation to which there are, of course, several possibilities."
"In particular, one such possibility that I am prepared to consider is a green paper on this question."
"I should like to thank you again for your interest in this important subject and for the contribution you will be making to the Commission's work that I shall be undertaking."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to say how pleased I am that you, Commissioner, have just made it clear that you wish, not only to consider a targeted analysis of the case-law in the Liga Portuguesa case, but also to raise the issue of how the Council working group might respond appropriately to the increase in online gambling."
"In the context of this oral question, of course, we are concentrating only on online gambling."
"My understanding of the ruling in the Santa Casa case is that, although the European Court of Justice reminded Member States that the gambling market is totally unlike any other market, Member States were still required to agree on rules which would be uniform throughout the European Union."
"Up until now, no constructive attempt has been made to do this within the Council, although the Council was, in fact, adamant that it would address the issue itself."
"That is why the Commission and Parliament have to work together to make progress in this area and to ask critical questions."
"Secondly, I would like to add that I am not persuaded by the arguments put forward by Member States as regards ensuring consumer protection in the gambling market."
"Member States claim that, when it comes to online gambling (and this applies to the Liga Portuguesa and Santa Casa cases, as well), they are capable of implementing the objectives of consumer protection and efficiently tackling any attendant crime on their own, without any European involvement."
"If you turn this argument on its head, however, the logical conclusion would be that we are in a situation where Europe is much less capable than individual Member States of finding appropriate solutions to the more unfortunate criminal activities which happen on the Internet and other things which take place online."
"I find that to be a rather odd conclusion and do not believe it to be the case."
"My view is that we will only be able to find a solution to online gambling if we adopt uniform cross-border regulations which safeguard the interests of Member States based on their partially historical structures, but which, as the Committee Chair has pointed out, also place the interests of consumers at the centre of our efforts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for the information you have given us but, to be honest, I am not entirely satisfied."
"The previous Commission set itself the quite clear objective of liberalising the gambling market."
"The European Parliament has made it clear, time and again, that this cannot be the right approach, because it was the European Parliament, rather than Member States, that, for example, removed gambling from the scope of the Services Directive."
"We took the view that it is not just any other service, that we must ensure that we introduce safeguards which will protect our citizens from organised crime and that we require clear rules to that end."
"Nonetheless, the European Commission continues to bring Member States before the European Court of Justice, and it is time that the Commission ceased this practice as it keeps losing cases at the Court."
"You simply have to face this fact."
"I would, therefore, welcome it, Mr Barnier, if you put what you have just said, that is, that a different approach is needed in this area, into practice because we cannot proceed with things remaining as they are now."
"In response to your point, Mr Harbour, I would argue that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been very consistent and not at all contradictory."
"In its judgments, the Court has stated, time and again, that Member States have the right to introduce clear rules, so that we can truly verify whether or not citizens are protected against crime, and that Member States are not under any obligation to open this market up."
"Nor are they under any obligation to allow market operators from other Member States to operate on their territory, as long as they make sure that their controls are strong and effective."
"That is what we want to see from the European Commission, that it has finally grasped this and acted accordingly."
"However, this also means that we have to pay particular attention to online gambling, because the Internet does not recognise any barriers or borders and, of course, because our citizens have access to gambling sites."
"We need to think about how we can shape controls and rules in this area, so that our citizens are protected."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, if what you are calling for is further development and harmonisation of the internal market, then we need to have a common set of rules."
"There are three aspects to online gambling which ought to be considered in this debate."
"How can we best protect the interests of our citizens and consumers?"
"How can we best prevent fraud and criminal activity?"
"How can we best protect our citizens from harm?"
"The European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2009 on the integrity of online gambling has indicated methods and ways to proceed with regard to this issue."
"Now, as before, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe endorses the principles concerning the integrity of online gambling contained in Parliament's resolution of 10 March 2009."
"In accordance with a ruling of the European Court of Justice, each Member State is free, under certain conditions, to regulate online gambling itself and the resolution of 10 March stresses that emphatically."
"National rules are better suited to combating match-fixing fraud, although this type of fraud cannot be eliminated entirely, as demonstrated by some recent examples in Germany."
"It has to be said, though, that gambling markets are much better regulated at national level, according to the tradition and culture of the country concerned."
"Players are offered better protection against addiction, fraud, money laundering and match-fixing if they can play through major online gambling service providers, who always, by definition, operate across borders."
"We cannot regulate everything according to the internal market concept and particularly not the prevention of underage gambling or gambling addiction."
"Online gambling provides increased opportunities for corrupt practices, such as fraud, match-fixing and illegal betting cartels, as online games can be set up and dismantled very rapidly."
"Illegal offshore betting operators present a particular problem in this regard, as it is almost impossible for them to be regulated or controlled."
"Profits from gambling should primarily be used for the benefit of society in order to promote amateur sport, amongst other things."
"It is best to leave this to the competence of national administrations."
"Continuous funding, for culture and professional and amateur sport, for example, gives individual Member States some justification for permitting gambling."
"However, a precondition for that is that the risk of addiction must be highlighted and proactively combated."
"As the full impact on consumers of the specific forms of gambling services offered online is not yet known, we need to take urgent action to fill this knowledge gap."
"It is essential in this context that Member States really do fulfil their tasks."
"Market surveillance is also key, when it comes to online gambling."
"If we in the European Parliament can agree that Member States have the right, under the principle of subsidiarity, to regulate their gambling markets according to their own traditions and cultures, we also then have to ensure that this is actually happening, through efficient control and market surveillance."
"Mr President, having listened to the two previous speakers, there is not much left for me to say."
"I would just like to clearly reiterate that our group fully supports Parliament's motion for a resolution, but that we also wish to question the earlier assertion that the rulings of the European Court of Justice have been ambiguous."
"On the contrary, I think that the ECJ rulings have been very clear indeed."
"We also very much welcome your saying that you wish to initiate consultations with Member States."
"Perhaps I should add that a consultation would be better than an infringement procedure."
"Consultation is the right way to solve this problem, taking into account national particularities and for finding a solution for the consumer."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I speak as a former Minister in the UK responsible for gambling controls, so, when we talk about a Europe of free trade and a Europe that opposes protectionism, a Europe which opens markets and tears down trade barriers, of course I am very much in favour of that."
"Some of our colleagues, who stand up here and call for a more open Europe, are also the same people who are supporting the maintenance of monopoly structures for the gambling industry."
"I might say that monopolies - or they might say I should say - that monopolies are better at controlling and treating the problem of gambling which has been discussed this morning."
"That is very interesting, because a lot of the data certainly does not support that argument."
"The arguments for protectionism and monopolies in the gambling sector are self-serving; more control and then more money for national governments."
"This is not the open Europe or the transparent Europe that I want."
"It is the Europe which says, 'do as I say, not as I do'."
"There is no reason why private gambling providers operating under high levels of regulated protection in one EU Member State should not be allowed to operate in others."
"There is no reason why a tightly regulated but open market will not provide an equivalent, if not a higher, level of protection to citizens as any tightly controlled state monopoly."
"As we wait for that, the European Court of Justice's verdicts continue to roll out."
"They must be getting a bit sick of the issue in Luxembourg - or, speaking as a lawyer, perhaps they are not quite so sick of it - but above the deafening silence that has come from the Commission so far, it does seem to me that it is now time for action."
"The degree of legal uncertainty must be ended."
"Can I just say that I think it is important for Parliament to signal its renewed willingness to tackle the issue and to send a strong signal to the Council and Commission that we should not hide away from this."
"With a new Commission we do hope for new impetus."
"I have great faith in you, Commissioner Barnier."
"I hope that you will note the advice that you receive and begin to work out a strategy to ensure that online gambling can become a legitimate part of the internal market with, of course, appropriate regulations in place."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) 'Gokken is dokken' (to gamble is to cough up) is a well-known saying in the Netherlands."
"It means that gamblers usually lose."
"In addition, gambling is addictive. For young people, in particular, it constitutes a real threat."
"If anyone has a romantic notion of gambling, then I have to disappoint them."
"Essentially, it is a billion-euro business that is all too often associated with criminal activities."
"Therefore, legislation is in force in the Netherlands to combat gambling in easily accessible facilities frequented by large numbers of young people."
"However, online gambling - often cross-border in nature - has made it all the more accessible once again."
"In this specific case, therefore, rather than relying on the free market, we must not just allow Member States to take restrictive measures but actually encourage them to do so."
"In my opinion, the oral question that prompted this debate still relies rather too heavily on market forces."
"In particular, I am not convinced that it is possible to speak of 'responsible' gambling on the Internet."
"In my opinion, online gambling should be curbed as much as possible."
"The European Court of Justice has recognised that Member States must have scope for taking action, and so I appeal to the Commission not to attempt to lower the level of protection by means of European legislative proposals, but rather to encourage Member States to issue rules affording high levels of protection."
"I also call on the Commission to desist from referring Member States to the Court, as Mrs Gebhardt said, but rather to encourage dialogue on the best possible protection."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (SK) As regards the issue of online gambling, I would like to mention two areas in which I see several unresolved problems."
"We are striving to ensure that communications between people are as open as possible."
"That also implies open access to the Internet for children and young people."
"In Point 16 of its resolution of 10 March 2009, the European Parliament states that it is parents who bear the responsibility for protecting underage children from online gambling."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you, what kind of nonsense is this?"
"Who creates the legislative framework, who creates the rules for such businesses?"
"Is it parents or someone else?"
"We are the ones that are responsible for this kind of business, we create the legislative framework and we create the laws, so it is governments and parliaments that are responsible for protecting children from gambling."
"At a time when pornography and gambling come into our homes in 3D format, parents have no hope of protecting their children from these influences or of protecting them from being drawn into such activities."
"I therefore think that it is a fundamental duty of the Commission and of the European Parliament to create a legal framework and not to support those who run such businesses through their inaction."
"Rather, they should be supporting those that elected them and to whom they are accountable."
"Another problem I would like to mention is that of controlling the flow of money."
"In various countries money from gambling and that kind of activity is given to support sport, culture and education."
"If we are to lose money flows from individual countries to the Bahamas and tax havens then I would like to ask whether some of this money could be brought back to support sport in the various countries."
"Because if we operate and play games of chance via the internet then the profits are created elsewhere and not in the countries the players come from."
"This issue also remains unresolved and inadequately supervised, and in my opinion there is a real need for the European Commission to wake up and start working on framework rules for this kind of activity."
"We have to create the necessary conditions so that, on the one hand, we do not put the health and education of children at risk and, at the same time, we do not miss out on the financial resources that go into gambling."
"- (CS) The development of online gambling makes it possible to circumvent Member State laws and to launder money with almost no control at all."
"For the internal market there is a question mark over the monopoly position of the gambling companies and another question mark over the murky financing of professional sport, precisely on account of its links to gambling."
"It increases the risk of addiction, especially for young people."
"The European Court of Justice, in view of the public interest, acknowledged the right of governments to ban or to restrict online gambling."
"Although online gambling has no borders, its regulation differs in every Member State in terms of levels of taxation, accessibility, checks and the level of legal responsibility of operators."
"It is not enough, moreover, to monitor the quality of the official gambling and lottery companies - movement of money must also be monitored."
"Effective controls are no longer possible without an agreement on common rules for all 27 Member States."
"We therefore asked the Commission last year to propose a framework European regulation for online gambling."
"I firmly believe that there should also be a ban on advertisements for online gambling which target young people."
"Exposing children to the influence of advertisements for online gambling is the same as exposing them to unlimited supplies of alcohol, cigarettes, drugs or other addictive substances."
"The Czech Republic is unfortunately the furthest behind in the Union in terms of regulations."
"Not only does it not restrict advertising of this kind, but it also fails to rule out the combination of gambling houses and pawn shops in the vicinity of schools."
"I expect that this report will give the Commission fresh impetus to negotiate the measures essential for harmonising the regulation of online gambling with regard to the public interest of EU countries."
"(DA) Mr President, welcome to Parliament Mr Barnier and good luck with your job."
"I am actually very pleased to be standing here today debating online gambling with you, because during your hearing in Parliament you placed particular emphasis on your view that the internal market should be there for the citizens and not the other way round."
"Here we have a good opportunity to demonstrate this in practice."
"Let me start by saying that I support the initiatives that you mentioned."
"They were a little vague, but it sounds sensible to draw up a Green Paper, to get lots of studies going, to gather data and find out about this area in a way that provides us with an overview of how things stand at European level."
"However, I would also like to remind you of the political realities."
"Whilst it is true that there was also a minority opinion when my report was adopted in March, the clear majority in Parliament supported my report, just as there is a very great deal of support in Council for clarification - but at the same time we must ensure that it is up to the Member States to define how they wish to regulate the whole area of gambling."
"What we need in the area of online gambling is, of course, to find out how we can protect our citizens, investigate the social costs of gambling, and so on."
"I would have liked to have heard a somewhat clearer answer, however."
"You have only just taken up your post and are still new, but I would like a slightly clearer answer as to whether your line will be to drop the cases concerning treaty infringements and to enter into a much more constructive dialogue with Parliament and the Council so that we can establish how to deal with this."
"I therefore suggest you stop letting the European Court of Justice decide the cases; let us take political decisions concerning these."
"Is that the line you want to take or not?"
"That is what I would have liked to have a very clear answer on."
"(GA) Mr President, I welcome this timely debate on online gambling and in particular, on the problems relating to underage gambling and vulnerable consumers."
"It is in the interest of both the public and of consumers that leadership and clear and definite direction be shown when tackling this issue."
"I raised the issue of gambling with the Commission at the beginning of last November, and the reply I received stated that the Commission supports the Safer Internet Programme, information centres and helplines in the Member States."
"These provide information to parents about the dangers children could encounter on line - including online gambling."
"As it is, however, online gambling is a hidden problem and it is a problem that is growing."
"With online gambling as opposed to conventional gambling, there is a clear problem of a lack of physical supervision."
"There is no responsible or immediate management present to ensure that the gambler is of age and acting legally."
"The security checks and safety procedures on online gambling sites can be overcome; borrowed or stolen credit cards can be used by minors and identities can be faked."
"For vulnerable consumers gambling on the Internet is usually conducted in isolated settings and experts in this area point to the increased problem of acting on impulse and the potential for unchecked and reckless gambling and because, with under-age gamblers, the traditional safeguards of conventional gambling are not present."
"With online gambling it is more difficult to determine a problem gambler as it takes time, responsibility and resources to identify who is playing, who is paying and who has a problem."
"Clear direction is needed at all levels in order to tackle this issue so that definitive steps can be taken to tackle the problem of under-age gamblers and to ensure the interests of the most vulnerable consumers are protected."
"(NL) Mr President, there are approximately 120 000 gambling addicts in the Netherlands, which represents nearly 1% of our population."
"Gambling addiction leads to serious social problems, such as broken homes, money problems and crime."
"Therefore, Member States should make every effort to combat gambling and the associated problems with maximum force."
"Mr President, what is striking is that some Member States have a completely legal gambling market."
"In addition, the gambling industry would have us believe that the gambling market is a normal sector of the internal market and thus need not be subject to restrictions."
"This beggars belief."
"Member States should not be facilitating any markets that promote social misery."
"Unfortunately, many people cannot resist the lure of gambling."
"For this reason, the Dutch government has decided to take ownership of the gambling market and allow only a State monopoly on gambling."
"Although I would prefer not to see casinos going up anywhere in the European Union, I still consider this the least bad solution."
"Mr President, the European Parliament must issue a very strong call to those Member States in which gambling is permitted to strongly discourage that market wherever possible."
"(EL) Mr President, the question indirectly calls for new Community legislation."
"However, given that even the European Court of Justice has laid down the limits and preconditions under which the Member States, through their national legislation, can stipulate how online gambling is to be regulated, there is no need to call for European legislation."
"Furthermore, the Court ruled in the Schindler case that gambling has certain moral, religious and cultural overtones, harbours a high risk of crime or fraud and may have harmful consequences on the individual and on society."
"That is the most important point."
"It is precisely on these grounds of public interest that this sector should remain under the control of the Member States, which know more about its peculiarities and how to handle them."
"Moreover, this is endorsed both by the study prepared for the Commission by the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law and in the 2009 report by Mr Schaldemose adopted by Parliament."
"This report concludes that an approach solely within the framework of the internal market is not appropriate in this highly sensitive sector and calls on the Commission to pay particular attention to the views of the European Court of Justice on this matter."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with the European Court of Justice ruling, because the possibility for a Member State to prohibit private operators from offering online gambling services highlights the need to standardise a market that is highly profitable, but just as highly risky, for consumers."
"Therefore, in the absence of any European harmonisation of gambling activities, each country is free to choose its own level of protection."
"It is often impossible to identify where the application of such a restriction begins and ends."
"In fact, while the Commission has launched a series of infringement proceedings against some countries - which I would point out also include Italy - for having violated the principle of the free movement of services, the European Court has, on the contrary, upheld Portugal's restrictive decision."
"In this context, the European institutions have the fundamental task of guiding the gambling sector through a regulatory process that is fully harmonised among the Member States at EU level."
"It is necessary, therefore, to go beyond individual economic interests and to ensure a significant level of protection of consumers, and in particular of children, who are the main victims of crime and fraud in such cases."
"- (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in the midst of a conflict between two policies that are dear to the European Union: the protection of consumers and public order on the one hand, and the freedom of movement and provision of services on the other."
"According to the case-law of the Court of Justice on this matter, the Member States should maintain their autonomy and legitimacy in regulating the activity of providers of online gambling and gambling games."
"This is a sensitive area that impacts upon societal values regarding deviant behaviour related to gambling and also upon national traditions of directing the sums received from this market towards the financing of social works."
"Over the last few years, the case-law from Luxembourg has formulated a coherent and consistent line of judicial thinking that should lead the European institutions and the Commission, in particular, to adopt a more explicit position. This involves the creation of a regulatory framework, which takes account of the universal concerns of all the Member States in terms of the prevention of cross-border organised crime, which uses these types of games as a way of expanding, as well as in terms of providing proper protection to consumers who are vulnerable to this type of online gambling."
"Commissioner Barnier, we look forward to the new Commission, which is now taking office, dealing with this matter as a priority on its agenda."
"- (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, gambling has traditionally been strictly regulated in most countries of the EU."
"The situation has, of course, changed since the Internet became the largest gambling den in the world."
"It is a fact that technical developments related to gambling operations have progressed very rapidly throughout the world and the relevant legal arrangements are in the meantime incapable of providing a sufficient response."
"Cases related to online gambling are frequently referred to the European Court of Justice, which clearly shows that the interpretation and application of Community laws in the area of gambling are ambiguous."
"Internet gambling is, moreover, viewed as a 'grey area' of law."
"In my opinion, we must respect the fact that every state has issued gambling licences within its own jurisdiction."
"At the same time we agree at a general level that national legislation must not overstep EU principles on business and the provision of services within the EU framework."
"However, this means paradoxically that Czech law, for example, does not have to allow Czech firms to obtain a licence to operate online gambling but the Czech Republic cannot prohibit foreign gambling firms from operating on its territory."
"We cannot accept such a situation, never mind the social, health and safety risks associated with online gambling, or the related tax issues."
"(FI) Mr President, as you well remember, Commissioner Barnier, the European Parliament was being consistent in its policy when it opposed the inclusion of gambling games in the Services Directive, as gambling games are not services as such: they are associated with the risk of addiction and the social costs that go with it."
"The integrity of sport is also something that the European Parliament thinks is worth protecting, especially now that, with the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the competence to attend to this issue."
"The more unregulated gambling is, the more sport just becomes a means of accumulating profits and the more it becomes prone, for example, to criminal activity in the form of money laundering."
"The Commission needs to propose a solution that takes account of Parliament's consistent policy of keeping gambling within the competence of the Member States, on account of its special nature."
"At least a dozen cases have come before the Court of Justice of the European Union, the latest being the Liga Portuguesa case."
"Nevertheless, it is not right that these cases should only make progress in the form of court decisions or as a result of infringement proceedings."
"We need to have a policy decision on these matters, but one that does not result in harmonisation, because the Member States are responsible for the social costs and other adverse consequences of gambling anyway."
"There needs to be a logical and comprehensive policy on gambling, because online gambling is merely a facility, and in itself it does not mean that any policy on gambling will be a crossborder policy."
"The increase in online gambling is not a force of nature that advances inexorably."
"There are a lot of products that online shops cannot sell across borders, so the online gambling companies should also respect the law in the various Member States."
"Commissioner, I would like to encourage you to produce a green paper on gambling."
"That would certainly also provide us with the means to fight against online gambling services coming from outside Europe and the problems caused by gambling."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the previous speakers for their contributions and my colleague, Christel Schaldemose, for her work on this subject."
"As previous speakers have said, gambling is not like any normal service."
"The negative consequences of gambling cannot be more highly emphasised, as many colleagues have said this morning."
"There are two internationally recognised scales which can measure problem gambling."
"One is called the Diagnostic Statistical Severity Index and the other, the Canadian Problem Gambling Severity Index."
"This was used in the UK and it is estimated that, in the UK alone - and a Dutch colleague said one per cent of their population is affected - it is something along the lines of 236 000 to 284 000 adults who have a gambling problem."
"What would this number be across the European Union?"
"When you think about it, if this green paper is coming forward, I would like to see the Commission getting some proper statistics - a study in fact on the effects of gambling and online gambling on EU citizens."
"I think this would be a very useful piece of information to inform our debate and to have at our fingertips."
"Regarding the point about the ECJ rulings, when you look at the words, 'in order to prevent operations of games of chance via the Internet for fraudulent or criminal purposes' and the prevalence of cartels in the single market, highlighted by the competition report, we need to ensure that online gambling companies do not use registering in a different country from the one in which they operate as a front for hiding illegal practices."
"I look forward to hearing further from Commissioner Barnier."
"I wish you the best of luck, Commissioner, in your new role."
"Mr President, I want to add my congratulations to Commissioner Barnier."
"Commissioner, this is not the easiest topic to start off in your career in the Commission but I dare say that your predecessor, Mr McCreevy, would not mind me saying that he enjoyed the odd flutter."
"He enjoyed race-going and obviously was a man to place a bet."
"Clearly there are two schools of thought on this issue."
"However, Parliament's view is quite clear from its resolution of 10 March 2009, and I think it is worth quoting three lines from that resolution, which states that 'Member States have an interest and right to regulate and control their gambling markets'."
"It also very clearly states that 'online gambling operators must comply with the legislation of Member States in which they provide their service', and that 'a pure internal market approach is not appropriate in this highly sensitive area'."
"The problem for us as legislators, and for Member States, is that the market is way ahead of us: developments in this area have overtaken existing legislation and will continue to do so."
"Whether we like it or not, people enjoy gambling."
"Personally I would rather buy shoes, but others do other things for their kicks."
"I absolutely concur with those who have very clearly spoken about the problems of gambling, whether online or otherwise."
"There are huge social issues involved where people who have an addiction go beyond what they should do."
"But remember also that Member States promote lotteries, and perhaps that is a legalised form of promoting a possible addiction."
"So there is no clarity on this issue but, once again, the problem for the European Parliament, for the EU in general, is that there is no consistency across Member States, and yet our citizens are accessing services outside their own country, and they want to do that."
"The green paper would be most welcome: it is a big challenge for you to pull together the information on this issue."
"I think the problem is that there is a huge gap in information and knowledge, and it is up to the Commission to come forward with something to deal with that issue."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, it is said that politics is a game, sometimes even a game of chance, but gambling is not actually a business or service as such."
"It is associated with a vast number of social ills that attract criminal activity."
"Gambling addiction will all too often and too easily put an individual in a financial predicament, which can also result in very serious mental health problems."
"Echoing the message in my colleague, Mrs Stihler's speech, I would like to mention that in 2008 there were an estimated 40 000 people in Finland with a gambling problem."
"If there were the same number of people proportionately at EU level, it would mean that there would now be more than 35 million in Europe with a gambling problem, and that is a huge figure."
"I therefore think that Member States must in future have the right to decide themselves how they organise gambling in order to minimise any potential psychological and financial damage."
"We need strict rules, regulation of the market and public agency monitoring."
"I would finally like to stress how important it is for us to consider the protection of those consumers who are especially vulnerable and the dangers of gambling addiction and compulsive behaviour, and to make a real effort to fight against organised crime, which tries to profit by it."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations, Commissioner, and welcome."
"Everyone has seen how the online gambling market has boomed over the last few years, capturing economic and media attention."
"This is a phenomenon that involves new social groups and that is characterised by poly-consumption."
"Technology makes it easier to access and enables an increasing number of consumers - often young people, who are generally more familiar with computers and the Internet - to become involved."
"The dream of changing one's life through gambling often has disastrous consequences, and many families are dragged into a negative situation from which there is often no means of escape."
"Moreover, there can be no underestimating the serious harm caused by the lack of social contact and interaction of online gamblers."
"The loneliness and the basic invisibility of gamblers characterise a generally unacceptable addiction."
"Gambling is a vice that appears still today to be largely hidden."
"In my previous role as the chief executive of a public health authority, I opened a specialist department for pathological gambling."
"The proposed intervention model has proven successful because the treatment combines the therapy aspect with that of prevention, research and rehabilitation."
"We need to intervene by adopting a common position and ensure that all addictions are subject to a robust form of governance."
"This has not been the case: I am referring to drug abuse, alcohol abuse, tobacco abuse, food and Internet addictions."
"I regret that the question put by myself and a further 42 MEPs has not yet been referred to Parliament in plenary because of opposition from the left."
"I therefore wonder how much interest the Commission really takes in those who have a proven problem with drug addiction or another proven addiction, and how important a role the fight against drug trafficking plays in the Commission's programme."
"(EL) Madam President, the reason why we feel secure in Europe, the reason why Europe has been going for so long is, I think, because it has always respected national sensitivities."
"The perpetual dilemma which arises, as to whether Europe or the Member States have the first and last word, is a major issue and a perfect example is gambling, especially online gambling."
"The Internet is an exciting place, but it also harbours dangers which are very difficult to control."
"At the same time, the principle of competitiveness, which is the pillar of the internal market, cannot ignore primary issues of respect for national public interests."
"I think that what is needed in this balance is clearly set out in both judgments by the Court which, on the one hand, understands and defends the concept of public interest, as safeguarded by national traditions and, on the other hand, formulates objections to disproportionate measures which ultimately work at the expense of the citizen."
"Knowing the consultations being carried out at present in the Council, we are waiting to hear how the Commission will work to safeguard national autonomy of action and create an effective basis for cooperation, so that the question of habit and the question of fraud can be combated."
"To close, may I congratulate you Commissioner and say that I believe everything you have said in this Chamber."
"Hearing you say that you differ on the letter at the moment but not in spirit is something that I shall wait to see in practice."
"Good luck."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, welcome, Commissioner."
"It is nice to see you here and to see you sitting in that particular seat."
"What we are de facto dealing with in this area is, amongst other things, the implementation of the social market economy regulatory framework."
"We are in a state of tension."
"On the one hand, we need to go further down the market road, as we have to implement the principles of the internal market. On the other hand, we cannot abandon our sense of responsibility."
"It is for this reason that we have to set certain limitations on the gambling market."
"We must accept our responsibility."
"We cannot allow everyone to do whatever they please in the gambling market, any more than we can in the financial market, and then have society picking up the tab."
"What we are dealing with are questions of education, money laundering, criminality and freedom in gambling."
"We have to look at these things together."
"Nor do we have any clear definitions, either."
"We are all talking about gambling, but there are many different types of gambling, and there are different definitions."
"I, therefore, welcome the announcement of the green paper, because it will enable us to approach the definition issue, the problems and the variety of individual national customs at the same time."
"A pure internal market approach will not get us anywhere with these issues."
"However, we should not use one approach to the exclusion of the other."
"We need a regulatory framework at EU level, so that we do not end up discussing this every year."
"The Member States and the various operators are all involved."
"Working together, we should not undermine the law of the Member States, but ensure legal certainty in the European market."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are aware of the differences that exist between the various regulatory frameworks of the individual countries, and we also know that various interpretations of European and national case law are currently leading to a large number of infringements and disputes within the Member States."
"The lack of a European Union policy is no longer sustainable in the light of the challenges posed by the cross-border nature of online gambling services."
"Moreover, the rapid spread of the Internet and of electronic trade in recent years has given rise to an increase in the supply of online games and to the consequent emergence of cross-border issues, which remain unresolved."
"For this reason, I am convinced that the European institutions should rise to the common challenges, such as the protection of consumers - and more specifically of children - and the prevention of crime and fraud, but also to the challenges concerning the fight against the illegal and unauthorised supply of services, which the national governments alone cannot cope with."
"The Commission must therefore respond to Parliament's requests and strive to obtain a European regulatory framework."
"It must do so by showing the necessary determination."
"Commissioner, your good will is not in question, and that is why I say to you that the consultation is a good idea and that the green paper is also a good idea, provided that it is used to identify the correct legislative framework and is not just an end in itself."
"The old Commission very often drafted too many green papers and white papers without any decisions being taken."
"However, I believe that you realise, Commissioner, that we need decisions and not just words."
"Madam President, looking at the positions that the European Court of Justice, the Council, the Commission and Parliament have taken so far on gambling and betting, I would draw the following conclusions."
"Practically all Member States and Parliament reject the application of the country-of-origin and mutual-recognition principles in this particular and sensitive area."
"The Court accepts that, as it explicitly expressed once again in its judgment last September."
"For the Commission this judgment means that it loses one of the key arguments that it has used in all infringement cases."
"Member States are free to set their own policy objectives on betting and gambling and define in detail the level of protection they deem appropriate for their citizens."
"The Council and Parliament have been working hand in hand for years."
"In 2006 and 2007 they both agreed on the exclusion of gambling and betting from the Services Directive and the Audiovisual Media Services Directive."
"The Schaldemose report last year built on the work Council had done under the French Presidency and the same line has continued also under the Swedish and the Spanish Presidency."
"In the Schaldemose report I was responsible for the EPP line and I share her view."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask you this: do you share the view that the Commission should finally start helping the Member States in their fight against all illegal - in other words unauthorised - gambling offers, rather than consume time on questions that have been answered already?"
"If so, how will it be tackled?"
"(PL) Madam President, there is no doubt that the market in online gambling in Europe is developing very dynamically."
"Indeed, over 40% of the world gambling market focuses on Europe, generating growing profits."
"Over the last four years, these incomes have almost doubled: from EUR 6.5 billion to EUR 11 billion."
"These statistics allow us to say that this phenomenon is going to continue to spread, both at the supra-national and cross-border levels."
"Development of the services and Internet market and changes in consumer attitudes require a reaction on the part of the European Union."
"The lack of Community regulation of online gambling is only one example where the institutions are not only failing to keep up with social changes, but are also failing to react to the needs of the changing common European market."
"The dynamically developing gambling market, which is based on cross-border contacts and transactions, needs common and clear regulations, in order to minimise the risk associated with fraud, money laundering, match-fixing and addiction."
"Clear and transparent principles should be the basis of operation of the single market, and we should, above all, protect European consumers from these threats."
"We should inform consumers of the possible negative consequences of online gambling."
"Young people, as we said in the resolution in March, are not mature enough to differentiate concepts such as luck, chance and the probability of winning."
"We need to identify the risk of gambling addictions developing in young people."
"Increasingly often the Commission is not managing to keep pace, and not only in this matter, with the exceptionally rapid development of the Internet and various kinds of online activity."
"Is one of the reasons for this not the fact that the Commission is composed entirely of people who grew up at a time when this electronic world of online entrepreneurship was only the subject of futuristic novels?"
"The Commission must initiate work on a thorough report analysing everything related to the problem of honesty in gambling and all the legal and social consequences associated with this."
"What is needed is a clearly defined European code of practice, which sets the highest standards and will be able to distinguish between what is honest, sporting competition in games and dirty gambling."
"(RO) The regulation of the gambling market in the European Union is a delicate issue, regardless of whether we are talking about conventional or online gambling."
"The online gambling sector has expanded in recent years and is now an area where huge profits are made."
"There are those who speak out in favour of banning gambling, while others believe that this ban would result in an increase in these activities without any kind of regulation in force."
"Both the European Union and Member States share common objectives in their efforts to improve the regulation of gambling activities."
"They want to protect minors, find a solution to the problems of addiction, introduce suitable supervisory measures regarding transparency and rules on advertising, not to mention prevent addiction and excessive online gambling."
"With a lack of any harmonised legislation in this area, Member States are free to set their own policy objectives in this area and define the required level of protection."
"Although the aims seem to be the same, resolving the issue of regulation in this area is far from easy."
"However, we cannot deny the reality of the situation - gambling is an important economic activity which does not entirely comply with the rules of the internal market."
"With no restrictions provided by any technical barriers, these activities can be accessed across borders and generate profits amounting to billions of euros."
"The rulings of the European Court of Justice do not bring any closer the positions of those with differing views on the right way to enforce regulation."
"The Commission continues to face a paradoxical reality between Member States' jurisdiction to regulate this area and the complaints lodged by gambling providers against the restrictions imposed nationally."
"I am not an advocate of online gambling."
"I would say more that I am against this activity."
"However, I feel that we need to start with the reality that these games exist."
"This is why we have to draw up harmonised legislation which will not only regulate the activities of economic operators, but, most importantly, will also provide measures to support consumers."
"We must ensure that online gambling is handled in a responsible manner."
"We must protect minors and those who are vulnerable."
"We must also prevent addiction and avoid organised crime."
"(HU) First, a warm welcome to Commissioner Barnier, and I would like to wish him all the best in his efforts."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to sum up what I would like to say in three main points."
"First of all, in this age, when experts say that our world is dominated by mass media and the Internet, one cannot really discuss gambling and especially online gambling ignoring the relevant social, cultural, healthcare and mental effects involved. It is also clear, as indicated by the decision adopted by Parliament a year ago, that online gambling has obvious harmful effects on society."
"It is sufficient to mention the effects related to the development of addictions, organised crime and money laundering."
"We should not forget about the toxic effects of sports betting either, as even now Europe is affected by a terrible match-fixing scandal, unfortunately associated with this issue."
"Secondly, in my view we have got the wrong end of the stick if we think that the regulation of online gambling is a free market issue."
"This is primarily a consumer protection issue."
"In my opinion, regulation should focus on consumer protection issues."
"Last but not least, allow me to make two proposals."
"A common regulation is required at European level, a regulation based on consumer protection and focused on prevention, to prevent the development of addiction, the association of online gambling with organised crime, and the match-fixing scandals jeopardising fair play."
"Last but not least, there is a need for the European Union to initiate a regulation which reaches across and beyond the borders of the European Union, as online gambling is a global issue, and I believe it is an issue which we must also address."
"Madam President, like so many areas of activity, gambling has benefited from advanced technology."
"There are upsides and downsides."
"The upside is that it facilitates the punter and it makes it easier to get and to place a bet."
"It is a huge revenue earner for the Member States and we have digressed into huge areas."
"It used to be just racing and sports, but now we have got a huge number of other areas, for example political predictions."
"As we say in Ireland, you could bet on two flies going up a wall."
"So we have a huge advance in terms of the areas covered by gambling."
"The downside is that we have fraud, match-fixing, social and domestic chaos, gambling addiction etc. It has been estimated that, in the UK alone - as Gamblers Anonymous say - there is something in the region of 600 000 people who are addicted to gambling and who are members of Gamblers Anonymous."
"We have the same problem in Ireland and it is a common problem throughout the EU."
"I think we have got to look at the ECJ ruling in terms of saying that it is up to each Member State to fix its own rules and regulations."
"We need a common policy because gambling transgresses borders. It goes right across the entire European Union."
"I think we have got to revert to the excellent recommendations made on 10 March 2009, which are worth looking at again."
"For example, Members call on the Member States to cooperate closely in order to solve social and public order problems arising from cross-border online gambling."
"Secondly, we need to protect consumers against fraud and there should be a common position to do this."
"Thirdly, there needs to be a common regulation in relation to advertising promotion and the provisions of online gambling."
"Last, but by no means least, in relation to credit we should have a maximum amount of credit and, certainly from the point of view of age, there should be a definite age restriction."
"Mr Panzeri said earlier - and he is right - that we talk a lot here about resolutions and recommendations and they are all very commendable but, at the end of the day, what we need to do is to translate them into action. Otherwise, they are mere aspirations."
"So we are talking about action and we are talking about the timetable."
"That is the reason why I am looking forward to the Commission's reply."
"(LT) Probably no one would argue with the fact that gambling, like other forms of addiction, causes serious social problems that affect not only the gambler, but the whole of society."
"It is a complex problem."
"With the rapid spread of internet access in our globalised world there has been a significant rise in a new form of addiction, an addiction to online gambling."
"In the fourteen years since 1996 the gambling market has grown dramatically."
"Just as the market grows, so too do the general revenues from gambling in the world."
"Until we establish a common European Union system for the regulation of online gambling, the only people happy to see these figures will be the representatives of the online gambling business."
"The European Court of Justice has said that gambling services can take advantage of freedom of movement and that the Member States should regulate these themselves, taking into account their values and traditions."
"Lithuania, for example, is still one of those countries of the European Union in which online gambling is banned."
"However, the free movement of services ensures the opportunity to gamble, to have free access to online gambling and even if we ban gambling in the whole of the European Union, we still will not be protected from gambling registered in other parts of the world."
"Therefore, it is necessary to establish a common European Union system for the regulation of online gambling, taking into account the protection of risk groups, with particular attention to the protection of minors and control of transactions."
"On the subject of minors, it is not just gambling with money that they become addicted to, but often games which are aggressive in character and have aggressive content and this is also a great problem."
"This situation is almost identical to the question of CO2 emissions that we have debated so often."
"The Internet has no borders, so if we have different online gambling rules and provisions, it will be like the climate change problem; much talk and, sadly, few results."
"(PL) Madam President, I would like to put a question to the Commission in the context of the questions asked by my colleague, Mr Nitras, who is unable to be present, today, due to problems he has encountered in getting to Strasbourg."
"Firstly, I would like to ask the Commission if it could comment on recent legislative changes in Member States in the context of joint rulings of the European Court of Justice."
"Secondly, does the Commission still envisage taking legal measures to introduce common frameworks which could regulate transactions associated with online games of chance, having regard principally to consumer protection and the fight against gambling addiction, and also to the growing presence of organised crime in a system which is not properly verified and controlled?"
"In relation to this, does the Commission agree that, despite the common EU regulations in force today, Member States are still not able to moderate the gambling of their citizens, in spite of the use of bans, for example?"
"In this area it seems that legal regulations are not adapted to the current situation and the developing Internet service market."
"In relation to this, my question is as follows: what measures does the European Commission intend to take in this area to set down, perhaps, common legal frameworks, which would be the same for all Member States?"
"(NL) I should like to congratulate Commissioner Barnier on his appointment as Member of the Commission, and also to warmly welcome him here, as there is a great deal on the agenda."
"The Services Directive, or 'Bolkestein Directive', which was discussed here, expressly excluded gambling."
"I find this regrettable, as it means we did not dare to recognise that it constitutes a problem for consumers, and I think this was instigated by governments who were only too willing to continue to see it as a monopoly for Member States."
"The result has been a legislative hotchpotch that is currently leading to a great deal of legal uncertainty."
"This is regrettable, and behind it is a lack of the courage, including on our part, to look into problems."
"After all, having a problem but not looking into it is like burying your head in the sand as ostriches do."
"Yet these are real problems, as the organisations providing gambling services are constantly on the lookout for new openings."
"Our current legislation is based on physical borders, but we reached the age of virtual borders long ago."
"In my opinion, therefore, we must ensure a European approach to online gambling, introduce clearer legislation, involve the providers in this, and ensure that consumers are protected and organised crime precluded."
"This also means, however, that we must dare to let go of the situation where governments retain a monopoly on the basis of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling that 'monopolies are permitted as long as you conduct a restrictive policy'; this is getting completely out of hand."
"The ECJ also states this regularly, and I believe we must have the courage to take hard-law measures that eliminate the excrescences and the abuse of gambling; not only for the benefit of our citizens but also in order to preclude organised crime."
"I hope this proves successful, Commissioner Barnier: you have a huge task ahead of you and I wish you the very best of luck."
"Perhaps - and this is my final comment, Madam President - it is already quite something for you to hearten Parliament by actually looking closer into the implementation of the Services Directive; after all, I have heard many positive reports in this regard."
"(DE) Madam President, in case C-42/07, the European Court of Justice examined whether Portugal had infringed EU law by prohibiting online gambling."
"Portugal had banned companies from providing games of chance on the Internet."
"The companies affected by this ban, such as BWin and Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional, went to court and fought their cases all the way up to the ECJ."
"The main argument was that, in so doing, Portugal had infringed the freedom to provide services and that, ultimately, any entrepreneur should be allowed to provide services across borders."
"In addition, every EU citizen should be free to receive services, which is a passive form of freedom."
"In terms of its content, however, the freedom to provide services also includes a prohibition on discrimination, which means that the State is not allowed to put foreign service providers in a less favourable position than domestic ones."
"On the other hand, the freedom to provide services also contains a prohibition on restrictions, which means that any action which is not in itself discriminatory, but is intended to obstruct the entry of foreign companies into the market, is, of course, prohibited."
"Interestingly enough, the ECJ rejected this, saying that the freedom to provide services may be restricted insofar as it jeopardises the public interest, as it is necessary to combat fraud, guarantee consumer protection and prevent addiction to gambling."
"Addiction to gambling is a major problem right now."
"In Germany alone, 200 000 people have been officially categorised as addicted to gambling, and young people are increasingly falling prey to this addiction."
"One study has found that people start gambling as early as 13."
"On the other hand, and we are familiar with this problem, private operators who comply with stringent requirements and have appropriate consumer protection procedures in place are categorically excluded from the market while, on the other hand, state-owned gambling monopolies are allowed to avoid Community competition, which gives them a greater advantage in the market."
"I hope that this very difficult and polarised situation will be taken into account in the creation of a new regulatory framework and that the Commission will incorporate these key issues that I have raised."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to wish Commissioner Barnier well in his work, because we need some good work to be done."
"Gambling, by its very nature, has psychological implications for individual players and affects the cultural and behavioural aspects of individual societies."
"Given the risks that gambling entails, the recent European Court of Justice ruling, which grants each Member State the right to set its own rules governing online betting and gambling, is sensible."
"The ruling concerning the Liga Portuguesa confirms that the European Union is regulated internally by 27 different rules, on the basis of which each State has decided to legislate."
"This position goes entirely against the application of the law of the internal market, and against the gambling sector and harmonisation at European level."
"Supply that is not rigorously regulated would have a negative impact on the needs and the behaviour of individual EU citizens, and here I am specifically referring to the most vulnerable groups and to young people."
"We are asking you, Commissioner Barnier, to take steps to produce a regulatory framework that will clarify the responsibilities of, and establish common principles and a code of conduct for, operators, with the aim of protecting all those European citizens who have a passion for online gambling."
"(SL) Commissioner, I wish you every success with your new portfolio."
"Gambling is a contemporary form of addiction."
"We all know it; it is a kind of escapism for the modern man and woman."
"Nevertheless, online gambling is a fact which we politicians have to face and for which we have to find the best possible solution."
"On the one hand, we have to protect the principles underlying the European Union, such as the free movement of services, and on the other, we have to protect consumers."
"What direction should we take though?"
"If we place too broad competences in the hands of national Member State administrations, it seems to me we will not eliminate all the disadvantages of online gambling."
"Nor will we eliminate money laundering or other associated criminal activities."
"Most of all, we will fail to eliminate monopolies, because dedicated operators will of course achieve precisely that role within their national boundaries."
"I am against protectionism when it comes to gambling and wish your green paper could in fact solve this problem for everybody's benefit, for the benefit of consumers and national administrations and for the benefit of the principles underlying the European Union."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, here we are dealing with a matter of great importance in the defence of the interests of citizens and in protecting against the risks of fraud that are common in gambling, including online gambling."
"The Member States must maintain their autonomy and total legitimacy to legislate in the area of controls on gambling, according to the traditions of their own countries and ensuring a level of protection that is more appropriate for consumers and the interests of citizens, including investments in social areas, as happens in Portugal."
"For these reasons, there can be no room for the application of the rules of competition and of the freedom to provide services here."
"We are not dealing with a normal type of service, we are dealing with a game that has serious implications in citizens' lives."
"We therefore hope, Commissioner, that you will bear in mind this position in the measures that will be developed, acknowledging the Member States' complete legitimacy to continue legislating at this time."
"(GA) Madam President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to say a few words about this major international issue."
"Gambling - and online gambling in particular - is the hidden addiction and, unlike the other major addictions of drug and alcoholic abuse, there are no obvious physical manifestations of the disease."
"Secondly, online gambling is also the new generation addiction and it is particularly prevalent among young people who are far more digitally savvy than their parents and are therefore beyond detection and consequently protection."
"I welcome, therefore, the imminent publication of the green paper, which needs to address three things: firstly, to establish the facts on how widespread gambling is - as an example, in my own town of 10 000 people there were only two betting shops a few years ago but now there are 18."
"Secondly, having established the facts, we need an education programme for young people, parents and educators, and, thirdly, legislation which will apply to all countries."
"GA I wish you the best of luck in this important work, Commissioner."
"(DE) Madam President, in the debate on whether online gambling should be the sole preserve of monopolies, whether it should be made subject to licensing or whether it should be banned altogether, I think that we should not forget that the increase in gambling addiction has been very dramatic."
"As we all know, croupiers in casinos receive psychological training in order to spot players with addictive behaviour."
"If need be, they can be banned from playing."
"Since the immense boom in the amount of online gambling on offer, however, the addiction problem has, indeed, been increasingly moving to the Internet."
"It jeopardises people's relationships, work and health and, in no time at all, they can accumulate thousands of euros in debt."
"Protecting young people is another problem related to this issue."
"However, banning young people from gambling will not get us anywhere."
"One study has shown that one in ten students in Hamburg between the ages of 14 and 18 illegally plays for money on the Internet, whether in the form of online poker or sports betting."
"Nor should we forget that, besides the tragic fates of those affected and of their families, it also results in costs to the public purse."
"Commissioner, allow me first of all to welcome you, since I have not opened the debate and, moreover, to give you the floor to reply to these numerous questions."
"Madam President, thank you for your words of welcome, and thank you to every one of you for your good wishes and your encouragement."
"As you have understood - and, I have said so before this Parliament - I begin this new task that President Barroso has entrusted to me with great determination and resolve."
"I shall even remain a little idealistic."
"I believe that creative ideals do exist, especially when it comes to the European project."
"The question that Mr Harbour put very clearly just now, and the questions from Mr Schwab, Mrs Gebhardt, Mrs RÃ¼hle and Mr de Jong, in particular, all amount to this: will the European Commission, at this time, show resolve and initiative, and will it do so, moreover, by using methods other than infringement procedures?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake."
"Of course, I have been in office for 48 hours."
"So, please give my colleagues and me time to work and to present things to you in a serious manner."
"However, it is about a new approach that I really want to speak to you, and I do so for a reason that is very important to me."
"As several of you - including Mr Karas, and Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Figueiredo a moment ago - have said, this does not concern a service like the others."
"It is for this reason that you are right to expect this new approach from the Commission, beginning with the consultation I have just proposed to you."
"Currently, Member States are free to choose how they approach this question, as long as they comply with the Treaty."
"All Member States believe that gambling must be regulated with care, in view of the risk it poses to society, a risk that Mrs Schaldemose's report - which I have read with great care and interest - describes in explicit detail."
"The Council's work has also brought to light the significantly different opinions, traditions and practices that exist."
"What I have noted is that since they chose in 2006 to withdraw gambling from the scope of the Services Directive, the Member States have not been consulted by the Commission on a European initiative."
"It is this, therefore, that is going to change."
"For my part, my teams and I will be following the efforts of the Council working group very closely."
"I also know that many Member States want to see the scope of the draft directive on consumer rights restricted."
"I confirm that the Commission does not rule out solutions other than infringement procedures."
"To find the right way, I am going to publish a policy document."
"I myself used the words 'green paper', but for that I need to check the content and the scheduling of the Commission's work programme and to discuss it with my colleagues."
"However, we shall be publishing a policy document in order to structure future discussions on this question."
"That question, ladies and gentlemen, is assuredly one of a new and meaningful kind of European coordination."
"Of course there is an economic dimension, but I repeat that it is not the only one as far as I am concerned."
"There are other serious issues that pose just as great a challenge to the public interest."
"Mr Creutzmann, Mr Kirkhope, Mr PaÅ¡ka - I cannot name everyone who has spoken, but I have made a careful note of what the various coordinators of your groups have said on your behalf."
"One of these questions, one of these challenges, is cross-border crime."
"Is it possible to fight this sort of crime without taking a European approach?"
"I think that it is impossible."
"What is more, if we do not adopt a European approach to online gambling, we will not make progress in establishing an internal market for e-commerce."
"As far as online gaming is concerned, the very least we must do is to strengthen cooperation between national authorities regulating gaming in Europe."
"This is, moreover, certainly one of the issues being studied by the Council working group, which is why, on this issue as on others, the Commission will be working with the Member States."
"I believe that, in addition to listening to the opinion of the Member States, as I shall be doing, I shall continue to listen to what is said in the European Parliament, as I have done this morning, even though I have clearly understood that there are on the various sides of this House different opinions that are not always consistent, because I am aware of what Parliament's majority line is."
"I shall listen to Parliament and to all interested parties as well as associations within the context of this consultation on better European coordination."
"In any case, that is what I shall be proposing to my fellow Commissioners in the coming days."
"I have spoken of challenges and trials, Madam President, and I shall finish with them."
"Of course, among the issues faced by society is the question of addiction, which is extremely important and which has been highlighted in your report, and there is the question of minors."
"We must have strict limits, so that minors cannot gamble; all the Member States are working on this question, but in a disorganised manner."
"That is why, on this point, I believe that there must be European coordination."
"To do good work, one must first properly understand, and that is also why I accept the request many of you have made for the Commission policy document to contain figures and reliable statistics, in addition to the figures quoted just now."
"I am therefore going to endeavour - and this is what Mrs Stihler and Mrs McGuinness have just requested in particular - to ensure that, in addition to clear policy directions, which means not only words but also proposed decisions, the Commission document above all contains as accurate a diagnosis as possible of all these issues."
"May I say one last word, Madam President, on a subject that is also connected to this question of gaming, and that is the financing of sport."
"I say this, moreover, as a person who has devoted 10 years of his life to organising sporting activities."
"We are a few days away from the opening of the Vancouver Olympic Games, and I have the honour of being the joint chair of an Olympic Games organising committee."
"I therefore know that the organisation of great sporting events costs money and that, somewhere, financing networks are linked to gaming."
"It is for this reason, moreover, that many Member States that finance sport through gaming wish also to safeguard national practices or legislation."
"The Commission is currently carrying out a study on the financing of sport in order to better understand all these concerns."
"There will also be a conference to be held next week in Brussels, and in the policy document that I shall present to you we shall also refer to these networks which finance events and sport through gaming."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to you very carefully and I am very grateful to you for the diversity and quality of your speeches."
"I shall continue to listen to you."
"In addition to and together with Parliament, I shall be consulting all interested parties."
"Therefore, on the basis of this policy document, which, subject to the agreement of the College, will probably be a green paper, I shall make an appointment with you, no later than this autumn, so that we may achieve this goal of being more consistent and of establishing this marvellous form of coordination at European level."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner, for that full and encouraging reply."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"At the very outset, I would like to draw your attention to the significance of online gambling in today's world."
"In the debate which is currently taking place, we are dealing with several matters which, in my opinion, should be resolved as quickly as possible, ideally at Community level."
"In its ruling, the European Court of Justice stated that regulation of gambling law is a matter for Member States, and that they are tightening up regulations in this area."
"Not only in Poland, but also in other countries, voices are being heard which say that we should significantly limit opportunities to gamble on the Internet."
"In my opinion, this is a step in the right direction, and is intended to lead to the introduction of clear and uniform legislation, including principles for keeping the Internet safe."
"On the other hand, online games of chance are often played outside the territory of a single country."
"This gives rise to serious consequences, not only legal but also financial."
"The question as to which jurisdiction should apply, and to what extent it should apply, remains unanswered."
"I am of the opinion that since one of the European Union's fundamental roles is to ensure the security of its citizens, it should introduce regulation at EU level, and also ensure its effective implementation."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.25 and resumed at 12.00)"
"Statement by the President"
"Mr President, just to announce that Written Declaration 0054/2009 on the transportation of horses for slaughter in the European Union has achieved the required amount of signatures."
"Can I thank everyone else for signing it."
"It is brilliant news for us."
"Dear colleagues, today marks the 20th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release from prison in South Africa after serving 27 years of a life sentence imposed by the regime in 1984."
"(Applause)"
"As you perhaps know, Mr Mandela was the first winner of the Sakharov Prize when Parliament instituted this prize in 1988."
"Marking this 20th anniversary of the release of Nelson Mandela from prison, Jerzy Buzek, the President of the European Parliament, said: 'Nelson Mandela is an inspiration and remains in the hearts and minds of so many people throughout Europe, Africa and the entire world."
"Nelson Mandela's name will forever be linked to the fight for freedom, justice and democracy."
"Nelson Mandela's fortitude in demanding integrity in democratic life, human rights and reconciliation in relating to past adversaries has set the highest of standards for us to follow and aspire to."
"(Applause)"
"'Nelson Mandela's continuing fight and charitable work to defeat HIV/AIDS means that he remains a ray of hope for millions of people around the world."
"'Twenty years on, we uphold Nelson Mandela's message that: ""it's in our handsâ.'"
"), chairman of the delegation for relations with South Africa. - Mr President, I will be very brief indeed because the House does not want to be detained."
"As you rightly said, 20 years ago Nelson Mandela was released from prison after serving 27 years of political imprisonment."
"The world watched as he took the final stretch on his road to freedom."
"It was a day that changed South Africa and, arguably, changed the world."
"He founded a modern new South Africa."
"That he did it with no anger, resentment or bitterness displays that he is a statesman head and shoulders above so many others."
"He is, I believe, a living example, in that we are either imprisoned by our history or liberated by it."
"With his liberation, he liberated a country, sent apartheid to the dustbin of history and led South Africa to a multiracial democracy."
"We salute him."
"(Applause)"

"rapporteur. - (HU) I would like to say only a few words."
"On the one hand, I would like to say thank you for the assistance received from shadow rapporteurs during these very tough negotiations, for the assistance of the committee, and what is very important, for the assistance of the Spanish Presidency."
"When negotiations stalled, the Spanish Presidency put them back on track at the beginning of this year."
"The compromise is essentially that the Council approved the text for the microfinance instrument adopted by Parliament at first reading, which was important for a quick launch."
"The other important part of the compromise is that EUR 60 million is reallocated from PROGRESS and EUR 40 million from the margin, while financing instruments of up to EUR 20 million can be reinstated in PROGRESS upon recommendation of the Commission."
"I would like to ask the Council to read the text of the communication made in this matter, and it would be important to publish this when the text of the agreement is published in the Official Journal."
"We will have a very important crisis management tool in our hands."
"I would like to ask everybody to help ensure that this information reaches Member States, so that more people in difficulties can use this instrument to launch businesses."
"I can promise on behalf of both the committee and myself that I will monitor the launch and subsequent operation of the programme."
"We truly hope that it will be a success."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I think it is important that, on behalf of the Commission, I make the following statement, which Parliament asked for."
"The financial contribution from the European Union budget for the facility, for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013, has been set at EUR 100 million, to be partly financed by a reduction of EUR 60 million in the Progress programme."
"When presenting its draft budgets, the Commission will leave a sufficient unallocated margin under the expenditure ceiling of Heading 1a, whereby the budgetary authority - the Council and Parliament - may decide to increase the amount of the Progress programme by a maximum of EUR 20 million over the period 2011-2013, in conformity with point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management."

"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I propose that the House refer Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert's report back to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in accordance with Rules 63 and 175 of the Rules of Procedure."
"We heard the Council and the Commission yesterday."
"Both asked that Parliament grant them extra time, so that they can answer the requests that we personally formulated on the interim agreement."
"Parliament is right to call the Council and the Commission and the United States to account."
"It is our responsibility - even more so with the Treaty of Lisbon - and we must assume it."
"Parliament is right to put personal safety and privacy on the same footing, because there cannot be one without the other."
"By asking you to postpone the vote slightly, the PPE Group is not questioning Parliament's demands or authority."
"It is asking for the ball to be put back into the Commission's, the Council's and the US's court for a very short period of time."
"In fact, my group proposes that Parliament limit the time granted to the Council by demanding that the required information be supplied to us next month, not in May as requested by the Council."
"That would enable us to reach a definitive opinion in March."
"That is not unrealistic, especially as we learned yesterday evening that Commissioner MalmstrÃ¶m was undertaking to propose a new negotiating mandate for the final agreement next week or by the next mini-session in Brussels, which is to say in 10 days' time."
"A new mandate in February and Parliament's vote in March, that is what we are proposing."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would like to support the EPP's proposal for postponement on the vote."
"I believe that this is a sensible and rational course of action; the House may have new powers but we must exercise them in a measured and responsible way."
"The Council has tried to appease Parliament, perhaps not sufficiently yet, but they have also apologised for their mistakes during this process."
"So I think we should now take some time to cooperate and work together on moving forwards and towards a new long-term agreement as well."
"I believe it is in the best interests of the House's reputation, the future of our international agreements and the security of Europe that we now give ourselves this time."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, my recommendation is to vote against postponement as conditions for postponement have not been met by the Council."
"This House cannot keep falling for fake promises; the ball was in the Council's court but it failed to act appropriately and effectively."
"The Council has known about this problem for over two years and has done nothing in that time to deal with it."
"By withholding our consent on the interim agreement the security of European citizens is not being compromised."
"Targeted transatlantic data exchange will remain possible; the rule of law is crucially important though currently our laws are being broken and under this agreement with its provisional application they would continue to be broken."
"Parliament should not be complicit in this."
"Finally, the last point, if the US Administration would propose to US Congress something equivalent to this to transfer in bulk bank data of American citizens to a foreign power we all know what the US Congress would say - don't we?"
"(Applause from the Left)"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission would support a postponement of the vote."
"It will give the new Commission a chance to create a new momentum on this difficult dossier and it would also give the European Parliament more time to see how we intend to process this further."
"The Commission is committed to a very ambitious timetable."
"I would like to confirm what Mr Daul said - that the Commission will adopt the mandate for a new long-term agreement on 24 February if you agree to postpone the vote."
"I am ready to come to you personally the same day to present the mandate."
"The Council will get it the day after in Brussels in order to consider it."
"I am sure that the Spanish Presidency will do everything they can to agree to the mandate as soon as possible."
"The Commission will then immediately launch negotiations with the US to try to conclude them as soon as possible."
"We will, within those powers, keep the European Parliament fully informed at all stages of the process."
"My goal is to achieve a new agreement with very ambitious safeguards for privacy and data protection."
"I think we can build trust on both sides of the Atlantic for tracking financing, but of course this has to be done while fully assuring the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights."
"(DE) Mr President, I have a supplementary question for the Commission, that is, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m: Am I correct in my understanding, Mrs MalmstrÃ¶m, that, in your capacity as Commissioner, you support the postponement of the vote of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)?"
"May I ask why you did not support these requests during your six-month stint as the Swedish Presidency's Europe Minister?"
"If you had, we would not have had to discuss the postponement today."

"Venezuela"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Venezuela."
"author. - Mr President, Members of Parliament have been extremely worried about the recent clampdown on the freedom of the press by the Venezuelan regime."
"As you know, media freedom is one of the foundations of a democratic society."
"It certainly includes the right to receive information from multiple pluralistic sources."
"Recently there have been attacks on media freedom by President Hugo ChÃ¡vez."
"In August last year he ordered the closure of 34 radio stations through a refusal to renew their licences."
"This January President ChÃ¡vez ordered off the air RCTV International and five other cable and satellite TV channels who failed to broadcast his official speech."
"Furthermore he has described using Twitter and the Internet to pass on anti-government information as terrorist activities."
"We protest against the death of two Venezuelan students who protested against this shutting-down of the free media..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"author. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of expression is not a virtual right which can be agreed on without taking into account the political and social reality of a country."
"Freedom of the press to express critical views on the government or politicians whether they are presidents, pro-government or of the opposition, is the most important guarantee that people can have."
"This is about access to information from pluralistic sources so that the right to vote is a genuine one."
"Unfortunately, the reality in Venezuela is that following many antidemocratic acts by the government of President ChÃ¡vez against the opposition, it seems that it is now going to put an end to the press."
"We are not just referring to the recent case of RCTV International on which the Venezuelan audiovisual authority imposed a retroactive law but also to the fact that since 2009, 34 of the most popular radio stations in Venezuala have been closed down."
"In addition, GlobovisiÃ³n, which still maintains an editorial line independent from the government, is being put under pressure to change this."
"Let us not forget that the most perverse way of eliminating the media is to initiate self censorship."
"Following the shut-down of 34 radio stations, the government of Hugo ChÃ¡vez officially announced there was a list of other stations which are about to be closed down as well: a list which nobody is aware of because the procedures are not open, and a list over which a great deal of uncertainty hangs, the sole purpose of which is to promote self censorship."
"All these violations are taking place without the competent courts responding to the proceedings being filed before them."
"In a country where a universal principle such as that of non retroactivity is not respected, where the judicial authorities do not respond to any appeals unless the President tells them to, there is no rule of law and there is no separation of powers."
"Democracy simply does not exist."
"Unfortunately, this is the Venezuela of today."
"Mr President, I am sorry, but the motion for a resolution on Venezuela tabled mainly by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is a practical joke cobbled together in order to exploit the urgency debate for political purposes and to try to discredit Mr ChÃ¡vez."
"I will resume because there is no point in wasting time."
"Four national stations have failed to comply with their statutory registration requirements."
"They have been temporarily suspended and are currently complying with these requirements and I hope that they will be quickly put in order."
"In a joint motion for a resolution with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, my group reiterates its unequivocal support for freedom of expression and plurality."
"I am surprised, however, at the very varied view that the PPE Group has of that freedom of expression."
"Was it not you who voted against the resolution on the freedom of the press in Italy in Berlusconi's defence?"
"If you want to make fools of yourselves today, be my guest."
"There will be plenty of you at voting time, make the most of it."
"Mr President, I also have two problems regarding Venezuela."
"One is of form and the other is of substance."
"On the point of form, I must say that our fellow Members in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), who for some time now have been actively abusing this urgency session on breaches of human rights in order to hold a party political debate, are creating a complex situation."
"It is quite legitimate for them to want to carry out party political activities."
"However, this is not the right place."
"If they want to make statements of support for their friends or, if anything, criticise governments which they do not like, this is not the time or the place."
"However, let us take this urgency session in which we are discussing breaches of human rights and democracy a lot more seriously, because, if we do not we are going to lose all the credibility that we currently have, and this is clearly difficult to regain at international level."
"There are many flagrant cases of violations of human rights in Latin America."
"Let us also be more consistent."
"Do we want to discuss human rights in Latin America?"
"Then let us talk about Colombia and Honduras."
"How is it that those issues never come to be discussed here in plenary?"
"Why do we always have this problem and yet in a case like today's, which is merely an administrative issue, we get this kind of presence and support?"
"This is unacceptable."
"It is unacceptable because, I insist, we are losing all credibility and all legitimacy to be able to express an opinion on these types of cases."
"Let me be very clear."
"I am not a ChÃ¡vez follower."
"I am in favour of freedom of expression, even for those whose opinions are radically opposed to mine, be it here, in Italy or in Honduras."
"However this is not today's debate."
"The problem being dealt with today is essentially an administrative matter, a matter related to internal order in Venezuela, a matter which is being resolved and what is more, has even been resolved according to information we have."
"Therefore, there is not even a case."
"There is no point."
"If we wish to continue ridiculing this urgency session, then let us continue along these lines and we will just end up never discussing anything at all because we will have no credibility whatsoever."
"Therefore, I urge members of the PPE Group to let us take this urgency session a little more seriously, or it will no doubt end up being completely pointless."
"author. - Mr President, let me first emphasise the utter hypocrisy of the right-wing groups in this Parliament which condemned the Venezuelan government for the temporary withdrawal of broadcasting facilities for Radio Caracas Television (RCTV) and pretend to be champions of the freedom of the press."
"These are the same groups that stand for a system in Europe where the vast majority of the media is controlled by billionaires and major private corporations, who use this control on the one hand to reap massive profits for themselves and on the other hand to spew out pro-capitalist propaganda, pro-market and pro-neoliberal propaganda; who, in the context of the present economic crisis, vilify and abuse public--sector workers, for example, relentlessly pushing an agenda that it is working-class people who must pay for the crisis, and vilify without end those working class organisations that dare to disagree."
"Bringing the issue of RCTV into the human rights emergency resolution today is a major abuse of that procedure."
"By the way, most of the media outlets in Venezuela are in private ownership, actually, including powerful media corporations which conspired to overthrow Hugo ChÃ¡vez in 2002, who happens to have been elected and re-elected many times by the people of Venezuela."
"The reality is that the EPP in this Parliament has the same agenda as the coup conspirators: they want to overthrow Hugo ChÃ¡vez's government because this government has not carried out the bold dictates of world capitalism implementing privatisation and deregulation across the board, and they want no opposition to the neoliberal agenda."
"Yes, the working class in Latin America in general rise up in opposition."
"No, I am not without some sharp criticisms of the Venezuelan government."
"Despite massive support from the majority of the Venezuelan people, Hugo ChÃ¡vez, in fact, has not decisively broken with capitalism and led a movement to genuine democratic socialism."
"There is a trend towards bureaucratism in certain senses."
"Finally, co-thinkers of mine on the ground, in the Socialismo RevolucionÃ¡rio Group for example, are fighting these trends and fighting for workers' rights and genuine socialism, which means, by the way, that the media would not be controlled either by capitalist interests or by bureaucratic interest but open democratically to all sectors of society."
"Mr President, it is, indeed, here, in the European Parliament, that we should be talking, today, about what is happening in Venezuela, where a dictator is breaking the law, eliminating the opposition, closing independent television stations, expropriating businesses and closing a variety of institutions."
"This is the place."
"They are evident violations of human rights."
"However, there are still other matters, because his rule is not only destabilising the situation in his own country, but it is destabilising the situation in the region."
"Provocative action against Columbia, support for FARC guerrillas - these are facts which could actually lead to a real conflict in the region."
"Columbia is a strategic partner of ours."
"Let us support and be with Columbia at this time, when the country is being attacked so strongly by ChÃ¡vez, and is being induced, deceitfully or provocatively, to intensify the conflict in the region."
"This is our obligation, and if those attacks and the provocation intensify, the European Union and the European Parliament will be obliged to stand by Columbia, to be with Columbia and to support Columbia in a conflict with Venezuela which, I fear, may soon begin."
"Mr President, it is always the same: for a better tomorrow, to abolish inequalities, to liberate the people from oppressors and tyrants, to end poverty and destitution, to use the country's wealth for the good of the nation - someone takes power."
"This is the objective of every revolution, and also of those people who, using the mechanisms of democracy, take up the position they dream of, such as president, only the next day to throw away their slogans about liberty, democracy and society."
"From that moment on, they are guided by only one motto: 'once we have power we will never give it up'."
"Dictators achieve this objective using the same methods: censorship, secret police, prison for those who think differently, breaking up and dividing opposition forces and complete control of the media."
"A kind of founding charter, a symbol of exactly that kind of thinking in the 20th century was, for example, Lenin's suppression of the uprising of the heroic Kronstadt sailors."
"This diagnosis is also true, today, for Venezuela."
"Media freedoms are of essential significance for democracy and respect for fundamental values."
"The European Commission should take appropriate action."
"A few members of our group have actually already given their position, and I also agree that the Venezuela question or freedom of expression is not only relevant in Latin America but the whole of Europe and throughout the world."
"If we were to examine violations of freedom of expression in detail, I believe we would find that the problem exists in some European Union Member States."
"I definitely support the idea that this matter has perhaps been added to the agenda rather too quickly and that we have far greater problems, and greater crimes, not just in Latin America, but in other states and therefore I believe that today this question has been overstated."
"Mr President, I agree that much more serious problems than this exist, but it is my duty, for the sake of consistency, to also denounce what is currently taking place in Venezuela."
"I voted in favour of the initiative on Italy."
"A few days ago, I was here denouncing a case which took place involving the shut-down of the only Basque language newspaper in Spain, in the Basque country, and today I am here to denounce the closure of Radio Caracas in 2007 and the shut-down of 34 radio stations in 2009."
"I wish that they were only administrative problems and the rights of these media bodies would be restored."
"However, it concerns me to hear that President ChÃ¡vez equates the new social networking sites with State terrorism and to see how the Internet is under serious threat."
"It is my duty to defend people's rights, to defend freedom of expression, to defend the media's right to provide free and pluralistic information, because this means defending citizens' right to information with total freedom."
"(DE) Mr President, we know that Venezuela is one of the most oil-rich countries in the world."
"We also know that this country has enormous hydroelectric power potential."
"Nonetheless, as we all know, the population of Venezuela is suffering the consequences of years of mismanagement."
"For decades, this country has not been able to invest its oil revenues in sustainable development or in developing infrastructure."
"The pegging of the national currency to the US dollar was probably another counterproductive move."
"Recently, President ChÃ¡vez has tried to overcome this problem by depreciating the currency and getting public debt under control."
"However, the nationalisation of banks, expropriation and the temporary closure of food shops will probably not be sufficient to ward off the threat of runaway inflation for long."
"President ChÃ¡vez is pursuing a dirigistic economic policy, a centrally planned economy similar to those of other authoritarian regimes, which is undoubtedly and inevitably doomed to failure."
"The situation is likely to worsen even further, which will probably happen if food producers, who have been forced to produce food at fixed, non-market prices for years, attempt to rise up in protest at some point, wherever possible."
"I must also express my criticism of the fact that, in this precarious situation in which Venezuelans suffer from power cuts, water shortages and a deplorable economy, President ChÃ¡vez has bought over USD 70 million worth of arms for the National Guard."
"This does not augur well, in particular in the context of the continued protests following the closure of a broadcaster critical of the government, in which students and opposition members have time and again clashed violently with the security forces."
"Since, as we all agree, human rights are of particular concern to the European Union, we must make it our business to help."
"We must act, not only in cases involving violations of human rights, but also in exploring possibilities which could improve the conditions under which the population of Venezuela lives, without directly intervening in this country's domestic affairs."
"Much diplomatic skill and sensitivity is required for this task."
"I hope that the European Union is in a position to do that."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am somewhat surprised that, in this House, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) stands accused of forcing this topic, which, although urgent, is probably not to the liking of any member of the Left majority of this House, onto the agenda."
"I doubt that they constitute a majority in this House."
"I simply had to ask that question."
"Like all the other groups, our group is also perfectly entitled to raise this matter."
"Even though Mr ChÃ¡vez, who is currently in power, might be some kind of chum of yours or of the previous Spanish Presidency-in-Office, we still simply have to ask what action is being taken in this regard."
"I am quite amazed that somebody like Mr ChÃ¡vez can possibly say things like 'Twitter is a terrorist system'."
"I am sorry, but anyone in this day and age who describes Twitter as a terrorist system is living in another world, back in the stone age."
"Let me tell you this, as well: We, the PPE Group, will not be cowed by this accusation."
"We denounce violations of human rights everywhere."
"I personally denounce human rights violations when it comes to freedom of the press."
"On that score, let me just say that Venezuelan journalists are spoon-fed and dictated to and that judges are thrown into jail if they release someone who has been wrongly arrested."
"As Europeans, we must have the courage to speak out against such practices."
"I will not allow Mrs de Keyser and others in this House to pin this accusation on the PPE Group."
"Like anyone else, we are perfectly entitled to designate violations of human rights and freedoms, whether in Europe or anywhere else across the world, as topics worthy of debate."
"Mr President, the Venezuelan government has unjustly tried to limit free expression and pluralism in the media and on the Internet."
"These desperate attempts to censor information and expression remind me of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's behaviour."
"In fact President Hugo ChÃ¡vez calls Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a friend - and with friends like these, who needs enemies, one might wonder."
"Yet the fact that ChÃ¡vez considers Twitter and text messaging as acts of terrorism shows us that he considers people and the free flow of their ideas and opposition as his enemy."
"I am a user of Twitter and text messaging, I have to confess, but in Europe, thankfully, we consider free expression a fundamental and universal right, including on the Internet."
"Limiting digital avenues to expression, information and the exchange of ideas is testimony to the Venezuelan government's fear of its citizens and their call for an end to violence and oppression."
"The successful mobilisation of citizens can be seen in the example of Oscar Morales, who set up a Facebook group called 'A million voices against the FARC' with the hope of collecting one million people online."
"He soon mobilised 12 million people to protest on the streets all over the world calling for an end to FARC's violence."
"This movement was fuelled by citizens using technology as a vehicle."
"Trying to limit this vehicle is not only unjust, it will also prove ineffective."
"Mr President, press freedom and free democratic government are the foundations of the EU."
"For Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the pseudo-dictator of Venezuela, they are simply obstacles on his path to absolute power."
"He is a demagogue, not a democrat, and has ruined the Venezuelan economy."
"Yet, still, this House has its fair share of ChÃ¡vez apologists, like Mr Higgins: perhaps because ChÃ¡vez reflects their virulent anti-Americanism and their resentment of the success of President Uribe in neighbouring Columbia."
"It is lamentable that other political groups on the Left refuse to join with us in the political mainstream of the House in condemning the increasingly arbitrary and serious affronts to basic freedoms perpetrated by the ChÃ¡vez regime."
"His response to a TV station critical of his rule was simply to take it off the air."
"It reminds me of a similar situation in the PRC - China - where the Communist regime tried to stop a European company from broadcasting anti-Communist TV programmes."
"ChÃ¡vez has, therefore - unashamedly - identified himself alongside China's authoritarian and hard-line rulers."
"His closest friends internationally are dictators Castro, Lukashenko and Ahmadinejad, which speaks volumes."
"My group, the ECR, supports the Venezuelan people in their efforts to bring genuine democracy to that country."
"Mr President, the democratic and human rights situation in Venezuela is in constant decline and we have to fully recognise this."
"We should also be reminded today that Venezuela has been recognised by various human rights organisations as the country with the worst freedom of press situation in Latin America."
"Lieutenant Colonel ChÃ¡vez has failed in governing Venezuela in many respects but he has remained in power only by suppressing the opposition, gaining control of the media and manipulating the electoral process."
"I would like to react to some colleagues who have already spoken in this Chamber before me and to say that our responsibility, our mission, is to support the Venezuelan people facing persecution, human rights abuses and arrest by their President."
"(RO) In my view, Hugo ChÃ¡vez has adopted all the worst possible aspects of totalitarian socialism from the last century."
"I do not mean by this his attitude towards foreign investments which is also, of course, a major issue for as long as it is completely random."
"However, I do mean his attitude to freedom of the press and what is represented by pluralism, because Hugo ChÃ¡vez is attempting to copy pluralism, simply by closing down radio stations which refuse to broadcast his long-winded speeches and creating public stations to simulate pluralism."
"Copying pluralism is not the same as accepting pluralism because democracy cannot operate on the basis of a caricature of pluralism."
"People close to ChÃ¡vez have already been appointed."
"He is nothing short of a dictator because he hates pluralism."
"I therefore believe that socialists should not defend him."
"One of the victims of the recent demonstrations was actually a socialist student."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to endorse the view presented here, on behalf of my group, by Mrs De Keyser."
"There is no doubt that there must be no toleration for violation of media freedoms."
"We are, certainly, seeing disturbing events in Venezuela."
"I think, however, that we should be very careful about forming unequivocal, categorical and final judgments."
"In my opinion, we should be given an answer to a fundamental question: the stations which were closed down - were they all closed down for political reasons, or were some of them closed down because, in fact, they did not meet legal requirements?"
"I think an answer here, and understanding what is pure politics and what is legal fact, would have great significance for the position of our House."
"(FI) Mr President, it is rather puzzling how some of my fellow Members here think that it is not fitting to speak about one of the world's most corrupt countries."
"President Hugo ChÃ¡vez's opponents are still sitting in prison cells, sentenced on what are clearly political grounds."
"Is it not the case that to defend this state of affairs means an embarrassing humiliation with regard to one's own ideology?"
"The Venezuelans are also having to endure completely unnecessary power and water cuts in what is Latin America's most energyrich country."
"The closure of radio and television channels and the violent suppression of student demonstrations speak of a totalitarian regime."
"Why, therefore, should we not react?"
"As the media have to operate according to the law, they should not be closed down unless the authorities are left with no other option, and only after all the legal means available have been used."
"Accused people must also be given the chance to defend themselves and appeal against their convictions."
"If the Venezuelan government is committed to the rule of law and human rights, it must protect and respect freedom of expression and appreciate the joys of that crucial input that criticism and openness bring to a constitutionally governed country."
"(ES) Mr President, although it is merely an administrative issue for certain people, for others it is much more."
"We are talking about freedom."
"I know that for some people freedom must be defended in certain ways and in certain places."
"However, I also know that for some people, true freedom, their own freedom, is one that is imposed by certain dictators whom they defend and in some cases they even encourage and not the freedom of people like us who defend this word to its fullest extent, who believe in free media and who believe that land cannot be taken by decree."
"You should ask the thousands of people from the Canary Islands who have been subjected to this situation in Venezuela."
"We are talking about rights, plurality and freedom."
"Unfortunately, certain people do not believe in this yet."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission takes note of the draft resolutions presented by Parliament concerning the situation in Venezuela."
"You can be assured that the Commission is following this situation very closely."
"In this regard, the EU has noted with concern the continued suspension of media, including RCTV International."
"We understand that this is an issue that goes beyond purely legal requirements and needs to be regarded within the context of the question of freedom of expression in Venezuela."
"This has been a cause for concern and has been given high visibility at international level in recent months."
"For example, in November 2009, the special rapporteur of the United Nations Human Rights Council argued that the proposed special law against media crimes in Venezuela - I quote - 'would involve serious violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and would curtail press freedom in the country if it is adopted in its current form'."
"The rapporteur also called on Venezuela to fully respect Articles 19 and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Venezuela is a party and which guarantees the right to freedom of opinion and expression."
"You might also recall that, in 2009, the European Union issued a declaration concerning those problems, because for us freedom of expression and free access to information are issues that are part of the dialogue that we have with the Venezuelan authorities."
"We deeply deplore that two protesters died and several persons were injured, including members of the security forces and protestors."
"We share the assessment of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which has expressed its deep concern over the serious violent incidents which occurred in the demonstrations both for and against the government of President ChÃ¡vez and which has urged the Venezuelan government to control demonstrations - I quote - 'within the framework of respect for human rights according to inter-American standards'."
"We are closely following with concern the tendency towards political radicalisation."
"The September elections are widely seen as a milestone for the future of the country."
"In that respect, the EU underlines the importance of these elections being held in a peaceful, transparent and fully democratic environment."
"In the context of the dialogue which the EU is leading with the Venezuelan authorities, we have always stressed the importance of fully respecting international obligations and commitments on human rights, including freedom of expression and the press as a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law."
"As you know, this principle is enshrined in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights that is now part of our treaties."
"This puts a specific emphasis on freedom of expression and respect for pluralism in the media, in Europe and also in our international relations."
"The European Union, through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, supports the activities of civil society organisations in this very specific area."
"Furthermore we have continuously supported all initiatives aimed at promoting tolerance, spaces for dialogue and mutual understanding."
"In the name of the Commission, I would like to assure Parliament that we will continue to follow developments in Venezuela closely."
"Our commitment to supporting and strengthening democracy and the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms will be reflected in our cooperation policy and relations with Venezuela, in the future as in the past."
"- (ES) Mr President, if the 'catch-the-eye' procedure is to work effectively, the President should look in the Chamber to see who is requesting the floor, something which I have done very visibly so as to speak in the 'catch-the-eye' in the debate on Venezuela."
"You or your services should keep an eye out for those who wish to take the floor."
"Mrs MuÃ±iz De Urquiza, it is not physically possible for me to be looking in all directions at once."
"I am surrounded by very attentive people here."
"Anyway, when I gave the floor to the last Member, I also said 'the last Member to take the floor will be Mr Mato Adrover'."
"If you wanted to protest, you should have done so there and then."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I support this resolution, for I am concerned with the undemocratic measures taken by the government in Venezuela, specifically those curtailing the rights to free press, expression and assembly, as well as with the high level of corruption, as perceived by the people of Venezuela."
"Control of the media and of different opinions is typical for totalitarian regimes."
"As reported by human rights groups, in January 2010, the ChÃ¡vez government threatened to take action against cable providers that aired channels that did not comply with the government requirement to interrupt regular broadcasting in order to broadcast presidential speeches."
"As a result, the country's cable providers stopped broadcasting seven channels."
"In 2009, ChÃ¡vez forced stations to transmit live 141 speeches, including one that lasted seven hours and 34 minutes."
"As regards corruption, the government should fully and effectively implement the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the other relevant instruments, and take seriously Venezuelans' concerns about corruption - an indicator of good governance in any country."
"2."
"Madagascar"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Madagascar."
"author. - Mr President, this is indeed a topic for decision."
"It is a topic we have to discuss."
"There is a political crisis in Madagascar and this brings us to the necessity of responding accordingly to the necessities also of the country."
"The power-sharing deal has been negotiated under the auspices of the African Union between the current President Rajoelina and the former President Ravalomanana."
"There is the Maputo Agreement and Addis Ababa Additional Act, which remain the only political and democratic solution to the current crisis."
"We must not forget this."
"The Maputo Agreement foresees the establishment of a national unity government with a transition period of 15 months."
"Let me signal as well that, after this fact, there are some specific and local situations that are worrying in terms of the government issuing a decree legalising the export of unprocessed and endangered wood threatening the biodiversity of the country."
"This might cause a lot of problems in the future because they can be lost forever."
"In this context, we have to remind the Commission and the Member States that to send an election observation operation to Madagascar could be a mistake."
"We ask not to send a delegation to this country under the current circumstances, to the elections the current government is organising in March, as these elections circumvent the Maputo Agreement."
"I insist: in this framework, under this consensus and on the basis of the agreement in Maputo, we should not follow this observation election mission."
"This has to be accompanied as well by full respect of human rights in the country and full respect of democratic principles and the rule of law."
"If these conditions are fulfilled then we can talk about this, but in the current situation, in the current context, I think it would be a mistake."
"Mr President, problems of instability persist in Madagascar despite the initiatives of the African Union and the UN."
"Mr Rajoelina refuses to share power and is removing everyone who opposes him."
"He recently affirmed his intention to organise general elections without taking account of the timetable provided for in the Maputo and Addis Ababa agreements."
"It is no exaggeration to say that the anti-constitutional regime of Andry Rajeolina has taken over the three estates and is doing its best to take over the media as well."
"Unfortunately for Madagascar, the human rights violations by the previous president's regime have continued after Andry Rajeolina declared himself president of the High Transitional Authority."
"The security forces which he directs have frequently intervened in a violent manner to disperse opposition demonstrations and there have been deaths and injuries."
"In its report dated 4 February 2010, Amnesty International shows that parliamentarians, senators, lawyers, leaders of the opposition and journalists have been subject to arrest and arbitrary and illegal detention and that some were mistreated during their arrest, while the authorities have not conducted any enquiries."
"Unfortunately, once again, the facts prove that those who take power by force reign with force."
"Mr President, there is consensus on this motion for a resolution."
"The illegal transitional regime headed by Andry Rajoelina is in the process of plunging Madagascar into chaos."
"It is preparing to make free and easy with the forthcoming elections, which he has announced for March 2010, at the end of a process which has nothing democratic about it and which is taking place outside the Maputo and Addis Ababa agreements."
"The illegal nominations of questionable political personalities, the widespread human rights violations and the harassment and arbitrary arrest of parliamentarians, religious leaders and civilians have upset the international community and led it to impose sanctions."
"Madagascar's membership of the Southern Africa Development Community and the African Union has been frozen."
"The United States are refusing it the advantages of the African Growth and Opportunity Act."
"The donors of the International Monetary Fund have reduced their budget by 50%, the UN will examine the situation of this country on 15 February and the European Union has, I believe, suspended its development aid, while maintaining its humanitarian aid."
"The situation is therefore tragic, catastrophic, for a population living on less than a dollar a day."
"We are terribly concerned about this situation and this joint emergency motion for a resolution is proof of our concern."
"We support the mediation efforts being made by Joaquim Chissano, the former president of the Republic of Mozambique, and urge the four political groups to return to the negotiating table."
"There can be no other solution."
"We are also calling on the African Union and the Southern African Development Community to resume contact in order to bring the transitional process to a proper conclusion and we call on the Commission to report to us on the consultation process under way with Madagascar under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, there is concern in some of the world's capital cities that our motion for a resolution could lead to an escalation in the situation in Madagascar."
"However, our aim is to bring peace to the region."
"I refer, in particular, to Article 14 and 15, which are quite clearly focused on dialogue."
"The African Union, the European Union, the UN, neighbouring countries, the Contact Group and, last but not least, France, have all been called upon to play their part in ensuring that the four (at a minimum) different political movements that there are in Madagascar can find common ground, that Madagascar does not become a failing state, that it does not drift further towards catastrophe and that, instead, it finds a peaceful and negotiated solution."
"However, this will only be possible as long as nobody tries to establish a dictatorship there, nobody withdraws from the peace process and all the parties return to the negotiating table, or otherwise this wonderful, but ravaged, country will have no future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the same is happening in Madagascar as in numerous other countries around the world, towards which the European Union has demonstrated a lack of political power."
"This is particularly true in Africa."
"One year after Andry Rajoelina illegally seized power, the large island of Madagascar seems to be slipping deeper and deeper into a social, economic and financial crisis which its people did not need."
"In fact, this country has become one of the poorest countries in the world, with the large majority of the population there living on less than a dollar a day."
"Human rights violations are increasing."
"Religious leaders, parliamentarians, journalists and leaders of civil society are subject to intimidation and harassment and are being arrested and thrown into prison."
"The international community, however, has been sparing in its efforts, refusing to recognise that this is in fact a coup d'Ã©tat and that the government put in place by Andry Rajoelina in Madagascar is in fact a military government."
"Madagascar has been suspended from the African Union and the Southern Africa Development Community."
"Since 2 February 2009, numerous attempts have been made, including by the UN and the EU, resulting in the Maputo and Addis Ababa agreements."
"However, since November 2009, these agreements seem to have become mired down as a result of the divisions between the various protagonists and the refusal by some of them to participate in the implementation of these agreements."
"We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left consider that it is time to let the Malagasy people speak and that it is high time that democratic rules were respected."
"Andry Rajoelina, the strongman of the regime, prefers to organise his elections unilaterally, without consulting the Malagasy people, in defiance of the aforementioned agreements."
"He unilaterally set an initial date for so-called democratic elections in March 2010, but now appears to be talking about a date somewhere between the end of March and the end of 2010."
"That is why we want humanitarian aid to be strengthened, for judicial proceedings to be instituted and for the European Union to throw all its weight behind ensuring that civil society is involved in the steps taken."
"author. - Mr President, if the African Union aspires to have anything like the authority and respect accorded to the EU in international affairs, then Madagascar is surely a case in which the AU should act decisively."
"Instead we have seen the usual vacillation and tepid diplomacy following the fall of President Marc Ravalomanana, which is sadly reminiscent of the situation in Zimbabwe."
"It is time for the African Union to accept its responsibilities with regard to Madagascar, where political tension and chaos have been endemic for some time."
"If the AU cannot bring itself to sort out this mess, then it is reasonably fair to ask why the EU should do so."
"However, we should continue to remain engaged with Madagascar in order to facilitate a smooth return to democratic government and to promote reconciliation."
"It is vital that those politicians and military officers who have been cited and carried out human rights abuses should be brought to justice."
"Targeted sanctions against the illegitimate regime of Andry Rajoelina also offer an effective way to punish those who perpetrate the ongoing instability without harming the overwhelming majority of the Malagasy people, who must be heartedly sick of the tensions and sporadic violence in their beautiful country."
"As has already been emphasised, the state of uncertainty and political instability reigning in Madagascar has been going on for well over a year."
"While there have been some glimmers of hope at times during the negotiation process, the actions being taken by Andry Rajoelina only serve to hamper the process, complicating the restoration of constitutional order."
"I am referring here to the removal of the prime minister appointed after the Maputo Accords, the withdrawal from the negotiation process with the political groupings and the recent decision to hastily organise elections without taking into account previous agreements."
"I believe that this is an attempt to create a veneer of legality and legitimise a regime which has come to power following a coup d'Ã©tat, which Rajoelina cannot deny."
"It is obvious that the only way of ensuring that constitutional order is restored is to fully enforce the Maputo and Addis Ababa Accords."
"(DE) Mr President, I would just like to draw your attention to the fact that all the groups have endorsed this motion for a resolution."
"That is as it should be, because this topic is very important."
"In contrast to the previous speakers, I would like to say that we must ensure that we do not merely promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press in this country, but that we also actively demand them, now that we are examining ways that we could help things proceed towards a, hopefully, peaceful election."
"We have to ensure that we, as Europeans, establish freedom of the press in all areas, with all the financial assistance that is needed to make that possible."
"We also have to provide full support and endeavour to act together to provide financial assistance, within the scope of the agreements which we have with this country."
"(FI) Mr President, it is intolerable to follow the situation in Madagascar, where power is in the hands of a person who took over the country using violent means and who rules it in the same brutal manner, and whose position the international community has not recognised."
"That is why I am using the word 'person' and not 'president'."
"The majority of the population in Madagascar live below the poverty line: 7 000 children are suffering from serious malnutrition, and the situation is only worsening with the political crisis."
"For that reason, it is important that we, along with the rest of the international community, increase the amount of humanitarian aid to Madagascar."
"It is, furthermore, vitally important to investigate and solve the political murders that have taken place, and that must be left to an independent, impartial agency."
"Unless that happens, it will be difficult to build trust and take steps towards democracy."
"It must be a priority that Madagascar's four political factions can sit down at the negotiating table to agree on what to do to enable democratic elections to take place this year."
"It is also crucial that Madagascar does not conclude agreements on natural resources before it has a government with a mandate from the people."
"(DE) Mr President, on the subject of Madagascar, it is good that we can report that it is not just the European Union that is concerned about this country's compliance with Article 96 of The Cotonou Agreement, but that the African Union and SADC, as regional organisations, have also taken the position that another coup d'Ã©tat in Africa is unacceptable."
"For the African Union and for the regional organisations, it is a relatively new thing, not only to make these kinds of decisions, but also to implement them and to take action."
"I hope that when the International Contact Group meets again in Addis Ababa, a week today, on 18 February, all the participating parties will fulfil their tasks and powers, and ensure that any agreement reached in Maputo is also implemented."
"That is my appeal to all the participants."
"Mr President, may I start by highlighting our very great concern about the obstacles which are preventing the Maputo agreements from being implemented."
"Since the crisis started and since consultations with Madagascar were opened under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission has actively supported mediation efforts by the international community, which have translated into considerable progress but which, unfortunately, have still not resulted in an effective transition process."
"We are very worried because, rather than making progress, we are slipping backwards and there is a clear risk of returning to where we started in March 2009."
"You will agree that this may of course result in a deterioration in the political and human rights situation and in clashes between Malagasies."
"We have clearly indicated, on numerous occasions, that we reject any unilateral process which results in hastily organised elections that will not bring about a lasting solution to the crisis."
"Therefore, to reply to the question raised by the honourable Member, I would note that we are not prepared to support such a process either politically or financially."
"The initiative currently being taken by the President of the African Union Commission is our last hope."
"We are prepared to evaluate, together with the international community within an international contact group, the response of Malagasy movements and, depending on the situation, to present proposals for decisions to the Council under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"In the event of a negative decision, this should not affect projects which directly benefit the population and we shall continue and, if necessary, increase humanitarian aid for the vulnerable populations."
"Finally, may I assure you, Mr President, of the Commission's active, patient and persevering commitment to finding an amicable way out of the crisis."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"3."
"Burma"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Burma ."
"Mr President, the situation in Burma continues to deteriorate."
"Do we need to recall the abuses by the Burmese government towards its people, the interminable imprisonment of the Sakharov Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and her eviction on the false grounds of condemning the forthcoming elections?"
"The Burmese government has promised a democratic transition in seven stages, ultimately leading up to elections."
"However, if these elections are held in keeping with a constitution drawn up by the army, as would appear to be the case, the only thing they will do will be to legitimise five decades of military regime and give the army 25% of the parliamentary seats."
"We call on the international community, including China, India and Russia, to continue to combine their efforts and exert pressure on the Burmese government, both so that it stops the serious human rights violations committed in this country and so that the democratic transition announced does not turn into a political farce."
"Mr President, the announcement, in any country, of the first elections to be held for 20 years usually fills us with optimism."
"It awakens hope for the introduction of change and for democratisation."
"Unfortunately, probably not many of us, and not many of the residents of Burma, believe the elections which are to take place there at the end of this year will be democratic and honest, or will bring about real change."
"The Burmese regime is a problem we have struggled with for years."
"In our resolution, we condemn numerous violations of human rights and civil liberties, which are everyday events in Burma."
"We still do not know what to say to the people of Burma about how to end the regime's ruthless deeds."
"In my opinion, only joint action can bring results."
"Joint - whom do I have in mind?"
"Who should take action?"
"Neighbouring countries?"
"The countries which have a lot of trade and exchange with the regime, indirectly financing it, in other words Russia and China?"
"The European Union of course, the United States and the UN - with this group of partners we can bring about change."
"Mr President, since 1962 Burma has been living under the yoke of a military junta which is one of the most repressive regimes in the world."
"The last democratically elected members of parliament were elected in 1990."
"They have all been arrested or forced to resign."
"There are 2 000 registered political prisoners, including over 230 Buddhist monks who took part in peaceful demonstrations in September 2008 and who have been in prison ever since."
"Several tens of thousands - I should say hundreds of thousands - of Burmese immigrants are living in Thailand, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia in conditions which are often more than precarious and open to trafficking."
"Tens of thousands of people have been displaced against their will."
"In this sort of situation, journalists are especially at risk."
"At least 14 journalists are currently in prison and I should like here to highlight the case of Hla Hla Win, a young 25-year-old journalist, who has been sentenced to 27 years in prison for illegally importing a motorcycle because she dared to visit a Buddhist monastery."
"The junta has indeed announced new elections."
"Like Mrs De Keyser, I think that their sole purpose is to legitimise the government in place."
"We cannot but be sceptical as to the outcome."
"Today, we are going once again to energetically condemn the systematic human rights violations in Burma and invite the Burmese government to dialogue and to immediately put an end to the practice of recruiting child soldiers."
"We are once again going to ask the Chinese, Indian and Russian governments to exert their influence."
"However, Commissioner, I urge you to be our spokesperson to the Commission and the Council, so that the European Union maintains restrictive measures towards the Burmese government because, apart from words, we do not have the slightest tangible proof of democratic debate."
"We call on you to evaluate the efficacy of measures taken and to do everything to ensure that the civilian population ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"author. - Mr President, I have lost count of the number of times over the years in this House that we have debated the serious and worsening human rights situation in Burma, but, if we are ever tempted to soften our rhetoric against the brutal military junta, we only have to look around our own Parliament to remember why we need to maintain and increase the pressure on the generals."
"I am referring, of course, to Aung san Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and Nobel laureate, whose picture is displayed prominently on Parliament's premises in both Brussels and Strasbourg."
"She has consistently been denied a voice, as have her supporters."
"So the least we can do is speak up for them from here and promise them our unswerving support in their mission to bring about permanent democratic change in Burma."
"We have also raised the fate of the minority Rohingyas, who are once again bearing the brunt of a vicious campaign of discrimination and persecution by the army, and many have had to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh."
"The generals may simply ignore our pleas, but that does not render them any less valuable because, as democrats, we have a solemn duty to denounce such savagery wherever we confront it in the world."
"author. - (ES) Mr President, a few months ago I had the opportunity to visit some of the thousands of refugees, on the border between Thailand and Burma, who are currently hoping to be able to return to their homes."
"In some cases they simply hope to live another day."
"Whilst there we also met up with some of the opposition groups, among them the National League for Democracy whose leader, as also already mentioned, is the Sakharov Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi."
"On several occasions, I was urged to observe with great caution and not to support the elections based on a constitutional reform made by the military junta itself, in conditions similar to the present, which undoubtedly violate fundamental rights with regards to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, which also clearly jeopardises change, transformation and democratic reform in this country."
"It is true that there has been some change."
"It is true that last year, in 2009, hundreds of prisoners were released; however, very few were actually political prisoners."
"The serious problem is that there are still more than 2 100 political prisoners in Burma."
"Within this context, it is impossible to contemplate free, fair and democratic elections."
"It is therefore necessary to first consider that there must be a suitable environment for elections to be able to take place."
"Any dialogue which may enable us to improve the situation will be welcomed, but on the basis that these persons are unconditionally released and a guarantee is in place for refugees to be able to return."
"In this regard, I must make an explicit appeal to the Commission."
"The reduction in funds which are destined for this area and for these refugees is of great concern."
"There are urgent needs."
"We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who require our help."
"Hence, I believe that it would be a good idea to avoid cutting these budgets."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the human rights situation in Burma has deteriorated dramatically: political repression accompanied by military and sexual violence, children systematically being recruited as soldiers, 2 000 political prisoners."
"The first, allegedly free, elections in the autumn of this year are a total farce."
"The opposition parties are rightly going to boycott them."
"What is particularly concerning is the position of the Rohingyas, more than 200 000 of whom live in refugee camps."
"Many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh and have been brutally persecuted en route."
"I very much welcome Bangladesh's willingness to allow our EP Delegation to South Asia into the country on a fact-finding mission."
"We are flying to Dhaka tomorrow, in order to gather first-hand information about the situation in Cox's Bazar and the Bandarban region."
"However, it is already clear that, in order to survive, the persecuted Rohingyas need comprehensive international protection."
"The European Union must persist in its denouncement of the Burmese government's behaviour, until such time as signs of progress in the direction of democracy finally begin to appear."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (LT) Like my colleague Mr Charles Tannock, I would like to say that in this Chamber which, unfortunately, is always half-empty at this hour, it is not the first time we have debated the appalling human rights situation in Burma."
"Not long ago I myself spoke about it."
"I would like to believe that following today's debates the voice of the European Parliament and the European Union will have a greater effect."
"Why?"
"Because here for the first time we are talking human rights in the world now that we have the Treaty of Lisbon and the posts that go with it - among others, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, approved by Parliament."
"Now the European Union has a more effective opportunity to have a direct influence both on the situation in Burma and on the situation in other countries where rights are violated."
"On the eve of elections in Burma, I believe that we will only be able to achieve something if we coordinate actions with larger states: China, India, the USA and Russia."
"Mr President, to date, the appeals of the international community for human rights to be observed in Burma have, in fact, produced no result at all."
"There are still thousands of political prisoners in Burmese prisons, and the army continues to commit assassinations, use torture and make arrests."
"The leader of the Burmese opposition, Nobel Peace Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest for many years, and has also received a three-year prison sentence."
"This is how the junta wants to prevent her from standing in the coming elections."
"Burma is also a leader on the disgraceful list of countries where there is frequent persecution of representatives of religious minorities, including Christians."
"In accordance with the ideas of the junta, the Karen people, who are Christians, are to disappear completely from Burmese territory."
"Last year, Karen refugees fleeing the repressions took refuge in Thailand."
"Today, in spite of international protests, the Thai government is preparing for the forced repatriation and mass deportation of over 4 000 Karens, who will then be exposed to further indignities."
"It is our obligation, here in the European Parliament, to call for the rights of religious minorities, including Christians throughout the world."
"(FI) Mr President, in terms of human rights, Burma is one of the world's most fragile countries."
"The list of human rights violations is endless and the situation does not appear to be improving."
"In our resolution we have raised just a few issues."
"I feel that its main purpose is to make it clear that we know and are still keeping an eye on what is happening in Burma."
"We also need to express our thanks to Thailand, which withdrew its worrying decision to return refugees to Burma."
"Last week I made contact several times with Thailand after it had announced its plans to return these people."
"Karen refugees were being threatened with forced labour, torture, possibly enforced conscription into the army, and the placing of land mines in the area which they had fled from."
"It was with a feeling of relief that I heard that Thailand had decided to abandon its plans to return the refugees, following talks with human rights organisations and the international community at the weekend."
"I hope that the EU, along with the rest of the international community, will be able to offer assistance to Thailand as soon as possible, and look for an alternative solution to the problem of the Karen refugees."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, once again Burma is at the centre of motions for resolutions by the European Parliament concerning human rights violations."
"Once again we are speaking out to condemn the situation in this country, which does not seem to be showing any improvement in the way in which it treats its citizens and which is in sore need of democracy in action."
"While other countries have made progress over the years, Burma continues to freely violate its citizens' fundamental rights."
"Aung San Suu Kyi, the emblematic leader of the opposition, is still under house arrest, entire populations have been displaced, children are press-ganged into being child soldiers and people who opposed the regime in place are arrested."
"There are too many examples to mention here."
"We hope that the forthcoming elections will be held freely and that the opposition parties and anyone who wishes to stand for election can exercise this fundamental right."
"We also hope that observers will be able to verify that these elections are free and are not tainted by any illegality, such that the military junta uses the ballot box to legitimise itself."
"Mr President, the military junta has ruled the country through repression and committing gross and systematic human rights violations."
"As an elected representative of citizens, I call for free and fair parliamentary elections in 2010, to have a legitimate government in Burma."
"The current requirement to have at least 25% of the parliament as members of the military selected by the chief of defence services falls outside any common sense vision about what a legitimate government is."
"Second, I note that the government of the military junta signed the United Nations Convention against corruption in 2005 but failed to ratify it."
"Ratification, however, should only be regarded as a first step: implementation is the key when it comes to combating corruption."
"Corruption brings poverty and impunity."
"(PL) Mr President, if Burma has decided to hold parliamentary elections for the first time in 20 years, this may mean a step forward in the process of democratisation, if the elections, planned for this autumn, are honest."
"In other words, they must firstly be general, with every adult citizen being able to vote or stand for election, including Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and 2 000 other opposition activists who are currently in prison for political reasons."
"Secondly, the elections must also include the several million Burmese who, afraid of torture and death, have fled to Thailand, Bangladesh or India."
"It should be made possible for them to vote in their original place of residence."
"Thirdly, members of the Burmese army should not have a guarantee of 25% of the seats in parliament, because this strikes at a fundamental democratic mechanism and distorts the election results at the outset."
"Finally, the Burmese government must respect the rule of a secret ballot, and must allow the elections to be monitored by international observers and Burmese media."
"If these demands are ignored by the government in Burma, I think it will be imperative to continue restrictive measures against the regime in accordance with item 16 of the resolution."
"(HU) The military junta has promised free, democratic elections for 2010."
"It is important for the international community and of course, the EU to continue to put pressure on the junta so that the democratic transition actually takes place."
"We also need to make sure that the numerous ethnic minorities living in Burma are appropriately represented at the elections."
"This may put an end to the recurring ethnic conflicts."
"China is probably best placed to stand up for Chinese minorities, but it would first have to appreciate its own minorities: the Tibetans and the Uighurs."
"The EU can only be credible and effective in exerting pressure if it makes sure that minority rights are respected in all its Member States."
"As long as there are language laws in the territory of the European Union, and I do not refer to Slovakia only, as long as the law of collective guilt is still being rekindled in the territory of the European Union in a manner which contradicts the facts of the Second World War, and as long as the mere existence of minorities, their mother tongues and their rights are being denied within the territory of the European Union, the European Union cannot be credible when it seeks to exert pressure, and it cannot be successful, either."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, the dramatic deterioration in the human rights situation in Burma caused by the military junta is resulting in ever more brutal bloodshed."
"The persecution of religious groups, ethnic cleansing and expulsion, the taking of thousands of political prisoners and the torture, abduction and incarceration of political opponents of the regime are the order of the day."
"The new constitution, and now the pseudo-elections that are supposed to be taking place, will not, of course, improve the situation in any way."
"In fact, EU delegations and Parliament's self-righteous resolutions will also not achieve anything."
"What we should be doing, in politically realistic terms, is marshalling all of the Union's powers to exert influence on China, India and Russia to add their political weight to the pressure on the Burmese government to improve the human rights situation in this country."
"The EU should also call on the countries neighbouring Burma to bring their influence to bear on improving the human rights situation."
"(RO) Someone was saying earlier that we have already discussed Burma in this House."
"I think that we need to continue discussing Burma because it remains one of the most repressive and closed societies in the world."
"As has been demonstrated by various United Nations agencies and organisations committed to defending human rights, the systematic violation of the individual's rights continues to be a feature of life there."
"The current trend is to arrest people for expressing political views."
"Violent acts of repression have also been noted against those in opposition, whether from the student movement or the Buddhist monk community."
"I do not think that the organisation of elections can be considered at the moment because, first and foremost, a consultation process is required involving all political parties."
"Otherwise, without any free, transparent, inclusive process, democracy in Burma remains a farce perpetuated by the military."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, as Members have very clearly underlined, serious human rights violations are continuing in Burma."
"The military government has not responded to international calls to stop those human rights infringements and it has not released political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Pressure has increased on the Rohingya minority to force them to leave the country, and the deterioration of socioeconomic conditions continues."
"An estimated 80% of the population live in rural areas, and severe problems in agriculture and food production are developing."
"The EU has several times issued declarations condemning violations of human rights."
"The EU has also tightened sanctions and, in parallel, we have pressed the neighbours of Burma/Myanmar - ASEAN, China, India - to use diplomatic pressure too, and some of the neighbours are doing this."
"In addition, the EU has strongly supported the United Nations efforts."
"These measures have created difficulties for the military government, but they have failed to make it change its behaviour."
"Now the military government has promised elections in 2010 as a step towards its gradual exit from power."
"We can only judge these elections when the electoral law is published and when we see if clear and fair arrangements are in place for the ballot."
"In the meantime, the EU is willing to engage with the present government to persuade it to use the opportunity of the elections in order to change the situation and to start a positive phase in the history of Burma."
"By saying this, I make it very clear that the EU does not want to isolate Burma."
"We are, in fact, the biggest donors of humanitarian and related assistance to that country."
"The bulk of our assistance goes to the countryside - particularly to the delta - which is still recovering from cyclone Nargis."
"Assistance also goes to the refugee camps along the Thai border."
"We should also know that the report of the United Nations special rapporteur speaks a very clear language."
"We back the special United Nations rapporteur and are ready to help him."
"But we also know that direct activities on human rights in Burma are hardly possible."
"For instance, the EU will not be invited to observe the elections, so we have to utilise indirect measures."
"Therefore, human rights are built into all our assistance programmes."
"In order to promote our values - human rights development, dialogue - we need to have a very clear message."
"Today the united Parliament had this very clear message, and I am sure it will be heard."
"I am also sure that we should not outsource our task of reminding Myanmar of its obligations to neighbouring countries."
"We have to remain committed ourselves."
"We have to engage directly on our human rights agenda with the authorities, and we will continue to do so."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"Written Statements (Rule 149)"
"Burma continues to experience a very troubling situation with regard to human rights, as the Burmese authorities have prioritised their grip on power over the survival of their citizens."
"I should like to express my solidarity with respect to the suffering of the Burmese people, oppressed as they are by a military junta that constantly infringes their human rights by means of forced labour, people trafficking, child labour and sexual violence."
"It is essential that political prisoners, including the head of the opposition and leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was honoured with the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament in 1990 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, be released immediately so as to contribute to the promotion of free, just and transparent elections in 2010."
"For this reason, I urge the European Union to adopt a coherent strategy and develop relations with neighbouring countries, particularly with China and India, with a view to promoting transparent elections in Burma."

"The final draft agenda drawn up on Wednesday, 10 February 2010 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"By agreement with the political groups, I would like to propose the following changes:"
"Thursday:"
"Concerning the sitting on Thursday, the Group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament has submitted a request to hold over the vote on the report by Mr Lehne on annual accounts of certain types of companies as regards micro-entities."
"Mr President, our group had a very intensive debate on the Lehne report this morning."
"We did not finish discussing this in the group."
"That happens in groups sometimes."
"We would like Mr Lehne, as rapporteur, to give us until the March part-session to once more consider the direction we can go with this report and the stance that we as Social Democrats want to take with regard to this issue."
"There are different approaches in our group - I freely admit this."
"I would be grateful if we could conduct the debate, but if you, Mr Lehne, would allow us to postpone the vote until the first March part-session."
"That would give my group at least - although I believe other groups too - a little more time for a thorough debate and to arrive at an opinion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is good that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are looking at this in detail."
"However, I would like to say that Parliament adopted a resolution almost unanimously in December 2008 in which we called on the European Commission to submit precisely the sort of proposal that we are now discussing."
"Parliament must also stick to what it has itself decided and what has been the declared intention of this House for years."
"Because it is only natural for there to be concerns about one thing or another in connection with any legislative proposal, we have resolved the open questions by means of a compromise in the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"I should make it clear that this compromise is ready for approval."
"Nevertheless, I do understand that it might make sense to enlarge the group that are in support of this report a bit more."
"If the efforts of Mr Schulz are aimed at increasing the number of supporters, then I have nothing against a postponement until the next plenary sitting in March."
"That is my personal opinion on the matter."
"It is not the opinion of the group, which expressly decided otherwise this morning."
"However, I think we should give the Socialists a chance to reach a conclusion so that they too can do something to help reduce bureaucracy and the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises."
"(NL) Mr President, I would like to thank my fellow Member, Mr Lehne, for what he just said, but I would nonetheless like to ask that, in the circumstances, we be given a chance to submit amendments and debate them."
"At the moment, we have only a vote planned without the opportunity to submit any amendments to Mr Lehne's report."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to reiterate my request."
"There is no doubt that we are in favour of debate."
"We are merely asking for the vote to be postponed."
"However, in the interests of fairness, I must add that, much as I understand Mr Lehne's wishful thinking, our group is governed by democracy."
"Mr Lehne, I cannot give you any assurances about the result."
"(DE) Mr President, I will be brief."
"In the last few days, two important nominations have been put forward: the first is the representative of the European Commission to the United States of America in Washington and the second is the Special Representative for Afghanistan."
"Both nominations are controversial and there are various discussions going on about both of them."
"I do not wish to go into the question of merit just now."
"I would simply like to ask, Mr President, that, before they take office, both of them appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs to enable us to have an intensive debate there, and I hope that the President of the Commission and the President of the Council will give this their full support with your help, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the statement of the Council and the Commission: EU 2020 - Follow-up of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010"
"President Van Rompuy, as this is your first speech in the plenary session of the European Parliament, we agreed that it could be slightly longer."
"President Van Rompuy would like to present to this House his points of view on other issues, on institutional issues, at the beginning of his term of office."
"Perhaps 15 to 20 minutes will be enough for you?"
"President of the European Council. - Mr President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to take part in a debate with you not only to report on the informal meeting of the Heads of State or Government of two weeks ago - it was, after all, an informal meeting, with no formal conclusions to report - but also to take this opportunity to meet with you early in my mandate."
"Had I waited until the first formal opportunity to report on a European Council taking place at the end of March, I would not have come before this Parliament before the end of April, some five months after my designation as President of the European Council."
"Let me therefore take this opportunity to lay out how I see my role and function."
"I shall spend a few minutes on this so as not to have to return to this on future occasions."
"There has, of course, always been a Presidency of the European Council; not the same thing as the 'President of Europe', as some media put it."
"So what has changed?"
"Three small things, but which will, together and over time, have the potential to make a significant difference."
"First is the element of continuity: past presidents changed every six months; that is, after every second or third meeting."
"There was little opportunity to develop a long-term strategy."
"Our partners in third countries were bemused at having to meet a different Head of Government every time they had a summit with the European Union."
"Greater continuity is fundamental to building relationships and carrying out a serious task."
"Second is the full-time nature of the job; previous presidents had to simultaneously manage their own national governments."
"This meant that, at best, they could only deal half-time with European affairs."
"By creating a full-time post dedicated to the running of the European Council and its follow-up, including external representation, the European Council now has a better chance to play its role within the European institutional system."
"Third is the fact that Heads of State or Government now choose who they want to hold this position rather than it happening haphazardly from an arbitrary rotation system."
"I hope this, too, augurs well for the support that the President can count on."
"These three changes are all pragmatic improvements to the previous institutional architecture but, taken together with the fact that the European Council now becomes an institution in its own right, they give the European Council a better chance of fulfilling its task under the treaties of '[defining] the general political directions and priorities [of the Union]'."
"Some commentators have seen a great deal more in this role; others have seen less."
"On the one hand, some consider the Presidency of the European Council to be a sort of prÃ©sident in the manner of an executive Head of State, as in, for instance, France."
"Others, on the other hand, see it as the mere chairmanship of the meeting of the Heads of Government."
"In reality, it is neither."
"It is certainly not a President and not with executive powers in its own right."
"The incumbent must express the views of the collective Heads of State or Government."
"On the other hand, the role is not merely one of being a chairman, giving the floor to one or another member of the European Council to speak during its meetings."
"The task of preparing and then following up its meetings, and representing the Union externally - for instance, along with the President of the Commission at the G20 Summit - and the role as a bridge between the national capitals and institutions clearly go beyond the task of merely chairing meetings."
"The role of permanent President is to enhance a shared sense of direction: nothing more, nothing less."
"Where are we going?"
"How to deal with our neighbours?"
"Who are our main strategic partners in the world?"
"Where do we want to be in 10 or 20 years' time?"
"These are vital issues."
"As regards my relationship with the European Parliament, the treaty is quite brief on this: it simply requires that I report to you 'after [...] meetings of the European Council'."
"That means a minimum of four times a year, though in most years, that is more likely to be five or six and may, in the future, rise to 10."
"It will not be long before many of you will be fed up with the sight of me!"
"I will continue to multiply other usual contacts with Members of Parliament, such as the meetings I have begun with leaders of groups and the monthly meeting I have with the President of Parliament."
"Indeed, my role should not be confused with that of the President of the Commission."
"Mr Barroso chairs an executive that is elected by and is accountable to the European Parliament."
"It submits legislative and budgetary proposals to you, I do not do so."
"The Commission President has an intimate day-to-day contact with the European Parliament, not least working on those legislative and budgetary proposals."
"My task is, rather, to ensure that the Heads of State or Government can collectively agree on an overall strategy for the European Union, both as regards its internal development and in terms of its external relations."
"I have a weekly meeting with President Barroso."
"We are both acutely aware of the need to avoid any conflicts of competence or misunderstandings as to who is responsible for what."
"Public opinion and third countries may well find it difficult to grasp the difference between the President of the Commission and the President of the European Council;"
"I am very confident that we are on the right track."
"In this context, it is also important to remember that I am President of the European Council and not of the Council of Ministers; these are two separate institutions."
"The ordinary Council, which is the other branch of the legislature with the European Parliament, will still be chaired by a Presidency that continues to rotate every six months among the Member States."
"Only in the configuration of foreign affairs where it coordinates executive power does it have a permanent president in the form of Catherine Ashton, Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative for Foreign Policy."
"I pause at this point to pay tribute to the work being done by Catherine Ashton."
"In facing up to multiple challenges in the field of foreign affairs and security and in preparing the External Action Service, she deserves our support."
"It will be my privilege to work closely with her in representing the Union externally."
"Let me just say a few words about the European Council itself."
"The first formal meeting under my chairmanship will take place at the end of next month."
"We did, however, have a useful informal gathering of Heads of State or Government earlier this month at the BibliothÃ¨que Solvay, just a few hundred metres from here."
"Whether it was because of the more intimate surroundings of the library or the physical proximity of Parliament, our discussions were fruitful."
"As I said, I cannot report any formal conclusions to you from an informal meeting."
"At most, I can share with you my own personal conclusions from the discussions which I have set out in a letter to the members of the European Council and which I know has been circulated within Parliament."
"My aim with this informal Council was mainly to prepare our future deliberations on the issue of how to improve Europe's economic performance as we exit the immediate economic crisis."
"This involves looking at our targets and ambitions - and we have a very useful paper from Commission President Barroso on this - but also how to improve our governance of these issues."
"How we go about managing our integrated European economy - the world's largest market - in order to improve our economic performance is one of the central questions facing the European Union."
"Our initial exchange of views on this involved looking at how we set targets, how we follow them up, how we evaluate results."
"It is in large part about coordinating the exercise of national competences whilst making full use of the European Union competences and instruments available."
"It is therefore a task to which the European Council is eminently suited."
"At the Solvay meeting, all members of the European Council agreed that we need better, more focused economic coordination in the Union, both for major economic policy - certainly in the euro area - and for micro-economic policy."
"A lot of this is very technical, but let us just take the idea of bringing down the number of common economic objectives to concentrate on four or five."
"These objectives should be quantifiable and divisible in national set objectives; it makes no sense to have scoreboards on, say, 65 different sets of data."
"Moreover, all members of the European Council are willing to take more responsibility in a common European strategy for growth and jobs."
"Such personal involvement is indispensable; we need to go from paper recommendations to real-life commitment."
"I was glad to find such a level of ambition around the table."
"Whether you want to call it better coordination, better governance, or even a gouvernement Ã©conomique, the key is the common commitment to success."
"We also had a quick discussion on how to better implement Europe's actions in the reconstruction of Haiti; we want to take this discussion further with an eye to better implementing Article 214 of the Treaty on the coordination of humanitarian aid."
"A discussion on how Europe should respond strategically to the Copenhagen conference on climate change will be pursued at the next European Council."
"Unexpectedly, of course, there was a discussion on the situation in Greece."
"I took it upon myself to ensure that this was handled in the European Union's institutional framework and not outside it, and that the agreement reached met with the approval of all 27 Heads of State or Government as well as the President of the Commission and the President of the European Central Bank."
"This degree of consensus was a message about Greece's acceptance of its responsibility to cut its deficit in a credible way and of our solidarity with it if needed."
"I very much look forward to hearing your views on all these matters, not least on how we can face all the challenges facing our Union."
"I can assure you that I have one overriding goal for the coming years; to ensure that our Union is on track to be strong enough internally to maintain our own social model and externally to defend our interests and project our values."
"I think that all European institutions can, and must, work together for those goals."
"(Applause)"
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first of all congratulate President Van Rompuy on what was a very good informal European Council for the first time under his chairmanship."
"After reaching agreement among all of us on an important statement on Greece, we discussed the Europe 2020 strategy - a strategy for sustainable growth and employment."
"I had the opportunity to focus on the substantive policy issues we are facing, on the challenges, and on the lines which the Commission will formally propose next Wednesday."
"Before the crisis, the European economy was making progress: we saw 18 million new jobs and a more dynamic business environment."
"However, these gains have been wiped out by the financial crisis and its impact on many of our areas of activity: a 4% fall in GDP in a single year, unemployment shooting up to 10%, a huge hit to our prosperity, a real threat to our societies."
"At the same time, the task is getting tougher: we have an ageing population, a growing productivity gap with our competitors, and failings in education and research."
"However, we also have many strengths: we have the world's biggest market economy; we have the single market; we have the euro area."
"All this has proved to be an important asset in the crisis."
"But today, Europe faces a very important choice; I would say a defining choice for future generations."
"Hoping for a return of the good old days is no option."
"One option is limited change - the lowest common denominator which brings some reform and some growth."
"But we could never get back what we lost in the crisis."
"This option would result in a Europe which is second class in the new global order."
"Minimal changes, some kind of adaptations."
"I believe we can and must be more ambitious."
"We can aspire to an economic strategy that puts Europe on the path to competitiveness and that can create millions of new jobs."
"But this cannot be done by half measures and incremental change."
"We need to instil a sense of urgency, a recognition that business as usual will not protect our European way of life and will not defend our social models."
"On the contrary. Those social models will be put at risk if we do not adapt to a much more challenging global environment."
"This requires a joint effort."
"We need the Member States; we need the European institutions; we need stakeholders and society at large; and we need specifically the active involvement and support of this Parliament, the European Parliament, for shaping this strategy and for communicating it to the people."
"Next week, the Commission will set out the key elements of the strategy that it will formally propose to the European institutions."
"It will centre on three priorities: smart growth, inclusive growth, sustainable growth."
"First, the core driver of growth must be knowledge; knowledge and innovation that produces tomorrow's ideas, tomorrow's skills, tomorrow's technologies."
"Second, to keep in force our European model of society, we need to deliver more jobs."
"Our goal must be healthy, prosperous, secure societies, where everyone feels they can play their part."
"That means giving people jobs and skills and it means tackling the scourge of poverty head on."
"The problem of poverty is not only a national problem; it is a problem for which we need a common European response."
"Our social market economy must be hardwired to seize the opportunities of the future."
"I am talking about sustainable growth, recognising the importance of tackling climate change, recognising the pressure on resources."
"With this, I mean a competitive economy, deepening the internal market, creating better conditions for investment - especially for SMEs - a European economy able to hold its own in a globalised market place."
"These priorities are not unfamiliar."
"But the fact that we have not yet succeeded in realising these goals makes them more important, not less."
"Where we need to make a radical change is not in our prescription of what the European economy needs, but in our approach on how to make it happen."
"What do we need in order to succeed?"
"Firstly, the strategy must be comprehensive."
"We cannot have a pick-and-mix strategy allowing everyone to do the easy parts, the feel-good things, and leave the real challenges to the others."
"There are still many issues: when I think about completing the single market, about the quality of our taxation systems, about the way we spend money at a time of intense pressure on public finances, to name but a few."
"Secondly, our strategy must engage all parts of our societies."
"We will not succeed in putting European society on the right track for the future if this comes at the cost of social conflict."
"That is why a proactive approach to creating jobs and addressing the scourge of poverty are essential."
"It is also why we have been wise to reform financial markets."
"We want a strong financial sector able to finance innovation and help businesses to grow: one which acknowledges its broader responsibilities to society and governments which came to its aid at the time of need; one which accepts that effective supervision at European level is necessary today."
"Thirdly, we must not confuse having an overall vision for the European economy with the question of 'who does what?'."
"It should not be a question of a debate on competences."
"What we have to see is the added value of a European approach."
"It is quite evident at a time of globalisation, when we need to discuss with America, with China, with Russia, with others, that there is added value in a common approach; for instance, in the G20, an initiative that was in fact launched by the European Union during the French Presidency by the President of France and myself, when we proposed to the American President to accept those summits."
"It is indeed necessary to recognise that we have greater influence if we act together."
"It makes no sense to recognise global interdependence and to reject European interdependence."
"That is why we need to act together."
"Still, a lot of action will have to come at national level."
"Of course, there are national responsibilities which we expect to be addressed mainly by governments, but we also expect governments to commit sincerely to a European approach."
"The European approach is necessary, not to bring back powers in Brussels - this is not our intention at all - but to help the indispensable reforms in our societies so that they can bring more prosperity, more well-being to our citizens."
"We will only succeed if we are ready to work together, not against each other, and therefore we need credible ownership at all levels."
"We need strong and true coordination in the economic field."
"The Lisbon Treaty gives us these instruments and we will use them."
"In this European Council, I saw awareness of this problem."
"I can compare the discussions this time with the discussions five years ago when we were discussing the Lisbon Strategy."
"Let me tell you very frankly and very openly that I saw among Heads of State or Government much more awareness of the need to act together and also of the external constraints on the European economy."
"I sincerely hope that this time, narrow national interests will not again resist the need for closer coordination and an effective system of European governance."
"We also need significant European Union level flagship measures to typify what we are trying to achieve: some concrete plans."
"We are going to present some of them: projects like an Innovation Plan, a new skills programme, a proper industrial policy, a digital agenda, green technologies, and a specific plan or action against poverty; projects that have a value, an impact in themselves; projects that show why Europe provides part of the solution and which show that the European Union is not just talking, it is acting."
"Let me finish by calling upon you, the European Parliament, to show your strong support for these projects as legislator, as budgetary authority and as champion of European action in every corner of the European Union."
"Mr President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council of 11 February was the first to be convened and presided over by Mr Van Rompuy, whom I would like to welcome on his first appearance in the plenary session of the European Parliament."
"Mr Van Rompuy, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) expects a lot of you."
"I welcome the positive and pragmatic spirit of your speeches since your nomination, and I appreciate the tone that you want to set in the European Council, but I expect you and the Council of Ministers to be aware that with the Treaty of Lisbon, your relations with us, the MEPs, have changed."
"We are equal decision makers, and that has not only legal consequences, but political ones as well."
"Now I would like to come to the substance of the debates of 11 February, which is, of course, the 2020 strategy, but it is also the euro and economic and budgetary policy, since speculation against the Greek debt and the euro were certainly unexpected guests in the Solvay library."
"I would like to put the following question: is the weakening of our common currency solely due to the Greek crisis, or is the euro the target of direct attacks by those who are unhappy about its power and that of the Member States involved?"
"Secondly, are we going to wait until the situation in certain euro area countries deteriorates before we react, as we did with Greece?"
"If not, what plans are there to put things right in the countries most at risk?"
"A question for you there, President Van Rompuy."
"I ask these questions because, while I am happy with the solidarity measures taken on 11 February, I seriously doubt whether we Europeans are really on top of the situation."
"What is the situation, if not the fact that the Greek warning has shown the extent to which we must take courageous decisions to finally make sure that our currency, the euro, reflects the political power behind it?"
"Of course, we talk a great deal, we talk about economic governance, we also talk about monetary governance, but we could make matters a great deal simpler and certainly more effective if we devised and implemented real budgetary coordination of the euro area members."
"The former French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, has himself recently recognised the need to abandon sovereignty in some areas - something that is not easy for a Frenchman - and has spoken in favour of the national budgets of the euro area States being approved by the Eurogroup even before being submitted to the national parliaments."
"I would like to take up this bold idea, and I ask the European Council to consider it and to analyse it seriously."
"By properly coordinating their budgets, the euro area States would acquire unprecedented influence and room for manoeuvre."
"This power would mean that they have a strong influence on the development of new global regulations, but it would also demand that the European forces unite within the international financial organisations, where the euro must speak with one voice."
"Let me cite a striking example - which was mentioned by Mr Barroso I believe - that of the IMF, where the voting rights are calculated according to the economic weight of the states."
"With these criteria, the United States enjoys 16.7% of the voting rights, Japan 6%, China 3.6% and the six founding members of the European Union 18.49%."
"However, if they presented a united front to the IMF, the euro area countries would represent 23% of the votes, and all the countries of the European Union, still united, would represent 32% of the votes, that is to say, twice as many as the United States."
"Presidents, ladies and gentlemen, that is the reality of the balance of power in the world."
"However, because it is still divided, Europe is unable to punch its full weight."
"Can we tolerate this any more?"
"The PPE Group does not think so."
"It is time, President Van Rompuy, for the euro area countries to open their eyes to this state of affairs and to learn from it."
"They would then be prepared for what they will soon have to do out of necessity, namely, truly unite instead of clinging to this facade of economic sovereignty, which is nothing but a dangerous pretence."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, since the start of the economic and social crisis, over seven million people have joined the unemployment lines in Europe."
"By the end of this year, it is quite likely that over 25 million people will be unemployed."
"The good health of our economies and public finances, which we have striven so hard to put in order since the early 1990s, has been ruined in less than two years."
"Despite costly recovery measures, all we have managed to avoid so far is a complete collapse of the system."
"Economic growth remains extremely weak, and many people have lost faith in the idea of an early recovery."
"Fears for the future trouble our societies, inequalities of all kinds have widened and some of our Member States are in desperate need of EU-wide solidarity and protection, having become the targets of ruthless and uncontrolled speculation."
"The crisis has gravely undermined Europe's global competitiveness and weakened its political influence."
"That is the gloomy landscape in which Europe now needs to reinvent its future in order to safeguard its model of economic and social development."
"President Barroso, you are going to be asking the Spring Council where we want Europe to be in 2020."
"That is a very important question, but can we afford to argue about the distant future without first providing an answer to those millions of Europeans who are now feeling the impact of the crisis on their lives and who worry what will happen to their lives tomorrow - will they have a job; will they have the prospect of finding a new job?"
"What answers can you give them?"
"I cannot go back to my region tomorrow and tell my people that they do not need to worry, that we have a plan for 2020."
"I need to answer their immediate worries and fears, and I want to be able to tell them that they will be able to keep their jobs, that new jobs will soon start to be created and that these jobs will be decent jobs with decent salaries."
"At the moment, the only medium-term policy agenda is that set down by the European Council in December: the consolidation of public finances."
"By 2011, Member States are expected to start consolidation to bring their public deficits within the 3% limit within two years."
"At the same time, unemployment will still be rising; growth will be too weak to bring unemployment down."
"There are other ways to pull Europe out of the crisis: putting people at the heart of our policy agenda and especially those who have been most hit by the crisis."
"I would urge President Van Rompuy and President Barroso to reconsider the nature of the so-called exit strategy."
"Europe should choose a morally decent way out of this crisis: a human way based on our fundamental values - which actually is also a smarter way in economic terms."
"This will not be the case if macro-economic policy is totally focused on rapid consolidation."
"That would mean cuts in public investment, in education and training, in social and in health services."
"Consolidation cannot be achieved through tax rises alone."
"Europe's growth potential would suffer even more than it already has and, as a result, the recovery would be extremely slow and a large share of the current unemployed would become long-term unemployed."
"Europeans deserve a more balanced and socially responsible policy approach."
"We believe this approach should involve an 'entry strategy' into the labour market, which should form an integral part of the 2020 strategy and constitute its roadmap for the years up to 2015."
"It should combine the macro-economic policy agenda with structural policies in the economic, social and environmental fields to aim at the creation of at least five million net new jobs by 2015, particularly in the green economy."
"The European Council should state this intention clearly at the March summit as a key objective of the new strategy."
"Proper economic policy coordination reaching well beyond the policing role of the stability pact should ensure that gradual fiscal consolidation in the different Member States is combined with the preservation of key public spending in growth areas and key social policies."
"This will demand a political leap in thinking with regard to Europe's - and, in particular, the eurozone's - economic governance."
"The March or June summit should give a mandate to its president, in close cooperation with the Commission, to submit an ambitious plan for the strengthening of economic governance in the EU for decision by the December 2010 Council."
"We need to challenge the old way of doing things if we want to learn lessons from the current crisis and make it history as soon as possible."
"This is a chance to make Europe relevant to people and not just to markets."
"This can only become a reality if the 2020 strategy is indeed about people and about jobs - in other words, if it incorporates an ambitious social and decent-jobs agenda."
"In the name of my group, I urge you to do all you can to put people, and not least, the most vulnerable people, at the heart of the European project."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all, let me come directly to what I would call the most urgent problem today."
"We can talk about 2020, but we have a more urgent problem today: the eurozone and Greece."
"We have to find solutions to that."
"I think we, the European Parliament, have to take the initiative in this field."
"It is important to determine what exactly happened in Greece."
"Today, we received contradictory information."
"Greece says that it has given all the information to the European Union and European institutions."
"At the same time, the European Commission and Eurostat are saying that they did not receive all the necessary information."
"At the same time the investment banks - Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank - are minimising what they have done in the Greece case."
"I therefore think it is the task of this Parliament to organise hearings with the relevant committee as quickly as possible, so that we can hear all the parties concerned on this matter and find out exactly what is happening in the case of Greece."
"We cannot talk about remedies, about solutions, about reforms in the European Union if, first of all, we do not know what really happened in the case of Greece in 2008 and 2009 and before that, and I think it is absolutely necessary that the different parties are heard by this Parliament."
"The second point is that we also have to tackle the problem of the Greek debt."
"I think there is only one good solution to that."
"Yesterday, I read the article by George Soros in the Financial Times on the matter, and a few days ago I read the article by Joschka Fischer in the German press."
"He is saying what many people are saying: the best solution to the Greek debt is a European solution - euro obligations, or a European monetary fund, without any costs to the European taxpayer, but with a solution for the future."
"I think it is also the task of this Parliament to ask the Commission and the Council to reflect on that possibility and to go beyond the national interests of the current Member States of the European Union to examine this possibility."
"Thirdly, I think the most important part of this debate is, naturally, what to do about 2020."
"I think Greece is a very good example of what went wrong with the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Lisbon Strategy was too weak; the gap between the German economy and the Greek economy widened over the last 10 years: it became bigger, not smaller, after the Lisbon Strategy."
"What we need - and it is the first decision to be taken by the Commission and the European Council - is to recognise that the open coordination method was not a good method; it was too weak a method."
"We need a bolder instrument inside the European Union."
"This bolder instrument is economic governance inside the European Union."
"Mr Barroso, I hope that in a few days' time, at the beginning of March - I think it is 3 March - you come forward with a paper on this."
"I hope it will include a bolder strategy than the things that were concluded or not concluded at the informal summit."
"It is still an intergovernmental, open-coordination method."
"They make it a little bit better, a little bit faster, but at the end, it continues to be an open coordination method based on intergovernmentalism."
"What we ask from you is to take the lead on that, on this economic policy and on this economic governance, and to come forward, together with Olli Rehn, with a bold proposal to have economic governance inside the European Union."
"It is nonsense to have monetary union on the one hand and not to have an economic and social and political union on the other."
"The problems with Greece are proof of that."
"(Applause)"
"I think this is a time when we can expect something bold from the Commission, and I hope that on 3 March, the Commission will propose a document that is far more ambitious than the - in my view - disappointing conclusions of the informal summit."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr President, I would like to ask Mr Verhofstadt this question: are you advocating that countries which are not in the eurozone should bail out countries which are in the eurozone?"
"Is that what you are advocating?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Maybe it will be necessary in the near future to bale out Britain, because I have seen that the fiscal deficit of Britain is even higher than the fiscal deficit of Greece."
"(Applause)"
"The fiscal deficit is, if I am not mistaken, 12.9% of GDP for the moment."
"So I think what is most important for the moment is that we have a credible strategy towards the eurozone, and I am very sure - maybe not tomorrow but the day after tomorrow - there will come a time when Britain is a member of the eurozone."
"Be sure."
"Mr President, I hope that the British kindergarten will be kind enough to listen for a moment."
"(Heckling)"
"I had intended to start my speech with the EU 2020 strategy, but now I am going to begin by talking about Greece, particularly in light of the intervention from the right of this House."
"I believe that what is least helpful in the dispute over the situation in, and the prospects for, Greece is an anti-Greek, nationalistic or anti-European attitude."
"In my opinion, mistakes that have been made for a long time are now being revealed in Greece - often, more comes to light in a crisis than in good times."
"I would like to pick up on an issue raised by Mr Verhofstadt."
"If we do not want anti-European developments, we need to discuss who in Brussels is responsible for allowing these things to be concealed in Greece for so many years - probably even during the entire preparatory period for the monetary union."
"Mr Barroso, I believe that you have a crucial share of the responsibility in this regard."
"This, in particular, is something that you need to disclose, because as yet, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of responsibility and we have not seen the system of irresponsibility that lies beneath it."
"Secondly, a lot needs to change in Greece, too."
"We need to have a - preferably friendly - discussion with Greece about this within the euro area."
"If this help is necessary - which I think it will be - and if European solidarity needs to be employed once again - and I would not want to rule it out in any way at this point - then Greece needs to make some real changes."
"There is the excessive public sector, for example."
"If I am to believe the Greeks with whom I have spoken, 25% of Greek workers are employed in the public sector, and it is not even a good public sector."
"It is definitely in need of reform."
"However, it is not only in terms of expenditure that changes need to be made, as there is clearly something very wrong with the revenue side as well."
"I think that Mr Papandreou has the right idea with his intention to publish the tax declarations of the high earners in Greece."
"It is not necessary to buy CDs from Switzerland; there is another way to go about this."
"This will very quickly shed light on the fact that, in Greece too, the revenue can be considerably improved if tax evasion is ultimately prevented and the people in Greece who are living in the lap of luxury pay their taxes like decent citizens."
"My colleague, Mr Giegold, will probably talk more about the Eurobonds later."
"I would just like to say one sentence about the EU 2020 strategy."
"Mr Barroso, you made absolutely no mention of the failures of the Lisbon Strategy."
"I believe that the failure to evaluate the Lisbon Strategy does not bode at all well for the success or possible success of the new strategy."
"As an integrated strategy, it is, in principle, not bad, but ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Verhofstadt for reminding us all of the failure of left-wing economic policies in the United Kingdom."
"We are very grateful for the advice and I hope my colleagues and I will be able to remedy that in the forthcoming general election."
"Even before the recent crisis, the economies of Europe were losing ground to our major rivals and competitors."
"Our growth level was less, our unemployment higher, our relative trading position was in decline and our share of global output falling."
"We had launched the Lisbon Strategy, but without enough conviction or commitment; unsurprisingly, it has not succeeded."
"Europe 2020 must not go the same way."
"I am very pleased that my group was among the first to submit proposals to help with its progress."
"We now need to set a new course for our economies."
"We must recognise that governments do not create productive jobs or raise living standards."
"Only competitive business and successful entrepreneurs can do that."
"Our Member States and the institutions of the European Union then need to support them by reducing the burdens they face."
"We cannot expect to have dynamic economies if we make even greater demands on those who are generating growth and jobs by imposing heavy tax regimes and bureaucratic regulations."
"We need to encourage more research and development, improved higher education and better vocational training, as President Barroso has just emphasised."
"The internal market needs to be reinvigorated and extended to new fields."
"The stakes could not be higher."
"For almost three centuries, the strongest economic powers in the world have also been those with the most liberal and the most democratic constitutions; the cause of freedom and economic prosperity have marched together."
"We are now entering a new era."
"By the end of this century, considerable economic power may have shifted to states with undemocratic governments."
"That authoritarian capitalism may not evolve gently into the democratic and responsible capitalism we enjoy today in Europe and the West."
"We hope those states will liberalise."
"We will offer them friendly encouragement to do so, but we know the risks."
"It is in the interests of our citizens that the 2020 programme succeeds in stimulating the creation of good jobs and rising living standards, and it is in the interests of the free world that the 2020 programme points the way to a stronger economic future for all our citizens."
"Mr President, in times of need, you discover who your friends are, as the saying goes."
"There are 27 governments in the European Union trying - each in its own way - to rescue their own banks and large-scale industries."
"This has so far resulted in more debt for each individual country and catastrophic savings rates for citizens."
"The euphemistic wage restraint policy, reducing non-wage labour costs and the privatisation of life risks such as age, family, sickness and desired education have all been mentioned."
"The banks are now using the state rescue packages to speculate against the national budgets."
"The banks have already made more progress than the states."
"Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank, which, in Germany, were rescued using billions of euros of taxpayers' money, are right at the forefront when it comes to the business of excessively expensive government bonds in Greece."
"Taxpayers' money is being used for speculation and this is money from normal, honest wage earners who do not have Swiss bank accounts like those to which the richer people are fleeing."
"(Heckling)"
"Believe me, I find no pleasure in using negative examples from Germany."
"However, one governing party in Germany is constantly calling for tax relief, while at the same time, the Greek Government is being called on to increase taxes."
"Who will have to find this money, though?"
"I fear that it will primarily be those who are already finding it hard to make ends meet."
"Was it not Germany, formerly the world's highest exporter, that years ago separated wage increases from productivity, thus resulting in social dumping?"
"In ancient Greek theatre, a crisis means an opportunity - yes, the challenge of a turning point."
"In order to bring about such a turning point, we must demand that a statutory minimum wage finally be put in place."
"The same work in the same place must receive the same wage."
"We need harmonisation of tax types within the Union, but above all, we need genuine European regulation and control of the financial markets and a real European economic and finance policy, coordinated on the basis of solidarity, with binding social and environmental targets."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - President of Europe - this long-awaited day."
"We were told that, when we had a President, we would see a giant global political figure: the man that would be the political leader for five hundred million people; the man that would represent all of us on the world stage; the man whose job was so important that of course, you are paid more than President Obama."
"Well, I am afraid what we got was you."
"And I am sorry, but after that performance that you gave earlier..."
"I do not want to be rude, but you know, really, you have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk."
"(Protests)"
"The question that I want to ask and that we are all going to ask is: who are you?"
"I had never heard of you; nobody in Europe had ever heard of you."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President: who voted for you?"
"(Loud protests)"
"And what mechanism - I know democracy is not popular with you lot - what mechanism do the peoples of Europe have to remove you?"
"Is this European democracy?"
"I sense, though, that you are competent and capable and dangerous, and I have no doubt that it is your intention to be the quiet assassin of European democracy and of the European nation states."
"You appear to have a loathing for the very concept of the existence of nation states; perhaps that is because you come from Belgium, which, of course, is pretty much a non-country."
"(Reactions)"
"But since you took over, we have seen Greece reduced to nothing more than a protectorate."
"Sir, you have no legitimacy in this job at all, and I can say with confidence that I can speak on behalf of the majority of the British people in saying: we do not know you, we do not want you, and the sooner you are put out to grass, the better."
"As you said, Mr Chair, you would not like to be rude."
"I prefer to go ahead."
"Mr Chair, will you take a blue card question?"
"Mr Farage, are you willing to apply Article 9 of the treaty to ask to simply leave Europe?"
"That way, you will be happy."
"Mr President, I am very disappointed in you, Mr Buzek."
"It is unacceptable for a group chair to call the President of the European Council a 'damp rag' in this Parliament, rather than offering political criticism."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I would expect you to respond to that with a call to order."
"It is not acceptable for this man to freely trample the dignity of this House underfoot."
"To Mr Daul, I would like to say that it is not a question of the United Kingdom leaving the EU."
"It would perhaps be better for Mr Farage to relinquish his mandate if he finds the European Union and the European Parliament so objectionable."
"(Applause)"
"What I said to Mr Farage two months ago I say, again, today: speeches of this kind, which make personal attacks on particular people, are not acceptable in the European Parliament."
"When I spoke with Mr Farage about this, I pointed this out to him."
"I would like to say, Mr Schulz, that I have done and am doing just as you suggest."
"You may not like what I say, but just consider your behaviour."
"After the Irish people voted 'no' in a referendum, you said that, by supporting the 'no' vote, our group had opened the door to fascism; you said that we had behaved as a group in the Parliament like Hitler and the Nazis in the Reichstag."
"We have been called mentally weak by Danny Cohn-Bendit."
"You know, it has to be..."
"It cannot be one way ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Farage, I am sorry but it was not a personal statement."
"We must keep order and all the regulations of our Parliament."
"(NL) First of all, allow me to state calmly the fact that we are conducting this debate in this Chamber, in Brussels, in Belgium."
"In the current economic context, we could describe the country of Belgium as the Greece of the North Sea without any exaggeration whatsoever because this country, Belgium, has, after Greece and Italy, the largest government debt in percentage terms in the whole of Europe."
"Fundamentally, we are a sick country in Europe and, if I can put it this way, that is in no way a credit to one of the previous speakers, Mr Verhofstadt, former Prime Minister of Belgium."
"When it comes to fraud and artificially inflating the budget, he could even teach the Greeks a thing or two!"
"However, let us not get too worked up about that."
"In particular, let us not claim that we will be able to avert the crisis by running up a higher government debt, the infamous Verhofstadt proposal for a European government loan, which is a bill that somebody will have to foot sooner or later."
"On the contrary, we have seen, time and again, that it is European decisions that have led us into the crisis, European decisions to throw the Maastricht criteria and the Stability and Growth Pact out of the window all for the sake of appearances, because Europe had to be seen to move forward."
"It is also that same Eurocrat obstinacy which is now ramming Turkey's accession strategy down our throats."
"The economic and geographical reality must now be pushed to one side and European citizens have to pay through the nose for the potential accession of a country which is not even European."
"The solution is not 'more Europe'."
"The solution is national responsibility and the obligation of individual Member States to cut their coats according to their cloth."
"(NL) President Buzek, President Barroso and, of course, also President Van Rompuy, we are delighted to have you here with us today."
"Your comments at the beginning of the debate made it clear that you wish to set to work ambitiously, but also that you wish to perform your role as intended in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I should like to congratulate you on this in advance."
"It is important that you are here in connection with the forthcoming 2020 strategy, because it is crucial for re-establishing Europe's role in the world."
"Mr President, and here I address President Barroso as well, you know what our priorities are."
"They centre on a green, social, market economy."
"This means that our foremost task should be to get small and medium-sized enterprises, as the powerhouse behind our job creation, back on their feet again."
"We are not talking about just our trade and services here, but also about our European industry, which we have to make competitive again on the world stage."
"We are also talking about our agricultural sector and high-quality food production, which are also competitive on the world stage."
"That means that we need SMEs with knowledge, innovation and sustainable technology at their core."
"The 2020 strategy must be built on such a foundation."
"Such a foundation means an exit strategy that will go hand in hand with a strong stability and growth pact and with the necessary reform of Member State governments' spending."
"Mr President, the old Lisbon Strategy contained too many vague objectives and demonstrated the failure of the open coordination method."
"Therefore, my question to you is: what specific objectives are you going to bring in to force the Member States, ultimately, to show real commitment to this new strategy, while remaining within the limits of the Treaty of Lisbon when it comes to subsidiarity?"
"(SV) Mr President, according to the Commission's own figures, 80 million EU citizens are currently living below the poverty line."
"That is indecent and it is also an obstacle to all other development."
"At the same time, a man like Mr Farage stands here in Parliament and lets fly with insults at a time when Europe is in crisis and we have a great many important matters to debate."
"He should be given a time-out and should not be permitted to attend next week's session in Strasbourg."
"It would be a mild punishment for the behaviour he has exhibited."
"Our task now is to produce a new Lisbon Strategy, in other words, EU 2020."
"In this context, it is important to realise that social cohesion and sustainable development are essential for economic growth."
"The first society to get away from our dependence on fossil fuels, for example, will take the lead in the creation of new green jobs."
"However, we need resources if this is to succeed."
"At least 50% of the funding set aside by the EU and the Member States to get us out of the crisis needs to be invested in a new Green Deal capable of creating these new green jobs."
"The Seventh and Eighth Framework Programmes must concentrate on research and development relating to renewable energy."
"The Commission must also make vigorous efforts to prevent the social exclusion that is currently taking place around Europe and to strengthen the parties of the labour market."
"In recent years, the EU has rightly begun to be seen as a threat to the trade union movement."
"This needs to change."
"A first step would be to revise the controversial Posting of Workers Directive or, as it has come to be known in Europe, the 'Wage Dumping Directive', which is generating so much anger and so much conflict."
"We have had enough of that here today in Parliament."
"Mr President, the aim of EU 2020 should be to free the potential of the European citizen."
"All too often we forget that our strategies for growth are put in place for the benefit of our citizens and the future of our children."
"There is no doubt that the Lisbon Strategy failed when it attempted to include everything."
"With such a broad agenda, the focus was lost and so were the possibilities to achieve the ambitious goals that were set."
"For the 2020 strategy to be more effective, the format needs to be changed into something completely different."
"The work should be targeted at the few specific areas where the fundamentals of sustainable growth should be addressed."
"As the only directly elected body of the EU, and with full codecision powers in place, this Parliament will have its say in the 2020 strategy."
"In order to ensure legitimacy and openness, the Commission and the Council will therefore be wise to include Parliament in the ongoing work of the 2020 strategy."
"Just as openness and transparency are essential for the creation of a citizen's Europe, they are also key instruments in avoiding crises in public finances such as those currently hitting countries across the Union."
"Everyone is pointing their fingers at Greece but there are also other Member States that have avoided benchmarking, deceived Europe about their deficits and cheated with their financial statistics."
"The method of open coordination has turned into a closed collusion and open humiliation."
"Remember, what is true for citizens is also true for governments."
"Freedoms also bring responsibilities."
"It is now time for governments across Europe to take that responsibility seriously because the problems we face are serious."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the idea of reducing the number of goals in the EU 2020 strategy to a limited number, provided that they are at least ambitious."
"Ambitious, firstly, as regards the reduction of our ecological footprint."
"Therefore, this is not just about the climate and, from that point of view, returning to the 20% figure is, in our view, far below what is really required."
"Not even 30% is ambitious."
"Next, an ambitious goal concerning the reduction in inequalities: for example, reducing the level of poverty in Europe by 50% by 2020; that certainly would not be a maximum to achieve."
"An ambitious goal with regard to education, research, development and innovation, and, of course, an ambitious goal with regard to job creation."
"These goals, as has already been mentioned, must be measurable and must be binding; whether it is a bonus-malus system or something else matters little, but we need results."
"However, we will not achieve these results without two absolutely vital ingredients."
"The first ingredient is strong market regulations and, from that point of view, Mr Van Rompuy, the developments with regard to financial market supervision and the positions adopted by the Council worry us greatly."
"As regards the second ingredient, I would like to stress what Mr Daul said."
"Indeed, Mr Daul, Member States will have to abandon more of their sovereignty, in particular in the fiscal area."
"I wonder where the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) stands on that."
"Without strong fiscal convergence, we will be unable to bring stability back to our public finances and build our tax system on a sustainable basis."
"We are thinking of energy, we are thinking, of course, of taxation on financial transactions."
"Mr President, I support the direction of the EU 2020 strategy, particularly at this time of economic crisis, and would urge that the EU focus on Europe's existing comparative economic and competitive advantages and use all tools and resources available, particularly in the area of R&D, to create real EU added value."
"I would seek for us to prioritise the completion of the single market for services and goods and to take an ambitious approach in creating a single market for innovative research."
"There should be wide encouragement of research and development both in universities and in private enterprises in Europe so that we can be at the forefront of new sustainable industry and technologies."
"We must, however, remain vigilant against legislation that serves to hinder these developmental processes."
"We need to improve the link between private sector and academic research and work to facilitate the transfer of knowledge into job- and wealth-creating enterprises."
"As well as improving the availability of finance for innovation, we need to ensure a reduced administrative burden, particularly for SMEs and micro-entities."
"Following SME-friendly procurement policies and allowing SMEs to participate in public/private partnerships will be a start."
"An EU 2020 strategy focused on innovation in areas of existing expertise..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(EL) Mr President, huge unemployment rallies are being held in Greece today by workers in the private and public sectors."
"Anger has spilled on to the streets and the workers are indignant in the face of the harsh measures being taken by the Greek Government at the insistence of the European Union, especially the recent European Council at which, instead of taking measures for the benefit of the weak economies, instead of taking measures to put an end to speculation and create an umbrella of economic and social solidarity, instead of accepting that the Stability Pact does not exist and that bringing it back will deepen the recession and instead of accepting that the Treaty of Lisbon has failed resoundingly, the Council is preparing the 2020 European Commission as an expansion and continuation of the treaty."
"You are treating Greece as a scapegoat, dictating measures against the workers, who are not to blame for the crisis, that will usher in similar measures for other countries."
"The people of Greece and the people of Europe will shortly deal with you as the people of Argentina dealt with the International Monetary Fund."
"(LT) It is symbolic that 20 years after the fall of the wall that divided Europe, today we are talking about Europe 2020."
"Firstly, I would like to approve the fundamental priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy: knowledge and innovation, a society of high employment and a competitive and sustainable economy."
"I propose that we add two more priorities - infrastructure development and an effective energy policy."
"While stressing the strengthening of energy security as one of the most important priorities of European energy policy and aiming to ensure the diversification of sources of energy and supply routes, we must not forget the important Rail Baltica and Via Baltica projects which are important not only to Lithuania."
"I believe that while preparing a new strategy, we must assess the reasons we failed to achieve the goals outlined in the Lisbon Strategy."
"We must not only set out new strategy goals and tasks, but turn discussions that sometimes last too long into concrete action with precise deadlines."
"(ES) Madam President, I believe that this crisis is an opportunity to move forward firmly and with conviction in creating a strong Europe."
"In this strong Europe, we will probably have to dispense with the expression 'improving coordination', as it means that everything is dependent on the subjects that have to be coordinated and inevitably leads to paralysis and a lack of clarity."
"We know that the finances and the public deficits of European countries will suffer until we move towards European financial integration and Eurobonds are issued."
"In any case, the European institutions can already take specific action - I will not focus on all the hot air about coordination."
"On the one hand, we have the European Central Bank for harmonising financial supervision and on ..."
"(Remainder of speech not available for technical reasons)"
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, if the 2020 strategy is to succeed it must - unlike the Lisbon Strategy - actually be implemented."
"In contrast to what previous speakers have said, the goals were not wrong."
"The main reason for the failure of the strategy was the fact that the Member States did not stick to the rules and fulfil their obligations."
"Moreover, the Commission was not courageous enough, Mr Barroso."
"It was not courageous enough in connection with the implementation, in demanding reforms or in executing its own strategy."
"With a broad majority, you have a new Commission for your second period of office - I hope that you will improve everything, that you will re-inject dynamism into Europe, that you will promote technology and that we will not only talk about redistribution but that we will compete with the other economic regions of the world."
"These regions do not ask whether Europeans agree amongst themselves or whether they are implementing new redistribution programmes."
"They have their own dynamism, and we need to respond to this."
"That is the task that this strategy must allow us to fulfil."
"As yet, only drafts have been tabled and I hope that they will be improved upon, because these drafts seem very much to have a 'carry on as before' mentality."
"There are no really new approaches."
"There is not even anything really new from the Council and the new President of the European Council."
"However, we need this strategy in order to be able to keep up with the rest of the world."
"For this, new framework conditions need to be defined."
"We need to think carefully about the climate objectives of the past."
"We need to promote technology and not continue to put obstacles in its way."
"As a collegial body, the Commission is called on not to represent the interests of individual commissioners, but to take a leading role in Europe."
"You can be certain of our unreserved support."
"Only then will the 2020 strategy succeed - not with the cowardliness of the governments and the insistence that someone pay for what the relevant partner in Europe does not deal with themselves."
"(FR) Madam President, President Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, I would like first of all to say that, as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned, everyone agrees on the targets."
"However, the problem our continent has today is that it is emerging from a serious crisis, the characteristics of that being that we have extremely weak, or even negative, growth globally."
"This therefore requires political awareness and, for me, that has two goals."
"Firstly, that of knowing how we organise ourselves politically."
"In the positions you hold, you have two major responsibilities: to encourage coordination of economic policies - this is absolutely vital - and to set targets with tools to achieve them."
"This brings me on to the second goal, which I believe is essential, and, at the same time, it will be a question."
"To achieve goals in public policy, a budget is needed."
"Today, Europe is confronted with this dilemma: the Member States have significant deficits and the more significant their deficits, the less they will throw in Europe's common pot."
"Therefore, we are less able to revive our growth."
"How do we solve this dilemma?"
"This is the question I put to you."
"It depends on two elements."
"Firstly, what are the guidelines that you will defend when discussing the budgetary perspectives with the Member States?"
"Secondly, are you able to move towards innovations that will allow the European Investment Bank and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development alike to assume much greater responsibility and - why not? - to enable Europe to borrow to finance this necessity, which is the growth of tomorrow?"
"(FR) Presidents, after the Lisbon Strategy, we now have the 2020 strategy."
"Is it a simple name change or a change of direction?"
"I address this in particular to Mr Barroso."
"While reading your contribution to the informal Council, while hearing you talk today quite rightly of the number of poor in the European Union and of the need to develop financial regulation, I said to myself, Mr Barroso, that it is a pity that you were not a proper President of the Commission over the last few years!"
"Then you would have been able to do everything that you are proposing to us today."
"Today, you say that it is the crisis that prevented you from doing it, but it is easy to blame the crisis."
"In the end, every sin can be forgiven, so let us not waste any more time."
"I turn therefore with hope to Mr Van Rompuy, firstly to offer him a warmer welcome than the one he was offered previously by one of the other Members - not by the others."
"It is you we are counting on."
"It is slightly paradoxical, Mr Van Rompuy, but we are counting on you to relaunch Europe, a proper European community, and you come from a country which knows what the word 'community' means in terms of the general interest."
"If you tackle this, you will have the support of this Parliament, and I believe that, as far as the 2020 strategy is concerned, we must not let ourselves be misled by words."
"If words mean anything, we must, above all, think medium term, think global and think beyond nationalism."
"I agree with what Mr Lamberts said: right now, the Members of the Council are not giving us a great European perspective on financial supervision."
"They have both feet on the brakes."
"For my part, I therefore propose a single goal, which you actually mention in your own paper for the Council, and that is to have an Economic and Monetary Union in all its forms, to consolidate disciplines and, of course, to consolidate solidarity."
"It is also to remind the Council that, while there are problems in Greece, they are partly down to the Greeks and partly down to a lack of solidarity."
"(DE) Madam President, it is easy to set fine goals."
"We all do this at the beginning of every year, we set fine goals, but whether they remain a dream, a sermon or whether they become an agenda depends on whether we provide specific answers to the questions of who, what, how, how much and when."
"That is what we need to see for the Europe 2020 agenda."
"In my opinion, Mr Daul hit the nail on the head at the beginning of this debate."
"The question is, are we prepared to renounce national sovereignty in the area of economic policy, or would we rather do without the cohesion of the Union, or without the euro, or without what we have spent decades building up?"
"The alternative is that dramatic."
"I would also have liked to have heard some clear statements from the representative of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), because, as we know, it is the Conservatives in Germany who have so often stood in the way of this."
"Madam President, Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, I would like not only to hear the President of the European Council say, with quiet assurance, that the Council wants to lay down guidelines in this area, but I would also like to see the Commission, together with Parliament, taking on the task of actively and with energy working to produce these guidelines for common European economic governance."
"In so doing, it should not merely be led by the hand of Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy, but should make a sincere effort to bring Europe together under a common economic policy."
"(EL) Madam President, as you are well aware, while we are debating the results of the informal European Council, the entire Greek workforce, down to the last man, is on strike in protest against precisely these measures, against precisely these results."
"They are protesting about the European Union itself and the policy of the centre-left and centre-right governments unanimously taking anti-grassroots, anti-labour measures purely and simply in order to safeguard the profits of the monopolies."
"The European Union, governments and the Commission are trying to terrorise workers throughout the European Union in a bid to make them bow down before the storm of the anti-grassroots measures."
"However, in this war, the workers are responding with mass strikes, demonstrations and rallies, about which I have heard you say nothing, Mr Barroso, with demonstrations and strikes being organised by the class-conscious trade unions in numerous countries of the European Union."
"There is only one answer which the workers can give to the front being put up by the parties of capital, to the European one-way street, to the compromised trade union leaders, to the widespread attack by the government on wages and pensions: a development in their interests."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there has been a formal show of solidarity with Greece, but in reality, the aim was simply to impose a rigid austerity policy on the Member States of the European Union."
"At the closing press conference, Mr Van Rompuy clearly stated that the idea is to establish a kind of dictatorship of the European Union, turning the Council into an imperial junta, with ever greater powers over the Member States."
"Before the summit - the Independent revealed - he sent a letter to the Heads of State or Government in which he wrote, in one of the enclosures, that the Members of the Council were responsible for economic strategy within their governments and that they should be responsible for it at EU level too."
"Whether one calls it policy coordination or economic governance, only the Council is able to formulate and uphold a European strategy."
"He also added that the European Council is very ambitious, that it wants control and wants to act as a leader, albeit, of course, within the scope of consultation, and that that was why he had proposed that the Council meet each month."
"These are imperial designs of the architects of the European Union, and they also feature in a project that is circulating in the corridors of the Commission, which calls for 80% of the EU Member States' debt to become European Union debt."
"The campaign for an economic superstate launched in recent days is liable to turn not only Greece but all the 27 Member States of the European Union into protectorates."
"(DE) Madam President, the EU has now adopted a post-Lisbon Strategy in which it has been careful not to commit itself to any testable goals at all."
"Focusing on the green economy will not, in itself, be enough to guarantee the competitiveness of Europe as a centre of production."
"In my opinion, in addition to a well-functioning energy supply and infrastructure, this will require well-trained workers and not wave after wave of migrant workers flooding the labour market with cheap labour."
"If it is necessary to make the national labour markets more flexible, then it must not lead to the transitional periods for the new Member States being lifted by the back door."
"A time of crisis, in which more and more people are becoming unemployed or having to eke out a living from part-time work or 'one-euro jobs', is not the time for the EU to give new impetus to the existing merciless competition on the labour market."
"The European Union should not, as a general rule, employ despotism."
"It must not immediately withdraw financial aid from structurally weak regions because no reforms have been carried out - not even as a threat."
"We certainly do not need a new advisory committee to evaluate the goals, which will probably end up on the shelf once again."
"Instead of more centralism, we need to move the subsidies back to national level."
"Europe 2020 must not trigger another competition marathon and privatisation exodus."
"Instead, it must guarantee the prosperity of the citizens of Europe."
"The EU has a chance now to gain status as a bulwark against globalisation and this will probably be its only chance."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, President of the Council, you may not be well known, as Mr Farage maintains, but I know that your ideals are deeply rooted in European tradition and culture, and for that I admire and respect you."
"Precisely for that reason, may I take the liberty of commenting on your very rational speech by drawing an analogy from the world of football."
"The vision that you have of your role seems to me to be similar to that of a halfback, of a midfielder who has the job of bringing order to the game for a team which, after the rule changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, may find it harder to score goals, that is, to achieve its objectives."
"In the light of this example, I believe that it is up to Parliament to risk more than the other players, to be a striker who continually reinvents the game, taking inspiration from the new rules so as to strengthen the team's attacking ability and to put our hypothetical centre forward - the Barroso Commission - in a position to score."
"What will happen if we do not follow this approach, which I wholeheartedly support?"
"We will withdraw into a defensive position and we will score an own goal against the interests of our fellow citizens."
"Precisely for this reason, Mr Van Rompuy, I ask you to support the new leading role played by Parliament and to see it not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity."
"We are all required to rise to this historic occasion, to perform a historic role, a historic task, and I am certain that you are the right man to lead us."
"(ES) (Beginning of speech not available for technical reasons) ..."
"If we are talking about the 2020 strategy, we are not only talking about the post-Lisbon strategy, but also about the strategy of recognising the failure to fulfil Lisbon, or to put it more harshly and crudely, the strategy of recognising the failure of Lisbon."
"It is a strategy that was designed to ensure growth and sustainability, but it has not been fulfilled, because it has not succeeded in ensuring sustainability, from a financial, environmental or social point of view."
"From a financial point of view, Europe has constructed the Monetary Union, but it is very far not only from constructing the Economic Union, but even from coordinating economic policy and the fiscal stimuli that should accompany the Monetary Union."
"From an energy point of view, a single European policy is still yet to be invented."
"From a social point of view, all over Europe, there is discontent among workers, unions and the most disadvantaged classes, who are concerned about the sustainability of the model that made us better when it made us Europeans, the very model that has succeeding in ensuring welfare and social cohesion."
"In view of the informal Council meeting that was held on 11 February, I would like to ask what commitment the Council, the Commission and all the European institutions want to make in order to strengthen the commitment to the social pact that was mentioned in the speech by the rotating President of the Union for the next six months, the Spanish Prime Minister, JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero?"
"A social pact that is able to clearly state that this time, Europe is going to make a commitment to financial and environmental sustainability, and also to preserving the social model that made us better when it made us Europeans."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso talked earlier on about wanting an ambitious strategy, and it is true that there are parts of the document EU 2020 which are ambitious, but certainly the greenhouse gas emission figure is not ambitious: it is pathetic, and it is not going to get us where we want to go."
"We should be looking at 40% by 2020. Of course, the issue is not only about climate but also about resource availability and increasing resource efficiency."
"There is a lot, as well, that we seem to have seen before in this strategy, not least about economic growth coming through more and more as a goal rather than an indicator."
"It should not be the goal of a strategy."
"The EU has many areas where we have tried to decouple growth from transport, energy use, whatever, and it has long been decoupled from jobs."
"So, can we please not talk as if, somehow, growth is going to deliver jobs?"
"We also need to be looking not just at reducing poverty but reducing inequalities, because that has known demonstrable benefits, and we need to make sure that our financial institutions do not undermine the ambitious goals that we might put in place."
"(DE) Mr van Rompuy, first of all, I would like to thank you for the letter that you sent us."
"I can tell you that I fully support the principles, values and the direction to take that you set out in the letter."
"I am pleased that you said today that you want to meet almost on a monthly basis, because it is your job to bring the Heads of State or Government and the Member States back to Europe."
"The Lisbon Strategy itself was not wrong, but the methods were wrong and the political will was lacking for the objectives to be implemented in the Member States."
"It must be your job to coordinate the Member States in areas where the powers of the European Commission and the Union are inadequate."
"You said very clearly that the market is not enough."
"Yes indeed, we want a social market economy."
"The monetary union is not enough."
"We need political union."
"The first test for all of us will be the 2011 budget, which will already have to be based on the Europe 2020 strategy."
"Europe 2020 is not the goal; it is the instrument with which we will do what we need to do in response to the financial and economic crisis."
"We need more coordination in budgetary policy, fiscal policy, economic policy, research policy and education policy, because we cannot improve our competitiveness with economic goals alone."
"We therefore need the Small Business Act to be implemented in the Member States."
"Our motto should be 'small businesses first', because that will create jobs in the regions."
"There are three things I would like to see."
"Mr Barroso, we need a study of the effects of all of the Commission's measures on the real economy, not just on the banking sector."
"We need a review of our finances which also takes account of demographic changes and the social security and pension systems."
"We also need a joint package that includes coordination, the excessive deficit procedure, the exit strategy and Europe 2020, so that these do not contradict each other."
"(ES) President Van Rompuy, President Barroso, I really like the sound of what I have heard today."
"I hope that the lyrics will be the same next week, because as we have all understood - as have you - that would mean that we can and must set ourselves objectives, and that we can choose our future."
"It would mean that there is no economic determinism, that there is a voice for politics, a voice for citizens, a voice for our future in our own hands."
"It would mean the economy sets limits for us and provides us with the means, but that the objectives are set by us, and that the economy should be serving society rather than the other way around."
"It would mean that, as has been said here this afternoon, we need a long-term strategy, not just a short-term strategy, because I believe that is the lesson we can learn from the past."
"The lesson we can learn from the past is that we have experienced considerable economic growth, but on the basis of speculation, which has not taken into account justice, fairness, the environment, the future or future generations."
"I therefore really hope, President-in-Office of the Council, that next week, we will have documents that contain an ambitious agenda, an agenda that points to sustainability, an agenda that makes economic, social and environmental concerns compatible, because they are interdependent."
"I would now like to say a few words about the social dimension of the agenda: that is where the demands, dreams and fears of citizens are manifested, the dreams and fears of those that are within and outside the labour market, of the victims of the arrogance of the financial markets, which has taken control of the real economy and destroyed it."
"That is where the hopes lie that we will put an end to this, that we will make a policy for full employment, for quality jobs, for jobs that are inclusive for all, and that we will finally make Europe's objective excellence rather than the fight to lower social standards."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Barroso, Mr Van Rompuy, the crisis in the European economy is so deep that we have to expect very specific proposals in this situation -. specific proposals along the lines of those put forward here by various speakers."
"European economic governance has been called for in many different ways by Parliament."
"Provide a proposal for how the risks relating to the high levels of debt can be distributed so that Greece and other countries are not crushed by high interest rates."
"Provide a proposal - as called for by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs yesterday - for how we can tackle the imbalances."
"It is not only the countries with the deficits that need to be penalised and to make changes."
"Reforms also need to be made in the countries that have excessive surpluses."
"We need European statistics that are independent and we need to take effective measures to prevent tax competition."
"Such proposals have been put forward in Parliament."
"It is now up to you to finally put these things on the table."
"(FR) Mr Van Rompuy, Minister, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, finally, you are with us, President of the European Council, welcome!"
"However, I will begin by reiterating my great disappointment that your first political move was not to come and present yourself to the representatives of the peoples of Europe following 1 December, the date you officially took office."
"Like us, Mr Van Rompuy, you are a politician, and politics cannot exist without democracy."
"The democratic lesson of the French and Dutch referendums of 2005 and of many other peoples, had they been consulted, is that citizens are saying they are not against Europe, but they have the feeling that it is being built without them, and sometimes against them."
"It is therefore thanks to Mrs Merkel, who was in your seat in 2007, and to Mr Sarkozy, who had just been elected President of the Republic of France, that citizens were once again placed at the heart of European integration with the Treaty of Lisbon, which created the high office that you hold."
"Mr Van Rompuy, you must understand that nothing can be done without the citizens and their representatives, just as our Parliament must understand that nothing can be done without the Member States and hence, the Heads of State or Government."
"Let us get to the point: the peoples of Europe are suffering because they no longer understand the huge global disruption going on around them."
"Your duty is to give meaning to it, to set the course, to convince the European Council that Europe is not a problem, but a solution."
"Europe does not expose, it protects."
"Europe does not suffer, it acts."
"What is your vision of the world and of the European Union's place in it?"
"Could you tell us what part intergovernmentalism plays in your European strategy, in particular, with regard to the economic governance that we are lacking and the establishment of the External Action Service?"
"Mr Van Rompuy, the European Union walks on two legs."
"The Member States and governments and the peoples."
"We are looking for the head, and you are the head!"
"Moreover, you should not be in the passenger seat, but in the driving seat, and the future of the European Union will depend on your ability to steer the Member States towards a political Union."
"Thank you for being here, Mr Van Rompuy."
"You are a man of great quality."
"Do not fear the peoples and their representatives."
"Love them and they will love you back."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in defining the mid-term strategy, the Union will have to take account of the effects of the economic crisis, which is today penalising this part of the world - and other parts too - and, of course, of the shortcomings that gave rise to the modest results of the previous strategy, the 2000 Lisbon Strategy."
"The crisis gives us some specific pointers with regard to development and full employment, if we want to incorporate - as I believe is necessary - this objective in our action."
"Firstly, regulatory instruments and supervision of the financial system and of the banks are required to ensure that the negative conditions that are severely penalising us today are not repeated."
"Secondly, we will need to invest heavily in innovation, research and training, particularly if we want to move towards a green economy."
"For substantial investment to be possible, however, Europe must equip itself with Eurobonds and with a system of rewards and penalties so that it can achieve its economic objectives."
"Those are the main shortcomings of Lisbon I."
"We will have to introduce uniform redistributive policies with regard to both taxation and pay."
"Moreover, a coordinated industrial policy is required for sectors in order to protect the historic manufacturing structure of our region of the world."
"Lastly, we need to reshape and relaunch social dialogue as a force for cohesion and for curbing the dangers of long-term unemployment with which we have to come to terms."
"(ES) Madam President, President Van Rompuy, President Barroso - who is not here, but whom I am also addressing - the truth is that it has been very good to see you together and, in my opinion, this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the common strategy in the next ten years and, in my view, this is extremely important."
"What most interested me about the proposal that we have seen in writing and what you have said is that there only need to be a few objectives: only the top-priority objectives; that they need to be tangible, that we need to be able to measure them and they need to be constantly evaluated in order to see whether or not we are making progress in that direction."
"I think this is fundamental, and it is a substantial change from the Lisbon Strategy."
"I am going to highlight one objective: the internal market."
"The European internal market was conceived more than 20 years ago."
"Twenty years later, there is a long way to go before we have a truly internal European market in the majority of sectors."
"In some cases, this is because they are very new sectors, such as the digital market, but in other cases, there is such a degree of fragmentation and such barriers that we are depriving the European economy of the large-scale framework that it needs in order to be able to really develop all the competitiveness that it needs, which will bring about growth, which, in turn, will bring about employment."
"Mr Van Rompuy, Mr Barroso, we need a great deal of political impetus: 'business as usual' can no longer be a tool."
"We need a great deal of leadership, and you have a big responsibility."
"You do, of course, have my full support for making this possible."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, as a member of the Trio Presidency and as a Hungarian MEP, I follow with great appreciation the activity of President Van Rompuy for the strong European commitment and faith with which he took on his new duties."
"It is absolutely true that now is the time to determine how the Presidency of the European Council will operate."
"I am convinced that Europe, in the throes of a crisis, needs a strong hand and orientation at the helm."
"It is also a question of credibility for the new programme to avoid the fate of its predecessor, the Lisbon Strategy."
"I say this also as a member from a previously communist country."
"In that nook of Europe, there is - perhaps understandably - a natural aversion to bombastic long-term plans."
"I have one institutional and one substantive comment."
"Concerning the institution: we have to decide to whom this strategy is addressed."
"If it is addressed to EU leaders, then what has been done until now is adequate and the tight schedule is a good thing."
"However, if we think it is addressed to the citizens of the EU, whom we want to win over to our side, whom we want to work with and not against in shaping a stronger, more competitive Union that delivers more benefits to citizens than it does now, then we must proceed in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon and honestly involve the European Parliament and, what is more, national parliaments as well."
"Today's debate is no substitute for dealing with the topic in this House in the usual manner, with the rapporteur's statement, in the committees and the political groups."
"As for the substantive comment, the most important goal must be job creation."
"That must be the starting point for all new strategy."
"How to accomplish this?"
"We know very little about that at this point."
"We know this much: fewer priorities, pinpointing bottlenecks, tighter economic policy coordination."
"That is all fine, but please, take into consideration the following: first, let us not throw out that which has been working well."
"The EU has been strengthened by the existing community policies, and moreover, it goes against the founding treaties to discard cohesion and agricultural policies that serve well the interests of EU citizens."
"Secondly, the new strategy is to serve the interests of all regions, not only those of certain companies or countries."
"Through cohesion, the EU's competitiveness will grow as well."
"Thirdly, let us tailor the strategy to the countries."
"That is what will lend credibility to the whole thing."
"(EL) Madam President, this is a very interesting debate being held here today on the strategy for 2020, but we all know full well that the informal European Council on 11 February was dominated by the so-called Greek question."
"We also know that the informal summit culminated in a statement by the Heads of State or Government giving political support to Greece, expressing a readiness to take action to stabilise the euro and pointing out that Greece has not requested any financial support from the European Union."
"I should like to take this opportunity to remind the House that the Greek Government and the Greek Prime Minister have repeatedly emphasised that Greece is not asking for money, it is not asking for German or Austrian or Swedish or any other European taxpayer to pay its debts, which it will deal with, which it will limit through its own efforts based on the measures which have already been announced."
"While we are on the subject, Mr Verhofstadt, it is not correct that Greece has said that it has provided all the information on the Goldman Sachs bond; it has said that it will provide it promptly."
"Moreover - I cannot see the President of the European Commission here; I should like to express my perplexity as to why explanations were only requested from the Greek authorities and from Greece about a practice which was applied to saturation point by numerous Member States in the euro area over the ten years from 1998 to 2008, as reported in numerous articles in the foreign press recently."
"Greece is not asking for money."
"It is asking for something else."
"Something which should be self-evident, not only by reason of its participation in the euro area, but also, more generally, by reason of its participation in the European Union: an expression of political support, solidarity and basic and honest trust."
"Support not just in words; support which has substance and content and will not be removed and undermined as soon as we are no longer behind closed doors."
"Greece is asking for its partners not to do or say anything to fuel speculation and to stop sowing doubt as to whether or not Greece will be able to achieve results with the measures it has announced because, in the final analysis, that would undermine the efforts which the country is making."
"We must not bury our heads in the sand."
"We all know that, through Greece, speculators are targeting the euro area and the euro."
"So let us take all the measures needed to protect the euro area and the euro."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must express my sincere regret, and that of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which I have the honour of chairing, that no reference whatsoever has been made to the agri-food sector in the 2020 strategy."
"It is absurd that the Commission's proposed strategy for the next 10 years does not include the central issue of the challenge relating to food security, growth and job retention in rural areas."
"Madam President, how can one conceive of a green and sustainable Europe without taking into account that 45% of all European territory is managed by farmers?"
"How can one fail to take into account the nearly 30 million people who work on that territory?"
"These are workers who must be safeguarded and protected."
"Before we focus on new jobs, we must protect the existing ones."
"I would remind you that agriculture provides a whole host of essential services relating to, among other things, food, biodiversity, the landscape and the environment, and these are tasks that are performed for the sake of the social and economic life of rural areas."
"The Spanish Presidency has also insisted strongly on the need for a powerful common agricultural policy."
"I am therefore concerned about this very serious omission, which I hope Parliament will be able to put right."
"(FI) Madam President, this is the year of the tiger, and China is an economic tiger."
"At the moment, India is a colossal building site, and I think that Indian development will have a huge impact on Europe."
"It is precisely for this reason that we need a new rhythm, the new beginning that EU 2020 symbolises."
"We need a common economic policy, an intelligent tax policy and the courage to acknowledge our structural weaknesses: research and product development."
"These issues have been very well presented here."
"I have two questions."
"How in future are we to monitor the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact on the basis of this Greek tragedy and the lesson it has taught us?"
"My other question is this: what carrots and sticks are we to employ to enable the EU 2020 strategy to be more successful than the Lisbon tragedy, since the Member States could not care less about it?"
"(RO) Madam President, President in Office of the Council, I am pleased that you are here with us."
"I do not understand why the Council is attempting to make a decision in such haste, without any serious consultation with the European Parliament."
"We need the 2020 strategy as the Lisbon Strategy has not proved to be effective."
"However, the documents which are going round are general and fail to provide any clear statements referring to the future challenges."
"One example is the social aspect."
"The main social problems in Europe are the increased ageing of the population and the lack of high qualifications for workers."
"In these circumstances, allocating less than 2% of GDP to research, development and innovation is a first mistake which needs to be quickly rectified."
"Research and development could be based on public-private partnerships and on encouraging business people to invest in research laboratories and institutes in order to discourage the brain drain to the United States or Japan."
"(SK) I will try to be brief, in order to keep to the limit."
"I am disappointed that the President of the Commission is no longer sitting here, but I believe that the man responsible for interinstitutional cooperation is sitting here."
"As an important step towards making strategy 2020 a success, I would therefore like to speak in particular about how essential it is for the various EU institutions to stop competing against each other and for us to cooperate together in earnest on the instruments without which it will be impossible to achieve the objectives of strategy 2020."
"It is, therefore, very important for national egoisms to be genuinely transformed into a sense of national responsibility and also a sense of responsibility at the European level, because unless we address the issue of harmonising social policy and harmonising tax policy as soon as possible, it will not be possible to fulfil the objectives of economic policy or of our common European economy which will turn us into a genuinely competitive region in a globalised world."
"Madam President, I am most grateful to President Van Rompuy for describing his job spec, but I still do not quite understand why he is declining to answer my parliamentary question."
"I would like to ask him to reconsider his approach to the issue of parliamentary questions."
"Can I also apologise to President Van Rompuy for the disgraceful performance of Nigel Farage."
"I guarantee him that the great majority of British MEPs are going to treat him with great respect."
"(EL) Madam President, the eyes of the whole of Europe - and not just Europe - have been on Greece recently, as numerous speakers have already said."
"Against the backdrop of global economic crisis, it is not, of course, just Greece that has serious economic problems."
"There are other countries as well, as we all know."
"We are witnessing an unprecedented speculative attack which - I am sorry to say - has lately taken the form of slander of the worst form by some of the media."
"Be that as it may, you can all be certain that Greece is not bankrupt, Greece is not collapsing."
"Moreover, our country has never asked for financial support."
"What it has asked for and is asking for is political support."
"What it has asked for and is asking for is real proof of solidarity from the other Member States within the framework of European Monetary Union because, in the final analysis, that is what is at stake."
"(RO) At the start of the year, the unemployment rate reached 10%, while the deficit has grown in numerous Member States."
"Europe's citizens are waiting on immediate solutions to the current fundamental challenges: demographic changes and climate change, as well as the economic and financial crisis."
"The European Union must invest, as a priority, in creating and preserving jobs in education, health care, agriculture and transport and energy infrastructures."
"The European Union needs a sustainable energy strategy and a modern, safe and efficient transport infrastructure."
"We must invest in energy efficiency measures for the benefit of both housing and modernising industrial facilities, thereby enabling us to create more than two million new jobs by 2020."
"In addition, reducing polluting emissions means modernising industrial facilities across the European Union and not relocating European industry to third countries."
"Last but not least, the ageing population and fall in the birth rate necessitate reform to the social systems so that every citizen in the European Union can be guaranteed a decent living."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the session went a little bit over time and the President of the Commission had to leave because of other obligations, but it is an honour for me to answer on behalf of President Barroso and on behalf of the Commission."
"I would like to start by thanking you all for a fascinating debate, for many interesting ideas, and for the enthusiasm and support you are showing for the EU 2020 strategy."
"Without your support, the EU 2020 cannot and will not succeed."
"I can assure you that the Commission will be very bold; the EU 2020 will put citizens, employment and reduction of poverty at its core and centre."
"I can also assure you that we have learned the lessons of the Lisbon Strategy and therefore we will focus on a lesser number of targets and we will definitely improve on governance."
"At the Commission, we are very much encouraged by the strong interest and what we hope will be strong support from the European Parliament."
"We are also very much encouraged by the sense of urgency in the European Council where it is very clear that the atmosphere today is very different from that of five years ago when we were discussing the parameters of the Lisbon Strategy."
"But we need to do more; we need to get local and regional support for this strategy and, most importantly, we need to get the people behind it."
"We must make sure that they will not see it as another administrative exercise but that they will see it as an approach on how to improve life in Europe and in their countries and regions."
"I would like to ask you, honourable Members, to help us with this task."
"Let us not compete among the institutions, let us cooperate, let us focus on the priorities and let us deliver the concrete results."
"In the EU 2020 strategy, we would like to introduce a three-interlocking-pillar system based on a smart, greener and inclusive economy and we would like to build upon these pillars flexible initiatives which would be aimed at the bottlenecks, at the problems which are slowing the European economy, which are blocking it from using its full potential."
"We would like to focus more on education and training, so that the labour force in Europe will maintain the competitive edge which Europe deserves."
"We will keep the EU 2020 strategy linked to the stability and growth pact, because a solid fiscal position is key to the economic stability."
"We talked much today about Greece and I would like to assure you that there was consensus that the euro area Member States would take determined and coordinated action if needed to safeguard financial stability in the euro area."
"The Commission will closely work together with Greece and monitor how it implements the recommendations."
"A mission led by the Commission with the ECB and drawing on the IMF for technical support is now in Athens to assess the need for Greece to take additional measures."
"Let me be very clear; we have the tools to safeguard financial stability in the euro area if needed; this involves, in particular, the euro area Members, the Commission and the European Central Bank and we stand ready to put in place a European framework for coordinating the action."
"But each stage in this process must be allowed to take its course, and it is now for Greece to press on with the reforms and to put the necessary measures in place."
"I believe that we are ready to take bold action, be it on the EU 2020 strategy or on the situation in Greece."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad that we have had this debate;"
"I am glad that I accepted your invitation to come here, at the very beginning of the process of the 2020 strategy, because the debate has only just begun."
"We had a debate just recently, on 11 February, we will have a spring Council at the end of March, and we will finalise the 2020 strategy, or the strategy for employment and economic growth, at the end of June."
"We therefore have a considerable amount of time in which to exchange views and determine the course of action once and for all."
"I therefore welcome this European ambition that I have found here this afternoon, and I welcome this sense of urgency that I have encountered this afternoon."
"There was one speech for which I have nothing but contempt, but I am not going to comment on that further."
"As far as the economic strategy is concerned, I will make a distinction between three periods."
"The first period is the period that we are still in now, in other words, the financial crisis and all its consequences."
"Allow me to use a different language from what I have heard this afternoon throughout the entire debate."
"I will explain."
"I would like to use a language that also reflects what is positive about the European Union, because surprising though it may seem, there are also positive things that have happened recently."
"We have drawn consequences and learnt lessons from the crisis of the 1930s."
"We now find ourselves one year on from the major crisis and, in fact, in 2010, we now have positive growth in most countries once more."
"That did not happen during the 1930s."
"The crisis actually lasted until the end of the decade."
"Why do we have this positive growth now?"
"Because we have taken measures."
"We have taken measures to save the financial institutions, not because we particularly like them as such, but because, without them, there is no economy."
"We have conducted an intelligent monetary policy."
"We have injected liquidity into the economy, something that no one did 70 years ago."
"For at least 16 countries, we have created a zone of monetary stability, in spite of all the problems."
"In the 1930s, we had competitive devaluations."
"We have not had them today."
"We have conducted a risky budgetary policy using budgetary deficits to stimulate the economy."
"We did not do what was done in the 1930s, namely restore budgetary equilibrium as quickly as possible."
"Therefore, we have protected our internal market, which is not perfect."
"We must improve it, and Mr Monti will provide us with some concrete proposals."
"However, we have not lapsed back into the protectionism of the 1930s."
"Therefore, we have learnt some lessons from the major crisis that we have just experienced."
"I would even go a step further."
"It is thanks to the European Union that the G20 was born; we were the ones who took the initiative to create this embryonic world governance."
"It is the first time that the big powers, new and old, have come together to combat the crisis, in an imperfect way, but we will continue to work along these lines."
"So Europe, the European Union, should not always be put on the defensive."
"There are also some very positive things that have been produced."
"Now we must leave this strategy, this so-called exit strategy, behind."
"We have to find a balance between abandoning the budgetary stimuli too quickly and returning, in the medium term, to budgetary equilibrium, which is absolutely necessary to fund our pension system, our social security system and our health care system."
"So it is a difficult balance that we have to find, and the Stability and Growth Pact provides us with the means to do it, because it does not require an immediate return to budgetary equilibrium."
"It requires a step-by-step approach, whereby we first reach a stage of 3% and then, in the medium term, budgetary equilibrium."
"I think that we have conducted and we are continuing to conduct a wise policy."
"As far as the Lisbon Strategy is concerned, we know its handicaps, but we must not forget either that the financial and economic crisis has completely disrupted the implementation of the Lisbon agenda."
"There have, of course, been omissions; I am not going to list them here, they are well known."
"I will say this, however: we need some major reforms, or important reforms, and these important reforms, at European level and nationally, will demand budgetary choices."
"It is not by chance - and I have repeated this in the written conclusions that you have read - that we want to link the budgetary discussion, effectively in its legal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact, to economic reforms."
"This is because, if we say that we need to do more research and development, for example, then we must make provision for that in the national budgets and in the European Union's financial perspective."
"That means that some budgetary choices will need to be made."
"Another consequence of the choices we are making for the Lisbon Strategy is that the goals that we are proposing will not always be soft goals."
"It so happens that they could be hard goals."
"This is where it gets difficult."
"There is, on the one hand, the demand for reforms and, on the other, the implementation of the reforms."
"I do not say that I have heard it here, but outside this House, at European level, people are demanding hard measures, major reforms, hard reforms, and when people go back to their countries, I see few results of all that."
"We therefore need a consistent position."
"It is not just the European Union that will implement reforms."
"We can encourage them, stimulate them and provide the right framework for them, but it is at national level that a large number of reforms will have to be made, and therefore, it is a matter of demonstrating significant political will, and political commitment is the most important thing."
"It is often said that we need more binding measures."
"However, we should think about this."
"I have made quite a few proposals, which I believe are more intelligent than binding measures."
"However, even the Stability and Growth Pact, which contains many binding measures, has failed to put some countries back on track."
"Therefore, the method is not everything, the method does not resolve everything, and without political engagement, without commitment, the method is worthless."
"As for the economic strategy, it is all very well for some to say that we need more constraints."
"However, as far as economic guidelines are concerned, the Treaty of Lisbon does not make provision for that."
"I myself did not draw up the Treaty of Lisbon, others did, but it does not provide for any sanctions, penalties, or negative measures as regards the implementation of the economic guidelines."
"Take a close look at Article 121 so that you are fully aware of this."
"Political commitment at both European and national level is therefore crucial, and without this political commitment, nothing will be done."
"One final word about Greece."
"I believe that we have sent out the right message."
"We have conveyed the message of the responsibility of the Greek Government, which must handle an extremely difficult situation, a situation that it inherited."
"It is taking some brave measures."
"On 11 February, it told us that if the current measures are not enough to achieve a reduction in the deficit of 4% of GDP in 2010, it would take additional measures."
"We have made a commitment to carry out more monitoring, not only on the initiative of the European Commission, but also with the help of the European Central Bank and even of experts from the International Monetary Fund."
"I therefore believe that we really have framed and defined very clearly the aspect of responsibility."
"If necessary, there is, of course, an element of solidarity."
"Greece has said that it does not want to use that, but we have provided for two messages: a message of responsibility and a message of solidarity, if necessary."
"Naturally, we must draw conclusions from what has happened in Greece in recent years."
"In the euro area too, we must be more proactive with regard to both data collection and politics itself."
"This crisis was also a challenge, a challenge in the sense that we must practise the policy of coordination more."
"In fact, every crisis is a challenge."
"We must learn lessons from every crisis."
"Well, we will learn them."
"In the same way as we learnt lessons from the crisis of the 1930s, we must now also learn lessons from the financial crisis: more regulation, more monitoring of bonuses, a more far-reaching banking policy."
"However, we must also learn all the lessons from the experience of Greece and others."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that I have felt the same ambition in this House; I have felt the same political will to pursue an economic policy and strategy which can cope with the difficulties that we face today."
"As many of you have said, this is not just the responsibility of one or two people; all the European institutions and all the Member States must assume collective responsibility."
"Otherwise, we will not save our social model; otherwise, we will lose our position in the world."
"It is therefore in this frame of mind that I have come to meet you here this afternoon, and it is in this frame of mind that I will continue my work."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"It was indeed a great pleasure to have you here with us for your maiden appearance in plenary."
"In Greece, we have an expression for someone who assumes tough new duties."
"We say: ÏÎ¹Î´Î·ÏÎ¿ÎºÎ­ÏÎ±Î»Î¿Ï, which means may you have an iron head in order to sustain everything that will fall on it during a difficult course."
"I think you have exhibited that; if you do not have it, you are developing it."
"Thank you so much for being here with us."
"The economic crisis has left a deep negative imprint on the EU countries' potential for economic growth."
"We have followed the debates on this topic and seen that attention has been focused on the measures for exiting the crisis and reviving economic growth financially."
"It is undoubtedly a good idea to tackle the problems in order of severity."
"However, it is important for us to realise that the situation is no longer the same as it was prior to the crisis."
"It is actually the economic model which needs to change."
"It must be based more on innovation and non-polluting energy sources, and focus on people's state of health."
"We cannot have a dynamic economy unless we have motivated workers."
"We cannot have a sustainable economy either if we support environmental protection only with half-measures."
"I believe that in order to restore the potential for economic growth, we need to start with changing the economic model itself, which must focus on what generates innovation and personal motivation."
"Exiting from the crisis is basically not a problem about economic or fiscal policy."
"Europe has already had a lesson, having been unable to implement the goals set out in the Lisbon Strategy and I hope that it will learn from the mistakes that caused the economic and financial crisis."
"Therefore, in future, I call on you to pay greater attention firstly to the creation of jobs and to create not just any jobs, but try to ensure high quality full employment, taking into account the needs of the labour market and ensuring social inclusion."
"Secondly, it is very important to fight for gender equality and the abolition of poverty, especially with regard to people in the most vulnerable groups, as they are most affected by poverty during these hard times."
"I would also like to draw attention to education systems and the importance of acquiring new skills."
"Since the labour markets of the EU Member States are experiencing dynamic change, it is necessary to ensure that workers have the required skills for future labour markets."
"Therefore, it is imperative to invest in internal staff training and lifelong learning."
"We ought to pay most attention to one of society's most severe problems, growing youth unemployment."
"If young people are not given opportunities to enter the labour market, then there is a danger that Europe will lose a whole generation of young people."
"At the informal meeting of EU Heads of State or Government on the Europe 2020 strategy on 11 February, the very important matter of governance was raised."
"Although the European Council is very ambitious in this matter, I would nevertheless call on you to ensure even more active participation by the European Parliament, national parliaments and various Council sectors."
"in writing. - (PT) In this debate, those who hold responsibility within the European Union remain far removed from the real problems of citizens."
"The examples which we continue to find on our visits and in our contact with workers, farmers, fishermen and owners of micro- and small enterprises demonstrate that the approaches and policies of the European Union are only serving to render employment more precarious and to aggravate unemployment and exploitation."
"At a time when unemployment figures have topped 23 million and poverty affects more than 85 million people, it is not acceptable to persist with the policies which have caused this situation."
"We therefore insist on the need to terminate the Stability Pact and to replace it with a Development and Employment Pact prioritising the creation of jobs with rights and an increase in production."
"It is necessary to break with the so-called Lisbon Strategy and instead back a Social Progress Strategy which gives priority to the fight against poverty, supports quality public services and social resources, and promotes equality and women's rights."
"That means developing a budgetary policy which speeds up the allocation of Community support funds and transfers them more quickly and easily to the Member States..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 170 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The EU 2020 strategy can only succeed if the Member States demonstrate sufficient commitment to carrying it out."
"Besides unequivocal acceptance of national responsibilities, the key to success lies in implementing Community policies with their concomitant resources provided for catching up, regional development and agriculture, which will all contribute to economic growth and job creation."
"The top-down working method now taking shape, based on the heightened political accountability of prime ministers, also provides stronger guarantees of a successful execution than was the case for the Lisbon Strategy."
"The 2020 strategy also sets out the next budgetary term's priorities without providing for detailed discussion at present."
"Consequently, one has to emphasise right now the importance of a common agricultural and cohesion policy for the next seven-year budget beginning in 2014."
"Without economic, social and territorial cohesion, there is no strong, competitive Europe."
"Convergence between the regions strengthens Europe's competitiveness."
"Ladies and gentlemen, one of the most important challenges facing the EU is the reassessment of the Lisbon Strategy, with the associated fight against poverty and exclusion and the strengthening of social cohesion."
"The 2020 initiative, which constitutes one of the mainstays of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency, has to respond to the long-term demographic and social challenges facing the continent."
"This means no less than a rethinking of the European labour market and educational system."
"In the face of the failure of the present European Employment Strategy, the 2020 programme must indeed create more and better jobs, with primary consideration given to the increased participation of women and disadvantaged groups in the labour market."
"It is commendable that both the European Commission's agenda and the action plan of the incoming Trio Presidency place emphasis on factors indispensable to the programme's success, such as measures targeting undeclared work, the black economy and early school leavers, as well as improving self-employment conditions."
"Since socio-economic exclusion is the result of numerous interdependent factors, solutions may come only from a more comprehensive action plan addressing all areas together, rather than from the project-based ideas that have hitherto prevailed."
"In order to be successful, isolated initiatives must be abandoned in favour of measures that are woven into a balanced policy package that focuses on early interventions and can ensure genuine improvement in each of the true measures of social exclusion reflected in the Laeken indicators."
"The current economic crisis is the most severe in recent decades, with its impact being reflected in the reduction by half of growth potential across the EU."
"This economic decline is also going hand in hand with an increase in the population ageing rate, which is hampering the efforts to help the EU economies recover."
"Against this backdrop, the 2020 strategy, which is intended to be a continuation of the Lisbon Strategy, must create the conditions required for sustainable growth and fiscal consolidation."
"In fact, lifelong learning must be much more accessible, with universities being much more open to accepting non-mainstream students."
"Better correlation between supply and demand and greater labour mobility will provide workers with more opportunities in places where there is greatest demand for their skills."
"Modern social security and pension systems are required in order to reduce poverty and exclusion."
"Employment policy must focus on labour market flexibility where employees assume responsibility for their working life through ongoing training, adapting to change and mobility."
"It is vital to adapt to the current climate of economic crisis and an ageing European population so that we are able to provide a sufficient level of support to people who are temporarily out of work."
"I share the sentiments of fellow Members who have raised the issue concerning the absence of agriculture from the EU 2020 strategy."
"I believe that agriculture is an area which can contribute to the European Union's development and is, at the same time, an important sector because it is at the heart of the European way of life."
"Last but not least, particular attention must be focused on agriculture because it has been hit extremely hard by the economic crisis."
"In order to ascertain the extent of the impact, we only need to look at the reduction in real income per agricultural worker, which has reached as much as 35% in some European Union Member States."
"in writing. - In line with the opening statement by President Van Rompuy, my intervention is devoted to the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"While, in theory, the creation of the High Representative's double-hatted position looks good, in practice, given its 'uniqueness', it creates problems unforeseen by the authors of the treaty."
"In the absence of a deputy, equally double-hatted, the High Representative will more and more have to choose between staying in Brussels and being present, for instance, at the European Parliament, and flying to a foreign capital, where the EU needs equally high representation."
"Of course, Lady Ashton can 'deputise', but, if she does, it will have to be on an 'ad hoc' basis, at the expense of either the Council or the Commission."
"And if the 'rotating Presidency' steps back in to restore the balance, we end up with more bureaucracy, rather than less bureaucracy."
"Europe 2020 must not repeat the failures of its predecessor, the Lisbon Strategy."
"The new strategy has been shaped, to a significant degree, by the economic crisis, the effects of which it is going to have to tackle."
"At the same time, we must make up for our neglect."
"Since the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact are so rigorous, how did the EU come to have a deficit of 7% and debt of 80% of GDP?"
"Who is responsible for this?"
"What we most want for the EU is a return to a path of rapid growth, and this is primarily what the strategy should help accomplish."
"The current provisions of the strategy do not show how to achieve this, nor do they show how to reconcile Europe's social achievements with demographic problems, with the poor performance of the health insurance system or the failing pension and benefits system."
"Furthermore, what about hours of work?"
"Finally, what about the establishment of a system for the oversight and monitoring of banks and other financial institutions?"
"Or how do we want to increase productivity?"
"We need a new approach to these new challenges."
"The priority of the new Euro 2020 strategy is to be a more intelligent and ecological knowledge-based market economy."
"To achieve this objective, we should, above all, concentrate on strengthening the single market and increasing the free flow of services."
"The role of the European Community should be to promote entrepreneurship, and also to simplify the registration of businesses by lifting legal and economic barriers."
"Support, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, is a significant matter."
"Lifting the requirement for micro-enterprises to submit annual financial statements and improving access to credit may be important steps in this direction."
"The results of the Eurobarometer survey on people's entrepreneurial mindset show that the European Union is still behind the United States, but also that over half of young EU residents would like to become entrepreneurs in the next five years."
"I also think it is important to concentrate on creating economic growth based on knowledge, and on creating a competitive, cohesive and more environment-friendly economy."
"This is also why we have to pay attention to, and increase spending on, the development and preparation of young people to meet long-term challenges."
"The EU should implement a European digital agenda as quickly as possible to contribute to the establishment of a truly single, common market in Internet trade, so that consumers will be able to take advantage of competitive price offers in other Member States and SMEs will be able to operate in the European market unhindered."
"The EU 2020 strategy must stand on two pillars."
"On the one hand, solidarity among Member States which guarantees that no Member State will be left behind in the crisis."
"On the other hand, Member States also have to show solidarity with the community by faithfully carrying out jointly decided obligations."
"During the debate on the future of the EU, we should never lose sight of the already functioning policies."
"Common agricultural and coherence policies are the true results of European integration and symbols of solidarity between Member States and nations."
"As a Hungarian Member of Parliament and a politician from a new Member State, I consider the new priorities formulated by the European Commission as having equal importance: building a knowledge-based society, fostering innovation, strengthening social inclusion, creation of new jobs and a more resolute stand against climate change within the framework of sustainable development."
"The weakening of the previous common policies cannot be allowed to be the price paid for stronger cooperation in the above areas."
"The food safety guaranteed by the common agricultural policy is becoming ever more important in the 21st century as food and drinking water assume the same strategic significance as oil did in the 20th century."
"If we really want to strengthen the global competitive position of the EU, we cannot allow certain regions to be left behind because of obsolete infrastructure and poor educational, social and health services."
"Therefore, there is a continued need for a strong cohesion policy based on solidarity."
"The EU 2020 strategy must mark a breakthrough."
"Otherwise, EU 2020 will be a Lisbon 2, a strategy which will have to be replaced in 10 years' time by another new strategy."
"EU 2020 must clearly mark the start of the post-Lisbon phase."
"We must set the priorities for the strategy which we are launching so that the reforms which will be generated by EU 2020 will survive in the medium and long term."
"There are three priority areas which must feature in EU 2020 without fail."
"The first one is active support for SMEs, based on the correlation of Community programmes with macro-economic policies."
"This approach will guarantee a healthy economic environment for private entities."
"The second is an education system which prepares the workforce based on the demands of the market."
"This process will ensure a better employment level in Member States."
"Finally, the European Parliament must have an increased role."
"This will allow real information from Member States to be used and prevent the disparities widening between Member States' economies."
"An EU 2020 strategy organised according to clear priorities will quickly revive economic growth in the EU, especially in the context of the current financial and economic pressures."
"Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010) (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010)."
"Mr President, the European Union is preparing, in Geneva, in Brussels and in the capitals of third countries, for the first session of this year of the Human Rights Council."
"The Human Rights Council is a forum for debating the human rights situation in all the regions of the world, and the efforts of the international community to improve the human rights situation, which is one of the principles, one of the elements, one of the essential characteristics of the spirit of the European Union, the thing that gives it its true identity in the world."
"The Presidency of the Council has taken the role that it has to play at this time very seriously."
"It has taken the challenges that the European Union has to tackle during these sessions of the Human Rights Council very seriously."
"Proof of this is that the First Deputy Prime Minster of the Spanish Government, MarÃ­a Teresa FernÃ¡ndez de la Vega - in this case acting as the representative of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union - will be attending the 'High-level segment', which is going to begin the Council's 13th session."
"The Presidency is therefore going to have an active presence in the work of the Council."
"We will defend the European Union's positions on matters with special implications for numerous Member States and, in addition to the national initiatives, the European Union is going to table country resolutions."
"We continue to believe that the Council needs to have instruments in order to defend human rights, in order to respond to situations of serious human rights violations, either through a specific country mandate - which is the case of Burma or the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - or through mandates on specific subjects within a country, as we hope will be the case for the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"These situations need to be monitored by the international community and by the Human Rights Council if we want the Council to maintain its credibility."
"One of the items that are going to be on the agenda for the Council's forthcoming sessions is something that we are going to discuss later, in another item this afternoon, which is the special sessions on Gaza and the Goldstone report."
"The European Union considers - as we will say once again later - that this report is a reliable analysis, and the European Union stressed the importance of conducting adequate, reliable research into the possible violations of international human rights legislation and international humanitarian law."
"Finally, I would like to discuss the problem of the Council Review."
"This is going to be a crucial year for the negotiations on the review of the Council's work, which is going to take place specifically in 2011."
"The European Union is beginning to work on, but intends to consolidate, a clear position, a clear strategy for the Union so that we can maintain an active role and a commitment to the protection of and respect for human rights."
"In any case, it is clear that the European Union is going to continue to advocate the independence of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as it always has done, along with the independence of special procedures, the participation of non-governmental organisations in the Human Rights Council, the capacity of the Council to tackle key serious human rights violations, and the establishment of country mandates."
"Spain, and the Spanish Presidency, are aware that it has taken over the rotating Presidency at a crucial time for the Union and for the United Nations in terms of protecting and promoting human rights in the world."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has also opened up a new phase, as it has in so many other areas, in terms of the Union's external action, and we hope that our joint work, under the leadership of the High Representative, will therefore make the European Union's voice clearer in defending the fundamental principles of the work of the Human Rights Council."
"We also hope that this phase of moving towards a more active, transparent and efficient Council benefits from the transitional phase that the Union is going through under a Presidency - which I currently represent - which will do everything in its power to ensure that the paths taken by the Union and by the Council from now on lead to the same goal, which is the promotion and protection of human rights in the world."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I find it very appropriate that I am here today for the first time on the issue of human rights, which fits the priorities of my portfolio so well."
"The Commission very much subscribes to the presentation by the Spanish Presidency, and I would like to add two sets of remarks to what has been presented here with regard to the priorities of the forthcoming session and how the EU would align with those priorities."
"The first concerns thematic issues."
"The EU and the group of Latin American countries are jointly working on a draft resolution on the rights of the child, with a specific focus on the fight against sexual violence against children."
"The Commission is very concerned at the increase in sexual violence in zones of conflict and crisis situations and the spillover on the most vulnerable, especially children."
"The EU will, in accordance with the European consensus on humanitarian aid, ensure that this is properly addressed in the resolution."
"The EU would also actively participate in a panel on the rights of persons with disabilities."
"There is a very clear link with our EU internal policies, as we will soon conclude the accession process to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"Another thematic area of particular interest is the right to food, which is consistent with the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the human rights of internally displaced persons who, unlike refugees, are not adequately protected by international conventions, and we will press on in connection with this point."
"The second remark I would like to make concerns the support from the EU for the adoption by the plenary of the reports of the Universal Periodic Reviews concerning states that went through this process in December."
"This is a very important moment, in which the states reviewed can make public the commitments that they make for the improvement of the human rights situation."
"At the same time, states may choose to request international assistance for the implementation of these commitments."
"The Commission continues to remain very open to discussing with partners ways and means to support the implementation of the recommendations of these reviews."
"Very critical, as already stressed by the Spanish Presidency, is the fact that the impact of this process depends, first and foremost, on the transparency and openness displayed by EU Member States, because we can only be effective by leading by our own example."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament is going to adopt a resolution on the upcoming session of the Human Rights Council."
"I also welcome the fact that the European Parliament will be sending a delegation to the Human Rights Council, since our recommendations to the EU Council are usually tabled on how to improve the work of the Human Rights Council and strengthen the role of the European Union in it."
"This 13th session is the most important one to take place in 2010, and it will include high-level meetings and discussions with government ministers on a number of important issues already mentioned by the Commissioner and the Minister, such as, for example, the impact of the global financial crisis on the human rights situation worldwide."
"We welcome the fact that our American partners are heavily engaged in the work of the Human Rights Council."
"However, we should note with concern that some countries are trying to hijack the whole process and undermine the credibility of the Human Rights Council."
"Iran has signalled that it might run in the elections for a place on the Council."
"It would be highly regrettable if Iran was elected, as this would in fact increase the number of countries with problematic human rights records on the Council."
"The Human Rights Council would then risk becoming as defunct and inefficient as its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights."
"In other words, the credibility of the Human Rights Council as such is at stake, and we should therefore do everything we can to maintain the Human Rights Council's authority."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, I would like to begin by welcoming this Parliament's involvement in UN initiatives."
"In the autumn, we lobbied in New York for the appointment of a new Assistant Secretary-General to raise the priority for human nights in the UN, and next month we will once again be at the Human Rights Council itself: not simply in dialogue with our EU representatives, but also working with third countries as part of Europe's common efforts to promote respect for human rights with the rest of the world."
"I am proud that, in Geneva, we see that Europe is a champion of human rights and, with the work due to start in June this year, our resolution today says that we should be a champion of further reform of the Human Rights Council itself."
"The Council remains too politicised, and our text today justly criticises those delegates who cynically lined up in their cars outside the UN in Geneva at 6 a.m. in order that they could be first in to fill up the speakers list to help Sri Lanka in its 'no action' motion to evade criticisms of violations in that country and to evade the spirit of the setting up of the Human Rights Council: that it should work throughout the year to deal with human rights abuses whenever and wherever they occur."
"In this Parliament, we agree with many of the principles enunciated by the Spanish Presidency in terms of further reform, and I would like to join with my friend Mrs Andrikiento say that it will be a further death blow to the Council if Iran, with its devastating human rights record, is elected unopposed next time, as some fear."
"The hardest test on human rights for any nation is when we stand accused of human rights abuse."
"That is why I am very pleased that, at the organisational meeting in Geneva on 18 February, both the European Union and the United States spoke in favour of the joint study on secret detention being presented to the Human Rights Council this time."
"We will not always agree with criticisms, but we must always be open to them if we expect others to do the same."
"(ET) High Representative, Commissioner, we in the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe want the European Union to be visible at the forthcoming 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council."
"As the co-author of this resolution, I particularly want to draw attention to points 9 and 13 in the resolution, which deal with matters relating to Iran."
"It is unacceptable to us, the ALDE Group, that the UN Human Rights Council is unable - not to mention unwilling - to react with the necessary speed to the human rights crises in Afghanistan, Guinea, Iran, Yemen and Iraq."
"The point of the Human Rights Council, which brings together all the countries in the world, is to constantly monitor the human rights situation on the territory of all Member States and to react without delay to any worsening of the situation."
"The current sluggish handling of the situation clearly gives a sign of the weakness and inability of the organisation to adequately implement the goals it has set itself."
"The weakness of the organisation is also evident from Iran's candidacy at the election of the UN Human Rights Council taking place in May 2010, which is quite comical."
"The very thought of it is absurd, considering the helpless attempts by Iran's theocratic regime to suppress the civil disorder which has seized the whole country using a repressive apparatus."
"The only possibility is to blame the entire international community."
"We respect the choices of the Iranian people, and the aim of our criticism is to achieve a better future for the Iranian people."
"We appeal to the European Union's High Representative for foreign affairs and security policy and the Vice-President of the Commission to take a resolute stand in this matter, and to put strong pressure on the UN."
"Mr President, the European Union has a great opportunity to endorse a move to strengthen international law at the next Human Rights Council."
"We have heard long lists of important issues from the Council and the Commission, but do we have any guarantees that the European Union will actually insist that they are addressed?"
"For example, I might mention that the Goldstone report on the breaches of international humanitarian law during the war in Gaza has had a very controversial reception in the Member States."
"In my opinion, we have a right to receive an account from the representative of the Council on how the various Member States now view this important report."
"This report is crucial at a time when we are trying to put an end to seeing all those who are guilty of international humanitarian law violations and war crimes go unpunished and, instead, to bring them to justice."
"Secondly, like my fellow Member, Mr Howitt, I would like to mention the new report on secret detention centres."
"The European Union must take more decisive action on torture and all inhumane treatment in prisons, some of them secret."
"We must also be able to face the fact that the Member States of the European Union are themselves guilty of such things."
"This cannot go on; we also have to investigate these matters inasmuch as they affect us."
"We have an opportunity to boost the power of the International Criminal Court by adopting a forceful position on how the Court's Code of Professional Conduct should be amended this spring."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the Human Rights Council has undoubtedly laudable aims but it is seriously compromised by some of its members."
"Many of them have scant respect for human rights and democracy including Cuba, China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Nicaragua and Gabon - and Iran, as a potential candidate - to name just a few."
"Clearly, therefore, this body has little substantive moral authority."
"It is all the EU has to engage with at UN level and it is nevertheless doing some good work on food security and the rights of the child."
"However, they attack Israel's human rights record obsessively but their own contempt for human rights often escapes scrutiny."
"This Parliament's resolution rightly highlights that the 13th session omits to mention the serious human rights problems associated with regimes like Guinea-Conakry, Afghanistan, Iran and Yemen."
"Secondly, this resolution makes reference to the CIA and extraordinary rendition."
"We should think twice before attacking our American allies when they are still shouldering a vastly disproportionate burden of responsibility for our security in the European Union."
"Mr President, whilst the Commission is very keen on defending our human rights, we British have known since the thirteenth century exactly where we have stood."
"I am afraid to say that the Lisbon Treaty is a pale shadow of our Magna Carta."
"The Commission likes to see itself as a global actor in the area of human nights and seems to be keen to judge others and to offer help and advice."
"However, it should take a critical look at itself."
"I find it deeply ironic that, whilst the EU rightly supports the rights of the Kashmiris who patiently await a referendum on the right to self-determination that they were promised by the United Nations in 1947, the Commission actively seeks to take away competence from its own Member States in the important areas of high policy, via the Lisbon Treaty."
"In fact, this brings me on to the subject of a referendum that was promised to the British electorate but which simply never happened."
"Therefore, my electorate awaits self-determination, along with the Kashmiris."
"(ES) Mr President, I think that this is an excellent opportunity to affirm the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights, which is what this motion for a joint resolution to be adopted tomorrow does."
"Parliament has expressed its opinion on several occasions, normally through the Annual Report on Human Rights in the World, and through various resolutions, as we did recently in the case of Iran."
"Some fellow Members have referred to the paradox - a word that they have used - of certain countries that have an extremely poor record on human rights being part of the body that is responsible for monitoring them, and I think that the case of Iran is one of the most obvious ones."
"This is not the only example, and I think that the United Nations will become ineffective if it is really resourced by these countries, and will lose all political legitimacy and moral authority to condemn these events."
"While I am talking about this, Mr President, this week, another of Parliament's bodies has been considering the expulsion of a member of this House, the expulsion of Cuba."
"In addition, today we must mourn the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year old builder and political prisoner, who has died following a hunger strike and arbitrary, inhumane and cruel imprisonment."
"The Chair of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo SÃ¡nchez, a person who is very close to the spirit of social democracy, has said that this death was entirely avoidable and that he considers it to be a murder dressed up as justice."
"Commissioner, I would like to ask you - as we already know the position of the President-in-Office - if you think, from an ethical and democratic point of view, in response to the deplorable events such as the death of Mr Zapata, and if the Commission thinks, that relations between the European Union and Cuba need to be raised to a higher level and given priority?"
"Welcome"
"I should like to welcome Monsignor Jorge Ortiga, Archbishop of Braga, together with the bishops and the Portuguese episcopal delegation accompanying him."
"Your Grace, may I take this opportunity to express our solidarity and our condolences to the people of Portugal, especially the people of Madeira, who have suffered greatly over the past few days."
"Our thoughts and our prayers are with them."
"Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010) (continuation of debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Parliament's priorities for the UN Human Rights Council (Geneva, 1-26 March 2010)."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council is an extremely important occasion."
"I would simply like to mention one or two cases that are not addressed very often."
"Specifically on the subject of prisons, but not those for terrorists, I would like to point out the truly inhumane conditions of the prisons in Rwanda and in Libya, where totally innocent people held in detention are sentenced to death."
"Furthermore, I would like to mention the issue of the Sahrawi people, which has remained unresolved for so long now, and I would also like to mention the rights of climate refugees who are driven from their countries by dramatic forms of climate change."
"These are all factors that must be taken into account, precisely because they are also the foundations of our society."
"(DE) Mr President, for its 60th birthday in 2005, the United Nations gave itself two new structures."
"The first was the Peacebuilding Commission and the second was the Human Rights Council."
"While the Peacebuilding Commission carries out its work fairly effectively and has largely met expectations, the same cannot be said, with the best will in the world, about the Human Rights Council."
"It has been said here - and expressed in the resolution - that a reform is sorely needed."
"The work of the Human Rights Council is too one-sided - my fellow Members have mentioned this - for example, Israel is discussed from a one-sided perspective."
"To be honest, I am not happy that the only major issue that the Presidency has highlighted here is the Goldstone report, which is certainly worth discussing, but it is not the main issue."
"If Mr Howitt says that the election of Iran - if successful - would be a death blow to the Human Rights Council, then I would like to know what that means."
"I would like a uniform position to be taken on this by our Member States and also by the European External Action Service because I believe that, if things continue in this way, we will need to seriously consider putting the focus of our human rights work in the United Nations back onto the Third Committee, which at least has universal representation and greater legitimacy."
"(NL) You know it, we know it, the UN Human Rights Council is one big farce."
"This Council is being held to ransom by the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which is made up of countries which protect each other and which seek to provoke the fine state of Israel and to falsely accuse it."
"Mr President, this so-called Human Rights Council opposes everything that human rights are about, in particular, freedom of expression."
"It is outrageous and despicable that this Parliament should take this terrible Council seriously."
"Mr President, if this House really does believe in human rights, then it should condemn the steady stream of resolutions which seek to strangle freedom of expression, as well as flagrant human rights violations committed by the countries which make up the Human Rights Council."
"Mr President, in addition to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia and Egypt, who are amongst the gravest violators of human rights in the world, now Iran, too, wants to become a member of the Human Rights Council."
"Well then, we just need North Korea to join the club and we will have pretty much all the rogue states happily sitting alongside each other."
"Mr President, for my party, one thing is clear: the UN Human Rights Council is a dreadful body and one that cannot be taken seriously."
"This House must distance itself immediately and directly from the Human Rights Council and absolutely refuse any dialogue with this bunch of villains."
"(RO) I wish to begin by reminding you that, when it was created as a unique body dedicated to human rights as part of the United Nations system, the Human Rights Council inspired hope, namely, the hope of increasing protection for fundamental rights at a global level."
"The introduction of the Universal Periodic Review mechanism, which is the most important innovation in relation to the now defunct UN Commission on Human Rights, was intended to resolve the relevant problems, the excessive politicisation and selective approach in handling cases of serious human rights violations."
"This mechanism is vital so that the Human Rights Council can fulfil its mandate in whatever way possible."
"However, it must be emphasised that the old demons have not disappeared entirely and excessive politicisation continues to affect the work of this body."
"On the other hand, we must say that the Universal Periodic Review mechanism is not sufficient to ensure effective protection for human rights."
"When the Council does not react with sufficient alacrity, as happened in the case of Guinea, to let me give you just a single example, this has extremely serious consequences."
"This can make the perpetrators of human rights violations simply feel that they have nothing to worry about."
"This Council's credibility depends therefore on its ability to take firm, rapid action when serious human rights violations occur."
"In this respect, it is important for the European Union to promote the creation of mechanisms at Human Rights Council level specifically designed to respond to crises such as those, if we take current examples, in Afghanistan, Guinea Conakry, Iran, Yemen or Iraq."
"I believe that it is in the European Parliament's interest for this body, the Human Rights Council, to be as powerful and effective as possible, because I would say that we need a credible partner in the dialogue on human rights."
"(RO) I would like to talk about the situation in the Gaza Strip which, as you know, is a constant source of concern in terms of respect for human rights, especially after the deterioration in circumstances as a result of the clashes last winter."
"I do not believe that we can measure who has suffered more in this conflict."
"Military actions by both sides have meant that mainly civilians suffer, unfortunately."
"However, in the context of the situation on the ground, it is extremely difficult to differentiate between soldiers and civilians among Palestinians."
"On the other hand, the rocket attacks launched by Hamas have terrorised Israeli civilians."
"I visited the area during the conflict and saw the problems and fears facing both sides."
"I believe that any attempt to pin the blame for the events which have occurred on just one side is at variance with the reality."
"The bloody clashes in the Gaza Strip and the tragic humanitarian consequences are a painful plea for concentrated action in all the hot spots around the globe, in particular, against the causes responsible for making defenceless civilians suffer, and for more extensive and effective involvement by international organisations, with a view to giving impetus to the dialogue for peace."
"This is an area where the European Union has not only the necessary capacity and credibility, but also the duty to take more robust action globally."
"Mr President, one parliamentary priority is also to address an alarming situation where the Human Rights Council's activities have resulted in extreme politicisation."
"It is therefore of utmost importance that the EU member delegations should stand up for the establishment of criteria for becoming a member of the Human Rights Council."
"That applies especially to minimum requirements of cooperation with special procedures, and resisting the use of 'no action' motions which have prevented the adoption of resolutions on certain states who are keen to avoid criticisms of their human rights policies."
"I would like to refer to two other parliamentary priorities."
"Firstly, Belarus."
"Contrary to expectations, the human rights situation has not improved, but is worsening."
"I would like today to stress Mr Milinkevich's message."
"The EU has now got real leverage to put pressure on Lukashenko's regime to make him bring about genuine improvement as a condition for further EU economic aid and cooperation."
"Secondly, I would like to call for support for last week's public address by the 18 Russian human rights activists, including Sakharov Prize winner Kovalev, who are extremely worried about a further clampdown on independent satellite information in the Russian language, which the Kremlin has achieved through applying pressure."
"It is really damaging to the values of the EU to praise human rights advocates like Kovalev and, at the same time, to surrender to Mr Putin's claims that broadcasting alternative information in the Russian language by European satellites is something hostile."
"(RO) I would like to draw your attention during today's debate to the case of Israeli soldier Ghilad Shalit, who was kidnapped in Kerem Shalom in June 2006, aged just 19."
"Last week, I was part of the official European Parliament delegation in Israel and one of the meetings was with Ghilad Shalit's father, Noam Shalit."
"In spite of Articles 13, 23 and 126 of the Geneva Convention on the rights of prisoners of war, Ghilad, who also holds French citizenship, has not had his rights respected in terms of receiving visits from his family and the International Red Cross, receiving humane treatment and having the exact location where he is being held prisoner disclosed."
"I must emphasise that even Article 77 of the Goldstone Commission report, which is otherwise critical of Israel, recommends that Ghilad Shalit should enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Geneva Convention."
"On the other hand, Israel respects the rights of prisoners."
"(HU) At the March session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, the European Union must unequivocally state that the international community cannot keep silent about human rights violations, not only those occurring in developing countries but also the contraventions that may be observed in developed countries."
"The Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 18 December 1992, is equally binding on developing and developed countries, including EU Member States."
"The first paragraph of the Declaration's second article states that persons belonging to national minorities have the right to use their own language, in private and in public, without interference or any form of discrimination."
"At present, this article is often honoured in the breach in EU Member States as well."
"The EU can only be credible if it finds a solution that deals with human rights contraventions within European Union territories in a way that sets an example for the whole world."
"(EL) Mr President, the next two years will be crucial in crystallising the role of the UN in the human rights sector because, as you know, the intergovernmental review of the Human Rights Council will be published in 2011."
"There is a danger, during this period, that the countries to which my fellow members referred and which do not set particular store by this sector, will try to limit the role of the UN."
"I should like to add the following to what has already been said: firstly, as the European Union is - and I trust that it will continue to be - one of the most important factors in terms of the defence of human rights, one of our priorities must be for us to speak internationally with one voice and, where possible, to avoid discord."
"Secondly, we need to step up our cooperation with the United States of America in the defence of human rights."
"Thirdly, and lastly, the European Parliament must - and can - carefully monitor the specific procedures that will follow in terms of the universal periodic examination of the Council, so that there is a real and substantial contribution on our part to the promotion of human rights in all the Member States of the United Nations."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, I would like to draw your attention to point 13 of this resolution on Iran's candidacy in the United Nations Human Rights Council."
"On 15 February, Iran was subjected to a universal periodic review, which reviews the situation regarding the protection and promotion of human rights in the country."
"The Iranian regime asserted that respect for human rights is guaranteed there."
"I would like to underline various facts regarding these assertions by the current regime."
"Only yesterday in Parliament, Mrs Radjavi gave us an overview of the arbitrary arrests and acts of torture inflicted on Iranian women and opponents of the regime."
"We also deplore the political conditions prisoners must endure, and Camp Ashraf has become the symbol of non-respect for human rights."
"My parliamentary colleagues provided several eyewitness accounts during the January part-session."
"Today, we cannot accept Iran becoming a member of the highest authority for the defence of human rights."
"Consequently, I wonder what message we are going to send out to other states that genuinely respect human rights."
"Europe must speak with one voice, demonstrating its consistency, and, as Baroness Ashton said in her statements, let us say that, at this stage, Iran's candidacy is inconceivable."
"(SV) Mr President, as regards our group's joint resolution on the UN Human Rights Council I am particularly pleased about paragraphs 6 and 25, in which we repeat the EU's strong support for country-specific resolutions."
"In those cases where human rights are systematically abused, country-specific resolutions are an incredibly important instrument, both in the Human Rights Council and in the UN General Assembly."
"In many cases where the government of a country has long failed to participate in dialogue or programmes to improve the situation in question, country-specific resolutions represent the only remaining action that the international community can take against these crimes."
"It is not about naming and shaming, as some critics believe; neither is it the case that we in Europe enjoy poking our noses into other countries' internal affairs."
"It is quite simply a matter of signalling that we will not accept a regime's systematic abuses and oppression of its own people."
"It is about showing that we side with liberty, not with oppression."
"That is why it is important that the EU camp continues to defend the existence of country-specific resolutions within the UN system."
"Mr President, the countries of the European Union should put their own houses in order before pointing their fingers at others."
"Many European Union members prosecute and imprison people for non-violent freedom of speech."
"In particular, they seek to make any opposition to immigration a criminal offence."
"Book-burning is alive and well."
"Political parties are banned, as in Belgium, or their ban is sought on invented evidence, as in Germany, or a backdoor ban is sought, as in the United Kingdom, where my own party has been banned, by a court order sought by the government, from accepting new members for an indefinite period."
"It is not enough for countries to call themselves democratic: they must also respect freedom of speech, they must respect freedom of association and they must respect freedom of elections."
"Mr President, I am grateful for the speeches by Members regarding this absolutely essential and crucial issue, which, as I said in my first speech, is one of the core elements of the European Union: defending human rights."
"In this respect, we believe that participation in the United Nations Human Rights Council, including support for the existence of the Council, is a position that must be upheld by the European Union."
"The European Union has always advocated that a Human Rights Council should be established to replace the former Commission, as I said before."
"Furthermore, it has believed that it should be an instrument that can adequately deal with human rights situations worldwide, situations which require the United Nations and its members to take action, adopt a position or make the corresponding declaration."
"In fact, the Presidency of the European Union, the Presidency of the Council, has always systematically taken part in the discussions at the various part-sessions of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the European Union, and this will continue to be the case."
"The Presidency of the Council of the Union will take part in the next part-session of the Human Rights Council on behalf of the Council of the Union."
"Naturally, this is perfectly compatible with the declarations and positions of each of the Member States of the Union and of the European Commission, as another institution of the Union."
"I therefore would like to say that we are in favour of the existence of this body, and in favour of drawing on all of its potential, which, in some cases, is achieved, and in other cases is not: obviously, there are certain situations in which, as a result of the votes that take place, the European Union and its Member States do not achieve all their objectives."
"There are really positive cases, for example, the position on Somalia: there are violations of human rights in that region."
"There are other cases in which the objectives have not been achieved, but the positives always outweigh the negatives."
"I would like to say that we are going to talk about some of the cases of countries that have been mentioned in the various speeches."
"I do wish to talk about the case of Iran, because there have been repeated allusions to the subject of Iran's candidacy."
"As you know, declarations have constantly been made on this subject."
"Here in front of me, I have three declarations made this year alone by the Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, regarding the situation in Iran, condemning and expressing her concern about cases of human rights violations and executions that have taken place in Iran."
"Regarding the question of the candidacy, we first have to say that this is a matter that is currently still one of national competence (the position regarding candidacies of countries to join the Human Rights Council)."
"In any case, the matter of the human rights situation in Iran and the human rights violations, and therefore the question as to whether or not Iran's candidacy for the Human Rights Council will be accepted, must be managed carefully in order not to cause the opposite of the desired effect."
"We therefore understand that the European Union, here, must try to have the most coordinated position possible (which is what is happening at the moment), while respecting national competence and, as I said, exercising caution."
"In short, Mr President, we consider the Human Rights Council to be a place where we must defend the European Union's position, and we think it is the right place to do so."
"Furthermore, our commitment to it has always been to ensure that it does not cause the universal movement defending human rights to take steps backwards, to regress, especially in terms of humanity's achievement, which is considering human rights to be a universal value, a universal value that should be defended over and above borders, traditions and diversity, because it is something that is linked to the very essence of human beings."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much to all Members of Parliament for the recommendations they have conveyed."
"We will make sure that we share these with the High Representative."
"Let me make four points in response to specific questions and comments."
"First, on Iran and the candidacy of Iran: I very much support the view expressed by the Spanish Presidency."
"I can only stress that each and every elected member of the Council is expected to display in practice the highest commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights."
"On the very sad case of the loss of human life in Cuba, the death of Mr Orlando Zapata, I would like to express the condolences of the Commission to his family and strongly condemn the continuous imprisonment of more than 200 political dissidents in Cuba as well as other expressions of disrespect for fundamental human rights."
"The Commission calls upon Cuba to change its policy and to live up to its obligations under international law."
"We will continue to address the human rights issue in the dialogue with Cuba, with the authorities there, and we will use this dialogue as a vehicle to press the issue of human rights."
"On the calls by many for the EU to speak with one voice on human rights issues, the Commission is very strongly in support."
"The fourth point, on Gaza: I think it would be more appropriate to take up this point in the next discussion on the Goldstone report."
"I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 110(4) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I have many reservations about the UNHCR's overall credibility."
"In any case, I hope that the presence of a delegation from the Subcommittee on Human Rights at the next session of the Council will provide the European institutions with an opportunity to raise the urgent issue of Christianophobia."
"We are well aware that we do not need to turn back the clock to find serious cases of anti-Christian persecution: we are not in fact talking about the past, but about the present, and unfortunately, in all likelihood, also about the future, because, every day, from every corner of the globe, we receive worrying, tragic news of Christian believers being attacked, discriminated against and killed."
"We also know that the issue is a sensitive one, and that although it has not been addressed properly up to now, this has happened not only because of the diplomatic balance that the participants have to maintain in meetings such as the UNHCR, but obviously also because of the anti-Christian policy pursued by countries which, whilst they are not exactly enemies of Christianity, do at least traditionally tolerate anti-Christian acts."
"It follows that the EU and this House, on an occasion illuminated by the spotlight of world politics, should promote within the international community a new approach to the issue of Christianophobia, so that it is universally and immediately recognised as a serious violation of human rights and of religious freedom, and so that the community takes action to halt its worrying spread."
"in writing. - I support this resolution which calls, inter alia, on the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Member States to work towards a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the Goldstone report and demands the implementation of its recommendations and accountability for all violations of international law, including alleged war crimes, and urges all sides to conduct investigations that meet international standards of independence, impartiality, transparency, promptness and effectiveness, in line with United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/64/L.11."
"It further stresses that respect for international human rights law and international humanitarian law by all parties and under all circumstances is an essential precondition for achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East."
"The resolution also calls on the EU High Representative and Member States to actively monitor the implementation of recommendations included in the Goldstone report by means of consultation of EU external missions and NGOs in the field and calls for the recommendations and related observations to be included in EU dialogues with all parties, as well as EU positions in multilateral fora."
"Implementation of Goldstone recommendations on Israel/Palestine (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the implementation of Goldstone recommendations on Israel/Palestine."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for the opportunity to speak on this issue of the fact-finding mission, a mission sponsored by the United Nations, on the conflict in Gaza, which took place between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, and is known as the 'Goldstone report'."
"The United Nations took careful note of the statement by its Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, to the Security Council on 21 January 2009, in which he gave his impressions following a visit to Gaza and South Israel just after the hostilities ended."
"In addition, the report that has already been referred to in some of the speeches on the previous item, the Goldstone report, which was published in the middle of September last year, was debated in the 12th Session of the Human Rights Council, from 14 September to 2 October."
"From the very beginning of this conflict, the European Union has insisted that the parties fully respect human rights and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law."
"The European Union made it clear that it would closely monitor the investigations into the accusations and violations of human rights."
"In Geneva, the Swedish Presidency of the Council established the European Union's position in the following way: firstly, the European Union considers the report to be serious, as it contains reports of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including deliberate attacks on civilians."
"Secondly, the European Union stresses the importance of adequate and credible investigations being conducted into the possible violations of international law by the parties to the conflict, in line with international legislation and therefore ensuring that the mission directs its recommendations to both the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"The European Union confirmed its constructive position with regard to the Goldstone report when, in the debate of the United Nations Security Council on 27 January, just one month ago, it highlighted the importance of conducting adequate and credible investigations into the possible violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law."
"I can inform you that, subsequently, on 4 February 2010, a few days ago, the Secretary-General of the United Nations published a report on the application of the United Nations General Assembly's Goldstone Resolution."
"The Secretary-General relayed the responses of Israel, the Palestinian occupied territories and Switzerland, and in his observations, he said that the processes initiated by these three parties were under way and that no opinion could be given on the application of the Resolution by the parties concerned."
"It remains to be seen how this matter is going to be dealt with in the United Nations General Assembly."
"The Spanish Presidency's priority in this respect is to achieve a consensus regarding the Union's position on the draft resolution that the Palestinian authorities want to submit to the United Nations General Assembly at this time."
"We have two objectives: firstly, we want the resolution to be adopted by consensus, and, if not, we want a European Union position to emerge on this that is as integrated as possible."
"In any case, I repeat that the Presidency of the Council endorses what the Goldstone report asked for, which is for credible, investigations to be conducted that are independent of the parties."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I just want to endorse what has been said by the Spanish Presidency."
"Although the EU has not endorsed all the recommendations, it made it clear that it takes the Goldstone report very seriously."
"It has invited all parties of the conflict to launch investigations into alleged violations - caused by parties of the conflict - of international humanitarian law and international human rights law."
"This investigation should be in accordance with international standards."
"So far, the steps taken by Israel, the Palestinian authorities and Hamas fall short of providing tangible results, and yet accountability must be established."
"Therefore, the EU keeps repeating our key message that the parties to the conflict make substantial efforts in conducting independent and credible investigations into the alleged violations."
"Since this directly concerns my responsibilities, it is worth recalling that the Commission provides substantial funding to humanitarian organisations whose projects aim to provide vital assistance and protection to Palestinian civilians."
"The EU will strive to ensure that the appropriate follow-up is given at the Human Rights Council meeting in March and to engage at an early stage in the preparation of a consensual resolution."
"In this context, I would like to state here that on 18 February, the Palestinian Delegation tabled a draft General Assembly resolution further to the United Nations' Secretary-General's report as a follow-up to the Goldstone report."
"The Palestinian side indicated that it is their intention to seek General Assembly action on the resolution on Friday, 26 February, to reiterate the main points of the General Assembly resolution 64/10 of 5 November 2009, and to ask the United Nations' Secretary-General to report again in five months."
"As we sit in this room, Member States and the Commission are in intensive consultations on this issue with the aim of reaching a common position on this resolution."
"May I - very much in support of the Spanish Presidency - end up with the point that it is important to seek a common EU position and avoid the previous three-way split."
"Mr President, Mr LÃ³pez Garrido, Commissioner, I believe that a credible investigation into the violations of international humanitarian law is important and that this is what we must focus on."
"The conclusion needs to be examined, but this applies equally to both parties involved, including to those waging asymmetrical war by firing on Sderot and other towns from a densely populated area, thereby determining the battlefield."
"This is being investigated fairly and no one-sided conclusions will be drawn in this regard."
"This also goes to show that, in the Middle East, but also in other comparable regions, only peaceful solutions will bring lasting results."
"As long as no peaceful solution and no lasting understanding can be found, we will never solve these problems."
"In such cases, full account must also be taken of the security aspects of the State of Israel and these aspects must be taken seriously, including in light of the fact that new rockets are being developed here, which are problematic."
"However, I would also like to point out that it is right to call for an international investigation, although not everything can be investigated within the framework of the Goldstone report."
"This report is intended to deal solely with the occupied territories."
"It has been pointed out that not a single Member State of the European Union voted in favour of the report in the Human Rights Council."
"Some abstained, others voted against it and others - such as the United Kingdom and France - refused to take part in the vote at all."
"We should also take this into account, as the resolution was carried by such 'representatives of human rights and democracy' as Cuba, Nigeria and China."
"We ought to bear this in mind when evaluating this matter."
"We need to stand up for human rights, but not on the basis of this report in order to wage political war against one of the sides."
"In December 2008, Operation 'Cast Lead' in Gaza resulted in around 1 500 deaths, the majority of those killed being women, children and other civilians."
"Families were destroyed, and schools bombed."
"A population was thrown into panic, trapped and unable to escape."
"I was in Gaza during the military operation, with some of my colleagues present here, and we were stunned that such a tragedy could unfold in front of the international community without leading to a huge wave of protest."
"Gaza has not changed since then."
"The destruction remains and the siege continues."
"However, there has been the Goldstone report."
"Mr Brok, what is the difference between the Goldstone report and the resolution that followed?"
"The Goldstone report, this brave report that simply demands that justice be done, is that too much to ask?"
"The pressure today to bring down this report and the discrediting of Judge Goldstone is unbelievable."
"His name is being dragged through the mud; he is being called an anti-Semite, even though Israel is not the only one to have the finger pointed at it in the Goldstone report."
"Fatah and Hamas are not spared criticism."
"However, today I will say quite clearly, and I apologise to my fellow Members, that the Israeli Government is the only one that has established a sort of reign of terror and practised censorship to block any follow-up to the report."
"Mr Lieberman, you are not in this House, but you were here yesterday, and I would like to say to you: there will be no intimidation in this Parliament!"
"We want independent inquiries that are in keeping with international standards, not military tribunals judging their own soldiers."
"Mr Lieberman, I will also say that you are not welcome, not because you represent Israel, but because your racist and xenophobic positions are incompatible with European values."
"No democratic state can dare to break international law without having to justify its actions."
"This Parliament will not allow itself to be intimidated."
"It will simply continue to demand that justice be done, that light be shed on the tragedy of Gaza, not in a fierce way, but in a determined way."
"Today, I implore the Council and the Commission simply to abide by that."
"Light and justice, nothing else."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the Goldstone report tries to fulfil the mandate it was given."
"That mandate is, or was, the following: 'To investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after.'"
"And that is exactly what the Goldstone report has done - although it was not just Mr Goldstone, it was also his two female colleagues."
"They conducted investigations on what happened in Gaza and came up with conclusions that are disturbing to say the least."
"They are extremely disturbing because they find in most of the instances they looked into that breaches of international law and international humanitarian law and breaches of the Geneva Conventions have indeed been committed by the forces of a state that claims to be the sole democratic state in the region."
"That is indeed very disquieting."
"We should not let it pass."
"So when we are called upon to take a position on this report, the question is not whether we are for or against Israel, for or against the Palestinians, for or against Hamas; the question is whether we condone breaches of international law, of international humanitarian law and of the Geneva Conventions, no matter by whom they were committed."
"That is what we need to answer."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, let me say how delighted I am that we are finally discussing the Goldstone report in plenary, because it is a vitally important issue, and to date, the EU has been shamefully absent in these issues."
"It is quite unacceptable that the Council still has not endorsed the recommendations of the Goldstone report."
"The Commission says it is taking it very seriously, but that is not good enough: we want an explicit endorsement."
"The Presidency says that it backs it: well, it should back it publicly and explicitly and make sure that the rest of the Council does as well."
"Against that backdrop, I have to say I am pleased that in Parliament's motion for a resolution on the Human Rights Council, which we will vote on tomorrow, we have two very strong paragraphs calling on the High Representative and on Member States to publicly demand the implementation of the report's recommendations."
"The resolution further calls on them to actively monitor the implementation of the recommendations for consultation of EU external missions and with NGOs in the field, because the evidence we have so far is that neither the Israeli authorities nor Hamas are taking their responsibilities sufficiently seriously."
"In Israel, the investigations into targets and tactics used during Operation Cast Lead have been carried out by army commanders or military police, severely compromising the independence of the findings, and from the Hamas side there is still a failure to address adequately the firing of rockets into southern Israel."
"In the light of these failures, it is clear that the EU should put pressure on the UN Secretary-General to prepare a genuinely independent assessment."
"Finally, given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, I call again on the Council and the High Representative to put far more pressure on Israel to lift the siege which is preventing reconstruction and exacerbating the suffering."
"Mr President, the Goldstone report is exceptionally unbalanced and unfair."
"It comes from the United Nations Human Rights Council, whose members include countries such as Iran, Nicaragua, Somalia and Libya."
"What right do those countries have, where respect for human rights has been reduced to zero, to evaluate Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East?"
"The report comes from a very suspect source which is obsessively ill-disposed towards Israel."
"Out of the 25 resolutions on human rights which the UN Human Rights Council has adopted, as many as 20 are devoted to Israel."
"Not one of them is about the countries which are members of the Council, countries which, and I stress this, have an awful human rights record from women's rights to electoral rights."
"I stress that this report is completely unbalanced."
"It attempts, in fact, to absolve the terrorist activity of Hamas."
"The report does not state the fundamental fact that, in the eight years before Israel, in its own defence, took action in the Gaza Strip, thousands of rockets were fired at innocent Israeli citizens."
"Every country has the right to defend itself against terrorists."
"Israel, too, has that right."
"It should also be said that 150 criminal investigations of the actions of particular Israeli soldiers are currently under way in Israel."
"In Israel, there is a free parliament, and there is a free press which often criticises its own government and its own armed forces."
"None of these features is to be found, unfortunately, on the terrorist side."
"I think, therefore, that this unbalanced and unfair report, which, in my opinion, attacks our main ally in the Middle East in a shameless fashion, should not be taken seriously."
"Mr President, the report by Justice Goldstone provides the most blatant proof of the crimes and of the infringements of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel against the Palestinian people."
"The investigation has given rise to strong indications that the Israeli forces have committed serious infringements of the Fourth Geneva Convention."
"It should be noted that, while the Palestinian side, although criticised in the report, accepts international law and calls for its application, Israel, on the other hand, refuses."
"While certain parties are trying to undermine the report, we call on the Member States of the European Union to stand up for the principles that govern international law and the European Union and to support the debate of the report at the UN General Assembly and its notification to the Security Council with a view to its ultimate ratification and for measures to be taken."
"The report should be sent to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for examination."
"If the European Union is truly interested in resolving the Palestinian problem, then it should stop tolerating these crimes, because tolerance translates into encouragement and complicity."
"Furthermore, based on the conclusions in the report, suspension of action to upgrade relations between the European Union and Israel and the application of the provisions of the association agreement should be examined immediately."
"The people of Palestine and of Israel have every right to a future and to life."
"We have an obligation to exert pressure to achieve a fair solution and peace."
"The Goldstone report should be used to give new impetus, with a view to achieving a fair solution."
"The Goldstone report was very much the focus of attention last week, during the working visit to the Jewish state of the Delegation for relations with Israel."
"The delegation received detailed information about Israel's judicial investigation during and after the military operation in Gaza, from both military and civilian representatives."
"This thorough investigation of their own actions provides a detailed rebuttal of the Goldstone report's damning accusations against the Israeli authorities."
"Moreover, quite apart from the Goldstone report, the IDF, the Israeli armed forces, take any allegation levelled at them seriously and investigate them thoroughly."
"There is a marked contrast here between the IDF and Hamas, the terrorist movement that is to blame for the Gaza operation."
"When have we ever seen Hamas investigate its own actions?"
"Mr President, the available documentation about the Gaza operation leaves us in no doubt about the answer to that."
"Hamas deliberately exposed Palestinian citizens to an acute threat of war, even in places likes mosques."
"In contrast, just consider the intentions and actions of the Israelis, consider the protection of the lives and property of Jewish citizens against Hamas's terrorist rocket attacks, which have been going on for years, as well as Israel's real concern for Palestinian lives."
"Look at all the precautions they took during the operation."
"Mr President, despite the intentions of the Goldstone report, this biased investigation leads to justification on two counts: that of Israel's military operation against Hamas and that of Israel as a democratic state governed by the rule of law."
"You only need to visit the Middle East!"
"(NL) It was clear from the very start that Israel was going to be labelled as perpetrator and aggressor in the Gaza conflict."
"Goldstone and his working methods are endorsed by countries such as Egypt and Pakistan and we know the state of human rights in those countries."
"It is beneath any acceptable standard."
"The report makes no mention of the twelve thousand rockets fired on Israel from Gaza, which posed a very serious threat to the local population."
"Israel was exercising its right of self-defence."
"There is not a single word in the report about Hamas, nor about the fact that they used their citizens as a human shield or that they used civilian buildings in which to store arms and from which to launch rockets."
"Not a word about that."
"Not a word about the fact that the Hamas police force was once part of a military organisation which waged an armed struggle against Israel."
"Mr President, there is only one thing we can do with this Goldstone report and that is to throw it in the bin, and right away, too."
"We should not waste any more time on it."
"This is part of a political process."
"This cannot carry on."
"Put an end to this political persecution of the state of Israel."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, public opinion is divided on the Goldstone report."
"In particular, the Israeli armed forces are accused of having deliberately caused the deaths of countless civilians during the urban guerrilla operations."
"This is a very serious accusation, which appears to overlook certain undeniable facts, such as the distribution of leaflets throughout the battle zone to explain that houses containing weapons and munitions could be hit, and the telephone and radio warnings, including on Hamas frequencies, before attacks were launched on buildings identified as arms depots."
"The so-called 'roof knocking' technique was also used: if, after all those warnings, the air force still identified buildings full of people, small explosive and, above all, loud, charges would be launched to quickly evacuate the buildings."
"The Israeli army introduced warning signals for the Gaza civilians that no one else had put into practice before."
"Anyone who uses all these precautions cannot, under any circumstances, be accused of deliberately targeting civilians."
"Yesterday, on the same day, I met two major political figures: the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs, Avigdor Lieberman, in the morning, and the President of the Palestinian National Authority, Abu Mazen, in the evening."
"In both cases, the meeting was held in a calm and relaxed atmosphere, and the hope expressed that, after too many decades of fighting, weapons will finally be abandoned in favour of a peace process."
"Just as both governments have also requested, Europe must maintain its balanced role as an impartial judge, sheltered from ideological positions that could only further inflame the feelings of both sides."
"Mr President, late last year, you and the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Pillay, came to this Parliament and told us that the Goldstone report into the human rights violations on both sides in the Gaza conflict was thorough, objective and met international standards."
"So let us not try to rubbish this report."
"Let us act on it."
"With others in this debate, I have personally spoken with representatives of the Israeli Government, representatives of the Palestinian Authority and, in Gaza itself, representatives of the commission set up by the de facto authority, to plead with them to cooperate with Goldstone and to undertake their own credible and independent investigations to bring to account those responsible for violations."
"I spoke with the US Assistant Secretary of State, Michael Posner, when he was here, to encourage Israel to do the same."
"To our Spanish Presidency colleague preparing for this Friday's UN vote, I say: do not pursue EU consensus at all costs."
"The idea put forward by some for a unanimous EU abstention would be a travesty for all the victims of this terrible conflict."
"We should negotiate the best text possible, but then I hope more than the five EU States who voted 'yes' last time will vote 'yes', to keep the pressure up."
"This investigation into alleged breaches of international humanitarian law by the Human Rights Council - just as much as the 2004 International Court of Justice ruling on the separation rule - should be treated with the proper status of legal rulings of international treaty bodies that they are."
"I condemn the leader of the Conservative Group in this debate, who has called the UN, a 'suspicious source'."
"It represents the highest aspirations for all of us on this planet and deserves all of our support."
"I would like to say - in a European Union forged from war - for us, war crimes must be held to account."
"So, when the UN Secretary-General reported to the Security Council concerning compliance by Israel and the Palestinians that 'no determination can be made', that cannot be good enough."
"These allegations must be determined, and Europe must show determination that they should."
"(FR) Mr President, the purpose of this debate is not to set ourselves up as prosecutors and judge what we are not qualified to judge."
"Our aim, a twin aim as it happens, is, first of all, to help shed light on the responsibility of the different parties in the Gaza war and, beyond that, looking more to the future, I would say, we must ask ourselves what we can say and do today to help rebuild a dialogue."
"As it happens, I do not think that the Goldstone report is constructive in this regard."
"Furthermore - and it is worth recalling because it is rare - this was the conclusion reached by all the European countries, none of which have supported it in front of the worthy prosecutors and great defenders of freedoms and of human rights that are China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Cuba, to cite just a few examples."
"The report is much debated, it is biased and, whether we like it or not, it will not help us move forward."
"On the other hand, it is up to Israel to choose to assume its responsibilities as a democratic state and to shed full light on the war in Gaza."
"At stake are its military, diplomatic and media interests - those interests that the Hebrew state was able to establish in the past."
"(DE) Mr President, I am pleased that the European Parliament has succeeded in producing a resolution on the Goldstone report that has fairly broad support without simply transferring the conflict in the Middle East to Brussels."
"If we want to retain the chance of lasting peace, we must appeal to what unifies all parties involved, instead of - as some are doing here - emphasising the sources of division."
"The source of unification is the applicability of international law, in particular, with regard to human rights, throughout the world."
"However, just as the parties to the conflict must allow and support an independent investigation, the international community must avoid making a one-sided judgment."
"Therefore, we also need to make it absolutely clear that the one-sided demonising of Israel is not only inappropriate in this debate, but it is inappropriate in general."
"Those powers that are working to call into question the legitimisation of the State of Israel must be clearly repudiated by us in Europe."
"Instead, the powers in Israel that are fighting with us for peace, tolerance and human rights in the Middle East must be strengthened."
"It therefore needs to be made clear here and now that we find the obstruction of the NGOs in Israel by government representatives like the Foreign Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, unacceptable."
"This policy is harmful to the people of Israel and therefore to peace in the Middle East."
"Mr President, the Goldstone report was commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council, which is inundated with Israel's enemies, so you could hardly have expected a balanced analysis."
"The US Congress called the Goldstone report irremediably biased and unworthy of further consideration or legitimacy."
"It fails to mention Hamas terrorism and ignores the fact that Israel is investigating 150 allegations of misconduct by the IDF and will prosecute wrongdoers."
"But behind the controversy about this report lies a human tragedy, the tragedy of the Palestinians who long for moderate and incorrupt leaders who will bring them peace, security and prosperity through a settlement with Israel."
"Neither must we forget the tragedy of civilians in southern Israel, targeted relentlessly by Hamas Jihadi fanatics who hid in their schools or launched their deadly rockets."
"The ECR Group continues to press for a two-state solution as the only way to bring about a long-term sustainable solution to the conflict in the Middle East, but the Goldstone report does nothing to bring us any closer to that point."
"(DE) Mr President, Israel's right to existence, the protection of its people and the efforts to promote as close cooperation with Israel as possible are, for me, as a German and a left-wing politician, political givens."
"However, I find it unacceptable that, for years now, 1.5 million Palestinians have been placed in the largest open-air prison in the world as hostages of a misconceived policy."
"Anyone who is aware that more than 44% of children under the age of 14 live in the Gaza Strip will realise what a dangerous legacy this policy has created for the future."
"Clearly, the 2008 war and the inhumane policy towards civilians are intended to be forgotten."
"For that reason, we call for an investigation and for atonement."
"Taking a relativistic attitude to the violation of humanitarian and international law and granting the perpetrators exemption from punishment will only lead to new suicide attacks and wars, and the spiral of violence will continue."
"Europe must not continue to look away."
"Thus, the implementation of the Goldstone report, including in the United Nations General Assembly, must remain the job of the EU."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the UN Human Rights Council has adopted the Goldstone report by an overwhelming majority."
"Nevertheless, the names of too many of the countries that make up this large majority - China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan - give us pause for thought and make us concerned about its composition."
"We wonder when we read that it is these countries, which do not exactly set an example where human rights are concerned, that are calling for Israel and Hamas to carry out in-depth investigations into the human rights violations committed during 'Operation Cast Lead'."
"We do not intend to side with either of the warring parties, preferring to maintain a balanced judgment, voicing the need to guarantee Israel's security within its borders and the right to exist of the State of Israeli and of the Palestinian State, and stating our opposition to the use of violence, terrorism and war to resolve conflicts."
"Our Christian culture and our conception of mankind and of history give us cause to hope that all the violations committed will be punished in a firm and balanced way."
"(NL) I have said on more than one occasion that, if you do not know or recognise your past, you can never build a future."
"This certainly holds true for the conflict in the Middle East."
"I have heard a lot of criticism here about Mr Goldstone's report."
"I know Mr Goldstone from when he was a great conciliator, carrying out and heading up many investigations in South Africa."
"In my opinion, Mr Goldstone is the prime example of someone who can lay the facts on the table in order to bring conciliation closer."
"Unfortunately, the way in which this report has been received suggests that no conciliation has come about and instead there appears to have been even greater polarisation."
"This is why the report has simply been ignored."
"Mr President, Israel has ignored the conclusions of the report but, at the same time, it has, in fact, recognised that it did make mistakes by paying out compensation to the UN for the damage inflicted and by prosecuting some of its military."
"The Palestinian side, on the other hand, has not taken any such steps."
"I wonder if the Committee of Investigation which has been set up in Ramallah is in a position to carry out a thorough investigation in Gaza at all."
"Mr President, this coming Friday a meeting will take place at the UN and I very much hope that our new foreign policy representative will be able to bring unity and clarity to the European position."
"We have to respect human rights and the rights of both parties under all circumstances."
"Mr President, if we can achieve that unity on Friday, I will be very pleased and then, perhaps, a solution in the Middle East would be within our reach."
"(CS) It is always deceptive to compare numbers which conceal the fate of individual human beings."
"Operation Cast Lead left more than a thousand victims among the inhabitants of Gaza, compared to thirteen victims among the Israeli armed forces."
"Do we need to know any more in order to conclude who is the guilty party and who is the victim in this war?"
"I believe we most definitely do."
"For example, the fact that after 2006, thousands of rockets were fired against civilian populations in Israeli towns from the Gaza strip, and these were launched from densely populated areas and quite clearly from public buildings as well."
"We should ask further questions."
"How can a state defend its citizens in such a situation?"
"Is it possible to fight with an army against terrorists who use civilians as human shields?"
"If so, is it possible to avoid civilians becoming victims?"
"What did the international community do to prevent this form of terrorism?"
"Are there not intentionally varying standards in the area of adherence to human rights?"
"Finding an answer to these serious questions is a challenging task for the common foreign policy of the EU."
"The aim of the policy should be to assist dialogue, build trust and seek patiently for a sustainable peaceful solution for the Middle East as a whole."
"An open-minded enquiry into all of the circumstances accompanying and also preceding the conflict in Gaza might be a step in the right direction."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Goldstone report is destined to remain a milestone of which the full possible future ramifications have perhaps not yet been considered, including as regards the affirmation of international law, to which we liberal democrats are particularly attached."
"We welcome the request made in the report for compensation to be paid to civilian victims of an unequal conflict and for the International Criminal Court to be seized of any cases in which the parties fail to conduct genuinely independent and impartial investigations, as was requested last January by numerous Israeli human rights associations."
"These are facts that may damage even a state such as Israel, which seems to have ceased to draw inspiration from the extraordinary humanism of the great Hebrew culture from which we are all descended."
"The truth is that violence remains a disastrous policy."
"Hezbollah is stronger after the attack on Lebanon, and Hamas is stronger today in Gaza."
"Anyone who has been to Gaza after the conflict can testify to the people's enormous suffering."
"We Europeans must also say today, especially to Gaza: let us stay human!"
"(NL) I think that the Goldstone report has clearly shown that both Israel and Hamas have committed human rights violations during the war in Gaza."
"The UN has already twice called on both parties to carry out independent investigations, but fourteen months later, they are still brushing this call aside."
"I also ask myself why the European Union is not standing up for international law."
"Why does it allow impunity to reign in this region?"
"Any credibility in our respect for international law will be lost if the EU leaves these war crimes unchallenged."
"This report is not about Israel's security."
"This report is about major human rights violations."
"There is therefore no conceivable argument why the recommendations of this report should not be implemented."
"I therefore call, not only on the High Representative, but on Member States as well, to make every effort to ensure a proper follow-up on the ground."
"After all, that is the only way we can give the reestablishment of peace negotiations any chance of success."
"(NL) This report is one-sided."
"It levels a great deal of criticism at Israel because, amongst other reasons, it fired on economic and civilian targets."
"However, Hamas misused these facilities."
"Unfortunately, Mr Goldstone has not seen fit to investigate whether this actually was the case."
"Mr Goldstone has therefore failed to investigate what Hamas did wrong and consequently rapped Israel over the knuckles."
"That inspires no confidence in this report, because there are other sources which suggest that Hamas did indeed entrench itself in hospitals, ambulances and civilian buildings."
"Mr President, I will conclude on a positive note."
"The Goldstone report makes many accusations and they have to be investigated."
"The Israeli Government has rightly taken the initiative in this regard and has launched a criminal investigation."
"That is to be welcomed."
"Yet I fear that we will have to wait a long time for Hamas to show the same level of self-examination."
"(FR) Whether we like it or not, the Goldstone report has been endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, and I do not see why there should be double standards in relation to international law."
"International law is international law, and the Goldstone report uses the term 'war crime', something moreover that was clear for everyone to see on their television screens."
"Even Israeli soldiers have testified that they received orders to shoot at civilians."
"Under these circumstances, the European Union and our Parliament must create the conditions to ensure that the Israeli Government abides by international law, using the suspension of Article 2 of the EU-Israel association agreement as a sanction if necessary."
"This article stipulates that 'relations between the two parties must be based on respect for human rights and respect for democracy'."
"It is that simple; it just needs to be applied."
"The European Union must therefore make clear its determination to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court if nothing is done, in line with the recommendation made in the Goldstone report."
"Finally, our Parliament must decide on a fundamental issue: do we want a harmonious world in which justice and peace ultimately reign supreme, or the law of the jungle that is the politics of might?"
"We must assume our responsibilities to the peoples of Europe and the peoples of the whole world."
"(DA) Mr President, this matter - this report - is a fundamentally embarrassing chapter in the history of the UN."
"Who can, in all decency, discuss the issue of the war in Gaza without also including the thousands of Qassam rockets that rained down over the peaceful citizens of Israel for eight years?"
"Who can, in all decency, discuss this issue without mentioning the hundreds of tunnels that exist between Egypt and Gaza and other areas, through which weapons are smuggled in order to damage Jewish interests in Israel?"
"Who can, in all decency, write a report like this without including the fact that Israel has a well-functioning legal system, whereas not one of the murderers in Palestine and not one of the terrorists in Palestine has ever been brought to account for his crimes?"
"The answer to all three questions is Judge Goldstone."
"This is scandalous!"
"It is embarrassing for the UN system, and by having this debate at all in this Parliament, we are making it an embarrassing affair for the EU, too."
"Mr President, listening to the debate, it is difficult to know what report some of the speakers have read."
"It is certainly not the one I have read."
"Israel denies this Parliament its democratic right to meet Palestinian Legislative Council members in Gaza and denies our Foreign Ministers access."
"A Hamas militant has been murdered, most likely by Israeli agents using forged European passports, thus breaching Irish, British, French, German and Dubai sovereignty."
"Israel is treating us with contempt, which is not surprising given the impunity with which it continues to infringe the rights of millions of Palestinians."
"The acid test of our commitment to human rights and the rule of law is our response to the Goldstone report, which found that the siege of Gaza is collective punishment of the population and that Operation Cast Lead was to further that policy."
"It found evidence of wilful torture, inhumane treatment and wilful causing of great human suffering."
"The report recommends going to the International Criminal Court and that the Quartet should insist on the rule of law."
"I support Goldstone's call on Member State parties to the Geneva Conventions, including Ireland I have to say, to start criminal prosecutions in national courts against the alleged perpetrators of war crimes."
"Could I just make one correction before I conclude, which is that it has been claimed repeatedly that this report does not deal with the firing of rockets into Israel by Hamas."
"However, on page 31, the report mentions the impact on civilians of rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian armed groups on southern Israel."
"(FI) Mr President, as members of the European Union, we need to remember what Europe's values are."
"They are democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion, and we need to adhere to them everywhere."
"The purpose of the Goldstone report was to undertake an unbiased study, but, regrettably, it failed in that."
"That is recognised by all parties who have familiarised themselves with it, and it is also obvious from the report's source material."
"We should also remember that this whole thing was started by countries such as Cuba, Pakistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which do not recognise the same values as the European Union and Israel."
"I am quite shocked by the remarks that Mr De Rossa and Mrs De Keyser made here."
"I wonder just what report you have read."
"If you know, as you do, something about the civil war between Hamas and Fatah, and how much human life has been destroyed in it, then you will agree that we should intervene in the process whereby the Palestinians find leadership and a common voice, and start to build their own country, and not just destroy it, and Israeli democratic society too, by firing rockets at it."
"I would like to say that this report is, unfortunately, a blot in the UN's history."
"We Europeans should also remember that Ghilad Shalit, a European, a Frenchman and an Israeli soldier, is still a prisoner of Hamas, and we must push for his release."
"That is the first step we should be taking."
"Mr President, those of us that are friends of Israel may well have questioned many aspects of the way in which Israel intervened in Gaza, but not the right of Israel to defend herself and to take effective action against those that are planning and executing acts of terrorism against her."
"I have enormous sympathy for the ordinary Palestinian people, but for 60 years, they have been let down by those that claim to lead them and those amongst them whose profession is terrorism."
"It was clear from the start that a report emanating from the dubious Human Rights Council of the UN - and that, Mr Howitt, is what the leader of our group criticised, not the UN; I am afraid your rather petty party point was rather demeaning - would be a one-sided condemnation of Israel."
"While it makes far-reaching demands of Israel, it says little about Hamas."
"It does not call for an end to terrorism and attacks on Israel but merely asks so-called Palestinian armed groups to renounce attacks on Israeli civilians and to try and avoid harm to Palestinian civilians."
"I see nothing in a 554-page report that offers constructive, positive proposals for lasting peace and stability."
"Instead, we find that the rhetoric of human rights and the instruments of the ICC are enlisted to attack Israel, and I have to say such distortion does no credit to the United Nations."
"(DE) Mr President, neither party to the conflict has so far met the demands of the United Nations for a credible and independent investigation into the accusations of the Goldstone report."
"This is regrettable, particularly on Israel's part, because, however controversial the Goldstone report might be, any state that calls itself a democratic state based on the rule of law is obliged to allow such serious accusations to be subjected to an independent investigation."
"An internal military investigation by the Israeli army, which is itself under suspicion, is not sufficient."
"If the EU takes its own principles of respect for human rights and international law seriously, it must increase the pressure on both sides, including in the context of its bilateral relations, and insist that the investigation that has been called for into possible violations of international and humanitarian law is carried out according to the principles of the rule of law."
"War crimes must be punished under international law, as has been said here many times."
"If necessary, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court will have to carry out the investigations on the basis of Article 12(3) of the Rome Statute."
"However, irrespective of the Goldstone report, there is currently no reason to continue the siege on Gaza."
"(SK) The Goldstone report, the conclusions and recommendations of which we are debating, ignores Israel's right to self-defence."
"Last year's intervention by Israel in the Gaza strip was a tough measure and, personally, I feel sorry for the victims and their families."
"We must not forget, however, that it was a final response to years of Palestinian attacks on a densely populated area of Israel."
"Hamas recently announced that it was ready for dialogue with the international community, including the EU and the US."
"I would like to make a strong appeal for us not to entertain such an idea until Hamas unambiguously recognises Israel's right to exist and renounces violence."
"We look with pity on the victims of this long-running conflict, but it is essential to have a reliable Palestinian partner for the peace negotiations, and that means a legitimate, trustworthy and responsible representative of the Palestinian people."
"Until that happens, it will be a waste of time to produce hundreds more pages of international recommendations."
"I would also like to emphasise the role of Egypt, which must act forcefully to prevent any assistance reaching terrorists in the form of weapons smuggled through underground tunnels into Gaza."
"(EL) Mr President, the Goldstone report hits the nail on the head."
"The policy of treating both sides on equal terms is not helping."
"A series of crimes has been carried out and is being carried out in Gaza."
"There is poverty, misery and blatant disrespect for the human rights of the Palestinian people."
"There are witnesses to this."
"There are reports by the Red Cross, the International Bank and the Council of Europe on crimes against the Palestinians, on financial impoverishment and on inhumane living conditions in Gaza."
"We must not turn a blind eye."
"Mankind has been witnessing acts of violence against the Palestinians for several years now."
"The Israeli war machine has been striking out mercilessly on the pretext of self-defence."
"The Palestinian people are suffering."
"We condemn the murder of civilians in Israel also, with all our heart and soul."
"However, that does not mean that Israel is entitled in self-defence to keep committing a barrage of crimes against the Palestinians."
"It does not give Israel an alibi for engaging in such criminal acts."
"Of course we are not public prosecutors, however, nor does the role of Pontius Pilate become us."
"We cannot wash our hands and allow the bloodshed to continue and for Israel's crimes to go unpunished."
"In wishing to be respectful and failing to act, we are allowing unaccountability to rage."
"We are letting the perpetrator go unpunished and are playing fast and loose with the victim."
"We are allowing the law of might is right to prevail."
"(DE) Mr President, the Goldstone report describes human rights violations by both sides."
"Over 1 400 victims in the Gaza Strip are obviously too many."
"However, I am also certain that, without the rocket attacks on Israel, there would have been no military response."
"During a visit to the country by the Delegation to Israel, we discovered that Israel does not take military action lightly."
"The main accusation of the Goldstone report, that Israel deliberately and continually attacked civilians, does not hold water."
"The question of the extent to which Hamas used civilians as shields has not been adequately investigated."
"However, the report mentions that the Israeli army provided warnings by means of telephone calls and flyers."
"Hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on Israel."
"However, we also need to ask whether the UN itself did enough in Gaza, for example, to prevent the Hamas rockets being fired in the vicinity of UN facilities."
"I do not believe that the Goldstone report is a basis for further terrorist attacks on Israel - it does not justify that."
"It perhaps does not help any further, either."
"However, it is clear that, here in the European Parliament, we must demand respect for human rights and call on both sides to return to the peace process."
"(FR) Mr President, in Israel, Judge Goldstone's work is demonised and completely discredited in the eyes of the public."
"At the same time, a violent smear campaign is being conducted against human rights defenders, notably the New Israel Fund, a foundation which funds the main Israeli organisations for the defence of human rights and, in particular, against its president, Naomi Chazan, a former Member of the Knesset, an academic and intellectual known for her commitment to the defence of women's rights and peace."
"Thirteen pacifist groups, such as Bethlehem and Breaking the Silence, are the victims of a veritable witch-hunt."
"The European Union must provide unfailing support to human rights defenders in all countries including, of course, Israel, whose impunity is an insult to democratic values."
"The European Union must protect Israel from its own demons."
"Mr President, there is guilt on both sides, but an overreaction on the part of Israel over this report and indeed over Operation Cast Lead."
"Goldstone is a respected judge of considerable repute, and Jewish."
"There are undoubtedly flaws in this report, but Israel must recognise that the core of the criticism is based on fact."
"You only have to listen to Israeli soldiers who admit to their dubious activities on occasions in the organisation 'Breaking the Silence'."
"Israel has been forced to admit the use of white phosphorous as a result of this inquiry, so why has there been no real investigation into the actions of some of their soldiers who have been involved in potential, if not actual, war crimes?"
"The PLC has admitted its transgressions, but Israel on this issue and on the recent Dubai assassination must cease to be so arrogant and recognise the justified concern of sensible decent people throughout the world."
"Mr President, it seems to me that the three key words in this debate are 'independent', 'equal' and 'neutral'."
"There needs to be an independent investigation into alleged breaches of human rights."
"There has to be equal condemnation of the perpetrators of those breaches and, above all, there is need for a powerful neutral voice to mediate in this unfortunate conflict, something that is sadly lacking at the minute because the position of the vast majority of powerful countries is fairly well known."
"I think there is a wonderful opportunity for the High Representative or the newly created President of the Council to supply that neutral voice, something similar to what George Mitchell did in Northern Ireland, as a result of which we now have peace, and people who were shooting and killing one another for years are now in government together."
"That same opportunity is there for the High Representative to supply that neutral, independent and fair voice that is so sadly lacking."
"Mr President, can I ask Mr Kelly, and I am sure he will be glad to do so, to clarify."
"While the party that I represent in Northern Ireland is certainly in government, my party has been an entirely peaceful party and has not been shooting and killing anybody."
"Rather that has been the IRA and their political representatives."
"Mr President, there has been a debate, which I think has been very diverse, around not only the Goldstone report itself, but also around the prior situation that triggered the report."
"I think that we can say once again on behalf of the Presidency that the Goldstone report is a reference point, as the Council has said, and as Mrs Georgieva has said on behalf of the Commission, and I thank her for her speech."
"It is a reliable report, it appears to be objective and it expresses the existence or possible existence of extremely serious human rights violations originating from different parts of the conflict."
"The European Union cannot remain indifferent in response to the content of the Goldstone report."
"The European Union cannot remain indifferent in response to a report which objectively and reliably relates the possibility of some very serious human rights violations."
"We therefore believe that the proposal arising from this report - which is to conduct independent, credible investigations - is the most appropriate way to respond to the report, which is an important report that should affect all of us."
"It should provoke a reaction in those of us who, as is the case in the European Union and Parliament, believe in the existence of human rights and in defending them."
"It should therefore provoke us to react to the extremely serious human rights violations that have taken place in this case."
"The debate on this report is going to take place, and we believe that this debate in the United Nations should be supported."
"It is also going to be debated in the Human Rights Council."
"We can tell you that the International Criminal Court is working on this and investigating it, and I think that the European Union should therefore maintain a constructive, coordinated position, in relation to the extremely serious matters raised in the Goldstone report, and this is what the Presidency of the Council will do."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first clearly state that the Commission has consistently and forcefully expressed its utmost concern for the humanitarian situation in Gaza."
"My predecessor, Louis Michel, went to Gaza immediately after Operation Cast Lead."
"He eye-witnessed violations on both sides and he spoke up against those."
"We in the Commission are very keen that two issues should always be high on our agenda."
"First: the necessity for full respect of international humanitarian law by all parties; second: the necessity to ensure that humanitarian relief efforts can actually reach the people in Gaza."
"Since the conflict in January last year, the EU has made it clear that we will closely follow investigations into alleged violations of international humanitarian law, and the Commission has underlined and continues to stress the importance of accountability and countering impunity for violations of international law."
"In the context of the Middle East peace process, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law is as important today as ever - and maybe even more important than ever."
"For the EU to be a credible player in the peace process, it is necessary to demonstrate that it applies the EU's fundamental values in all contexts and that it complies with the international-law acquis consistently at any point and on any issue."
"Let me again reiterate in support of the Presidency that a common EU line on the Goldstone issue would be a very important step in this direction."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next sitting."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Goldstone report relating to an extremely controversial situation which stirs up strong passions finds it difficult to obtain the consent of the parties involved when the clashes which occurred in December 2008 and January 2009 between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants in Gaza, an area dominated by Hamas, have caused suffering on both sides."
"Regardless of the parties' position on the Goldstone report, I hope that it will not be used as a pretext to stonewall discussions aimed at resolving the Palestinian problem in a peaceful way for good."
"In fact, the priority in the region is to restart the peace talks which will involve, as has been the case so far, both the European Union and the United States of America."
"The solutions which will be reached must ensure the State of Israel of its continued existence in the region and provide the Palestinians with the guarantee that they will be able to live with dignity in their own viable, democratic and independent state."
"The European Union must be prepared to assume greater responsibility in this process in order to establish normal relations between Israel and Palestine."
"I believe that we must remember the most important point made in the Goldstone report: nothing can justify the suffering of defenceless people, and dialogue is a preferable way of putting an end to this situation rather than confrontation and the use of force."
"On 5 November 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Goldstone report and passed Resolution 64/10."
"These documents called on both Israel and the Palestinians to investigate, within three months, possible human rights violations during the Gaza conflict."
"Unfortunately, neither Israel nor the Palestinians have as yet complied with this request."
"This is a great shame, because the Goldstone report provides a very extensive list of the misdeeds and crimes of both sides."
"According to the report, during the three-week-long attacks, Israel committed major violations of international law."
"Civilians were attacked indiscriminately and houses were bombed."
"The use of phosphorus bombs, condemned by the international community, has also been mentioned."
"The Palestinians, in turn, used rockets and mortar shells to deliberately kill civilians, according to the report."
"The accusations are so serious that it is imperative that they be investigated, and quickly."
"As the UN Security Council has rejected the Goldstone report, it cannot be assumed that the recommendation it contains to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague will be followed."
"I therefore call on the new High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Ashton, on behalf of the EU, to apply a great deal of pressure to both parties to the conflict and ask them to review the crimes."
"Mr President, Justice Goldstone's report is being presented in the international arena as an objective document on the operation in the Gaza Strip in the winter of 2009."
"Meanwhile, according to various sources, it has not been prepared in a way which would allow us refer to it with a clear conscience."
"I would like to mention several features which Ambassador Dore Gold presented during a debate with Mr Goldstone at Brandeis University, and which have been stressed by the Israeli Ministry for Foreign Affairs."
"It seems the members of the mission had been expressing convictions on the conflict even before the mission began, and when they were in the Gaza Strip, they were accompanied by representatives of Hamas and witnesses were interviewed in their presence."
"Justice Goldstone did not show sufficient care when examining the evidence."
"It also seems unjust that the words of the Israeli authorities which are quoted in the report are considered unreliable, whereas the position of the Gaza authorities, such as Hamas, do not give rise to any doubt in the members of the mission."
"In the light of the foregoing criticisms of the Goldstone report, I call on the Commission and the European Parliament to ensure that European public opinion is able to become acquainted with the arguments of both sides concerning the situation in the Gaza Strip."
"The European Union takes care that economic relations with Israel are as good as possible."
"Therefore, it is even more important that we are able to build our relations on mutual trust."
"Reliance on the report of Justice Goldstone alone will not contribute to this."
"Situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus."
"Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the opportunity to speak on this item regarding the situation of civil society and national minorities in Belarus."
"The European Union is certainly very concerned about the deterioration of the situation in Belarus, especially with regard to human rights."
"The lack of freedom of expression and assembly, the constantly increasing pressure on the media, the laws restricting the use of the Internet and the actions against opposition activists are causing the human rights situation in Belarus to deteriorate and worsen."
"In her statement on 16 February, last month, Mrs Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, also expressed her concern regarding the situation of the Polish minority in Belarus, and regarding the detention by the police of some members of that minority."
"This statement, this formal position of the High Representative, was also sent to the authorities in Belarus through official diplomatic channels."
"On Monday, we were able to discuss this matter in the Foreign Affairs Council, and we were able to have a thorough debate that I am sure will be repeated in future."
"There was, incidentally, a speech made by the Polish Minister, who expressed his concern and his feeling that there was a need to react and to take a position regarding the systematic harassment of members of the Polish minority."
"It must also be said that the different facets of the European Union are, without a shadow of a doubt, very concerned, and are monitoring this situation very directly and very closely."
"I think it is very important to convey to the authorities in Belarus that they must comply with the commitments that they have made in the OSCE to respect human rights and to protect minorities as an essential part of respecting human rights."
"In the Foreign Affairs Council that I referred to, there was an express request made to the European Ministers to draw the attention of the authorities in Belarus to this situation through the appropriate channels and in the appropriate forums."
"I think that it is in the common interest of Belarus, the European Union and all Europeans that we manage to have an influence in stopping these actions, which are contrary to human rights and to the rights of minorities, that are very considerable and significant in Belarus."
"At the same time, I think that it is important for Belarus to be working in the right direction, and all of the dimensions of the Eastern Partnership are an opportunity to influence Belarus in the right direction, including the multilateral aspect."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, further to the EU Presidency statement, which actually referred to the position expressed by the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, on the matter very clearly and very forcefully, let me just add the concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus, in particular with regard to the Polish minority."
"The very regrettable backtracking of the advancement of democracy in Belarus in the last years is a very serious matter but, that being said, we must also remain engaged with Belarus and we must keep channels of communication open, however difficult this may be, not necessarily only through government channels - we can, of course, build on the Eastern Partnership and use it - but also through people-to-people contacts."
"Those contacts may be the most important ones to pursue in Belarus, through student exchange, through business opportunities and through providing cultural exchanges as a platform of engagement with the people of Belarus and as a way of retaining an opportunity for advancing democracy in Belarus."
"In closing, let me say that, despite this reversal in the last two years, the Commission would like to remain engaged and pursue, through its interaction with Belarus, acceleration of a positive development bringing the process of engagement back on track, as it was two years ago."
"Mr President, my thanks to the Spanish Presidency and to the Commission for their words on this situation."
"I think we need to be clear about one thing: what we are talking about now is not a single incident - it is the actions of a dictatorship and a brutal regime that is denying minority rights as well as the rights of its individual citizens."
"That is how things are in Belarus, and I think that must be the point of departure for our discussions on the dialogue with the regime."
"A dialogue must be mutual."
"When we show openness, we need to require the regime in Belarus to deliver, and they have not delivered the changes and the reforms that they should deliver."
"I would like to say and underline very much that this is not a Polish issue."
"Belarus is in the neighbourhood of the European Union."
"It is included in the Eastern Partnership."
"This is a European issue and, by its actions now, the regime in Belarus is distancing itself from open dialogue and cooperation with the European Union."
"We shall require, first of all, in a fundamental way, respect for minorities, respect for human rights, a stop to police brutality and a willingness to have a constructive dialogue with the European Union."
"I think this message must be made clear to the regime."
"Our dialogue must be a dialogue for democracy and human rights and, of course, we should turn to civil society because Belarus is much more than the regime."
"It is the people living in Belarus - the students, men and women, society."
"I think what we have seen lately has proved that we must now proceed with a dialogue directed at civil society in order to strengthen freedom and democracy and respect for human rights."
"Mr President, let me, on behalf of the Group of Socialist and Democrats, express our concerns about the human rights situation in Belarus, and particularly with regard to the recent developments with the Union of Poles."
"We would like also to express our solidarity with all the citizens of Belarus who are not able to enjoy their basic civil and human rights."
"This is in a European country in the 21st century."
"I think this is an issue which is not acceptable and we can all agree on that."
"This is the starting point."
"The main questions we have to pose now are, first, where we want to bring Belarus and, second, how we can do it."
"On the first question, I think we can all agree: we want to see Belarus democratic; we want to see Belarusian authorities democratically elected - parliament, president, governments, and local representatives; we want to see these authorities creating a free and creative atmosphere in Belarus; and, of course, we want to see the country moving closer to the EU."
"The second question is how we can achieve this."
"The European Union has changed its policy towards Belarus from isolation to engagement, and it seems that this policy is producing some results."
"Of course, it is not enough, it is not being done quickly enough, and the developments we see, as in the last two weeks, show that we have to be much more committed."
"What I have discovered as chair of the Euronest delegation and chair of the delegation that is going to Belarus tomorrow to see the situation on the ground is that we lack a joint strategy between the three main institutions: Council, Commission and Parliament."
"We need such a strategy in order to reinforce each other's efforts, and we really need a political dialogue; we need a roadmap for Belarus which is very concrete, not just general recommendations but an action plan - a roadmap - which Belarus should adhere to."
"This is the way to continue and it is not enough to do it only under the economic cooperation and the Eastern Partnership."
"(NL) I, too, regard this evening's debate as more of a regional matter."
"We have seen that Mr Yanukovich has been elected in Ukraine."
"He is clearly a president who is looking more to Moscow than to Brussels."
"We must not allow his visit next week to pull the wool over our eyes."
"In my opinion, what is now happening in Belarus and the kind of actions that Mr Lukashenko has dared allow himself to take when it comes to the Polish minority in this country are signs that he also is looking more to Moscow than to the West."
"In so doing, he has evidently felt able to strip a minority of an EU Member State of its fundamental human rights."
"How is this possible?"
"This is, of course, a consequence of Europe having turned its back too much on the East."
"We have not been open enough to the idea of genuine access to these countries."
"Naturally, we must firmly condemn what Belarus is doing to its Polish minority, but we should also relax our policy a little more and operate a less restrictive visa regime."
"Let us look at our energy policy and let us attune it more to countries like Belarus and Ukraine."
"That is the plea I make: that Europe should again turn more of its attention to these countries."
"That will have a much better impact on their internal political developments than if we condemn them too harshly now and leave things to Moscow."
"Mr President, a crucial reason why this subject is now on the agenda is surely the peaceful demonstration in which 40 representatives of the Union of Poles were arrested, which we must naturally condemn."
"Another reason, of topical interest, is something my fellow Member, Mr Vigenin, has already mentioned: after a long, long gap, tomorrow Parliament is sending a factfinding delegation to Minsk, and I am representing the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as one of the four in the party."
"We should be concerned about the human rights situation in Belarus."
"There are problems there to do with freedom of speech, freedom of the media and freedom of assembly and association."
"We must insist that Belarus should abolish the death penalty, and, if relations between Belarus and the European Union are to develop, the country will need to improve the human rights situation there in all its aspects."
"Like others of my fellow Members, I agree that civil society has a vital role to play in this development."
"Mr President, a lack of a decision is also a decision."
"A resolution of the European Parliament on Belarus adopted in March will be necessary, but it is even more necessary now."
"The persecution of Poles in Belarus is not only a matter for Poles, as those who have spoken before me have stressed, but is a symptom of an attitude to European standards, including standards concerning national minorities."
"Europe should draw Belarus out of the sphere of Russian influence, but should also require respect for those values which are the essence of the Union, such as civil liberties, freedom of the press, the rights of national and religious minorities and the right of association."
"If Lukashenko does not understand the language of European values, he will certainly understand the language of sanctions."
"However, not sanctions which hit at Belarusian society - we do not want sanctions like that - but sanctions which make life difficult for politicians and officials responsible for discrimination against Poles and the democratic opposition."
"There is an imbalance in relations between the EU and Belarus: the Union is opening the door for Minsk, but is receiving nothing, basically, in return."
"This one-way street leads nowhere."
"It is time for sanctions of a political nature, albeit temporary ones, even if in the form of the absence of representatives of the Belarusian Parliament from the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly and a return to the blacklist of officials of the Minsk regime who will not be admitted to European Union territory."
"Mr President, as the Co-Chair of the Intergroup for Traditional Minorities, National Communities and Languages, I strongly condemn the actions taken by the Belarusian authorities against the largest Polish minority organisation and the members of the minority community."
"As we hear today, these were mostly elderly people."
"The facts show clear violation of not only minority but also basic human rights."
"These actions prove the undemocratic nature of the political system and we, those MEPs who have witnessed the Communist regimes, clearly recognise the methods."
"Since its establishment, the intergroup consistently has stood up for the rights of national minorities and holds any violation of minority rights to be unacceptable."
"We ask the Commission, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to take concrete steps in order to send a clear message to the Belarusian Government that, without engagement in respecting human rights, including minority rights, sanctioning of the relations between the EU and Belarus is not foreseeable."
"Minority rights as part of human rights cannot be considered an internal matter."
"This issue cannot be considered a Polish-Belarusian internal affair."
"It is an EU matter because, as has been already said, this is about our neighbourhood policy, about our Eastern Partnership."
"So we ask the Commission to send a clear message and take clear steps."
"(PL) Mr President, I thank the Council, and also the Commission, for such a quick reaction."
"This is, indeed, a very good example of our European standards."
"Firstly, allow me to say that there is, really, no ethnic conflict here."
"This is not a Polish-Belarusian or a Belarusian-Polish conflict."
"It is, quite simply, a disregard for human rights and the principles of free speech, and violation of the rights of national minorities."
"It could have happened to any other minority."
"Why has it happened to the Polish minority?"
"It is because it is large, organised and democratic, and because, among others, it has Mr Milinkevich, a winner of the European Parliament prize."
"Therefore, it started with us."
"I would like to ask what we should do."
"I have had the opportunity to speak to Mr Milinkevich and Mrs Borys twice, now."
"They declared: we are loyal citizens of Belarus and do not want any economic sanctions."
"We do not want political sanctions, we want a rapprochement of Belarus and the European Union."
"We want balance, and we want cooperation to be conditional on progress in the process of democratisation of the country."
"We, too, should proceed like this."
"This is why we should open up to the citizens of Belarus, and also make it easier for them to obtain visas."
"Are charges for visas and a visa policy necessary at all?"
"It is good that, tomorrow, our fact-finding mission is going to Belarus."
"Let us await its report, and only then will we decide on further action."
"(PL) Mr President, with the Treaty of Lisbon, we were promised, all of us, much greater effectiveness of European Union foreign policy."
"It quickly turned out that our role in Haiti was delayed and unseen, the European Union-USA Summit was a failure, and creation of the diplomatic corps was conducted in an atmosphere of squabbling between EU institutions which was detrimental to the quality of the corps."
"Today, we had another opportunity to show that the Union can act."
"Unfortunately, the Council has postponed its decision, and Parliament is not capable of reacting to an obvious situation of human rights violations in a country whose role in EU policy was supposed to increase."
"Mrs Georgieva, the policy of open doors and student exchange for Belarus has failed, it has failed today, so please do not repeat the same things about student exchange that we have been hearing for five years."
"This is a defeat which has affected the Union's credibility."
"The European Union is, today, a weak and undecided player."
"Washington knows this, Moscow knows this, and with the ambiguous reactions to the crisis in Belarus, Minsk knows this, too."
"(PL) Mr President, As Chair of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Belarus, I often have contact, not only with representatives of the opposition, civil society and non-governmental organisations, but also with representatives of the official authorities."
"I hear the arguments they use, how Belarus has the right to adopt certain international standards at its own pace."
"Theoretically, the European Union should not put pressure on this responsible, sovereign country, because responsibility for the internal situation in the country is borne by its authorities."
"Theoretically, it would be possible to agree with such a course of action, if not for the fact that in these international standards, which Belarus itself accepted when it joined the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, human rights are not an internal matter."
"As happened recently in Iwieniec, a small town in central Belarus, when the authorities used, and I would say abused, the police force against a group of elderly people, pensioners, led by Teresa Sobol, who had, on her own initiative, raised considerable funds, mainly from abroad."
"She used this money to renovate a ruined building in the town centre."
"She then transformed the building into a vibrant cultural and social centre for the Polish minority."
"The police were sent to these people before a court had ruled on the legal status of the building."
"Next, people called by the activists as witnesses are not being allowed to appear in court to testify and make it a fair trial."
"This is not a pace of adopting international standards."
"This is a departure from international standards, standards to which Belarus has committed itself and which it promises us to respect as part of its dialogue with the European Union."
"Therefore, I would like to say one more thing."
"We can talk about sanctions, and the time will come for this."
"However, it is most important that the economic assistance which is being considered should be conditional upon abandoning this kind of practice and on true, real liberalisation and democratisation in Belarus."
"(LT) Government institutions must immediately resolve conflicts and misunderstandings regarding Polish minority organisations in Belarus and do this democratically, without the use of force or violence."
"I would also like to support the Commissioner's view that we must continue cooperation and maintain people-to-people contacts."
"Tomorrow, the first official European Parliament delegation in many years leaves for Belarus."
"Let us hope for open discussions, both with the opposition and with the government."
"Impressions brought back from Minsk on the conflict mentioned, as well as on Belarus's participation in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, could shift EU relations with Belarus in a better direction."
"The local elections which will take place in two months are an even more important litmus paper, which will open up the prospect for relations."
"This time, these should not be elections without a choice, where the media sings from the same hymn sheet and the opposition has no voice and is ignored, where, after unmonitored vote counting, almost 100% of the voters supported one political party and, in the end, deputies were, to all intents and purposes, appointed, not elected."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Liberadzki of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament began by praising the authorities of the European Union for their reaction."
"It is because of your group, Mr Liberadzki, that we are not adopting the resolution today, so it may be that you really do feel satisfaction."
"However, if Mrs Georgieva, who is, in fact, involved with development every day, is telling us today about what has been proposed, well, I do not know who this might satisfy."
"It may satisfy you, Mr Liberadzki, and it may satisfy your group, but it certainly will not satisfy Belarusians and neither will it satisfy those who wish Belarusians well."
"If even Mrs Georgieva, the Commissioner, who has five minutes available for her speech, uses only two minutes of that valuable time, it means that not only what you said, Mrs Georgieva, is not very satisfactory, but that you did not use the opportunity to speak out clearly on the subject."
"So I call on you, Mrs Georgieva, and also on the authorities of the European Union, to make use of the instruments which are at their disposal to oppose violations of human rights."
"We are not talking only about violations of the rights of citizens of Polish origin; we are talking about violations of human rights."
"(HU) What we have witnessed in the past few days in Belarus is a dreadful example of the political repression of the democratic opposition and the Polish minority."
"Imprisonment of political opponents and intimidation of minority representatives are well-known practices used by authoritarian regimes."
"As a citizen of Slovakia and a representative of a minority, I understand the situation of the Polish minority as well as the plight of Mrs Borys in Belarus."
"The treatment of minorities as enemies and hostages of a neighbouring country is a regressive political manoeuvre usually seized upon by a political leadership when facing difficulties."
"Harassment of national minorities is part of the political practice in undemocratic regimes."
"Minority rights are an integral part of universal human rights, however, as confirmed by the Framework Convention of the Council of Europe."
"Violation of minority rights, harassment, intimidation and discrimination against persons belonging to minorities cannot, therefore, be considered a country's internal matter."
"For that reason, the threatening, blackmailing message of the Belarus Government, conveyed to MEPs by the ambassador of Belarus, is completely unacceptable."
"Mr President, there is only one message the European Parliament can send to the government of Belarus, namely, that its repression of the democratic opposition and policy of threats against a minority are simply unacceptable."
"(PL) Mr President, I listened with great attention to what was said by the Commissioner, Mrs Georgieva, and would like to say that I expect behaviour which is a little more energetic."
"I suspect that Mrs Georgieva's statement would have been the same two weeks ago, before these events."
"This is certainly not acceptable."
"However, there is one thing with which I do agree, only I would expect clear effects and slightly different emphases to be evident."
"It is, indeed, true that those who, today, are arguing for sanctions sometimes forget that sanctions have already been tried, and that Belarusian policy was exactly the same, in spite of the sanctions."
"We must not say, today, that we are going to support civil society in Belarus because someone who has been there knows that, in fact, civil society may be just beginning to appear."
"I expect, today, from European institutions, that the obligations which the state has towards its citizens, and which are not being met in Belarus, will be met for that state by the European Union."
"I would expect that we will help to establish independent media there, that we will support the first free television station which exists there and which has been financed up till now by, I think, the governments of two European countries."
"It is my expectation that we will be able to create real possibilities for large numbers of Belarusian citizens to study in Europe, because it is they who make up civil society."
"(PL) Mr President, in the previous term, the European Parliament adopted several resolutions on Belarus, in which, accurately diagnosing the situation, it called upon the Lukashenko regime to stop violating human rights."
"The European Union has shown good will, partially lifting visa sanctions against Belarusian officials."
"It is with surprise and anxiety that we have observed the recent aggressive policy of the Belarusian authorities towards national minorities, especially the Polish community."
"This policy should be seen in the context of preparations for the elections to be held in Belarus next year."
"The illegal seizure of property belonging to the Polish minority, and the ostentatious repression of opposition leaders, who, it should be noted, were awarded the Sakharov Prize by the European Parliament, is a manifest provocation of our institution."
"Our House should not only react in the traditional fashion with an appropriate resolution, but should take specific action to discipline the Belarusian authorities and should appeal to Mrs Ashton to appoint, on the basis of Article 33 of the Treaty of Lisbon, a special representative to monitor breaches of human rights in Belarus."
"(PL) Mr President, Mrs Georgieva, it is very good that we are talking about Belarus here in the European Parliament, but talking is not enough."
"Today, the European Union - and this is what I would expect from the European Commission - should prepare a strategic plan for supporting the democratic opposition, for supporting civil society and non-governmental organisations, and for supporting free media."
"We are talking, today, about matters such as democracy and human rights, which are something natural for us and are what Europe is built on."
"Belarusian society is mostly made up of people who can only dream about values like this."
"Therefore, we expect the European Commission to develop a strategic plan to help civil society."
"Mr President, following these speeches, I can only agree with the condemnation that has been expressed by Members regarding the human rights violations taking place in Belarus which, in this specific case, are affecting a minority, the Polish minority in that country."
"They therefore affect the European Union, not only because they concern a minority that has a national reference point in a European Union country, but also because what we are talking about is a serious violation of the human rights of minorities, and therefore our attitude would be exactly the same whether it was a Polish minority or another minority."
"We are talking about a violation of human rights, which we have said are universal rights, and so this is not an issue that strictly requires a reaction from the European Union simply because in this case it concerns a Polish minority."
"We should say exactly the same thing if a different minority were involved, because all human rights are indivisible and universal."
"I would like to say that the fact that a regime makes mistakes and violates human rights should not mean that its citizens are punished."
"We therefore believe that it is important for Belarus to be in the Eastern Partnership."
"What Commissioner Georgieva said to us about 'people-to-people contacts' is important."
"All of this is important, and it is, of course, equally important, as many of you have said, to constantly, clearly and directly convey to the Belarusian authorities our entirely critical and condemning attitude to the human rights violations."
"This is, incidentally, what the High Representative, Mrs Ashton, is resolved to do, as she is monitoring this matter in close contact with President Buzek, who is currently chairing the debate."
"She is also going to use the opportunity of attending the forthcoming investiture of Mr Yanukovich in Kiev, which it is presumed will be attended by Mr Lukashenko, to tackle this issue, which will continue to be discussed in future by the European Union's Foreign Affairs Council, because it is a very important matter."
"I am therefore very glad that today, it has been possible to debate it immediately in Parliament, in this House."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first thank Members for the discussion in this House, and make four points."
"My first point is that respect for human rights is categorically a cornerstone of external relations of the European Union, and it is the foundation on which engagement with any country, including Belarus, is built."
"Second, the deterioration of democracy in Belarus had a very unfortunate low point recently, but it did not start last week."
"It started around mid-2009, and this led the EU Council of Ministers in November 2009 to request that the Commission formulate a proposal for the so-called 'joint interim plan' in support of reforms to be implemented with Belarus."
"The Commission's services have prepared a draft of this joint interim plan for reforms."
"It is now with the High Representative, and the High Representative certainly would gladly take into account the recommendations coming out of the fact-finding mission that Parliament is starting tomorrow."
"My third point is that it would be with this last event in mind when the High Representative turns back to the services with feedback on this joint interim plan, that it would be finalised."
"Let me make my fourth and last point."
"In the second half of the 1980s, perestroika started in the former Soviet Union, and it led to, for the first time in the lives of many - mine included - an opportunity to compete for student and professional exchanges."
"In my case, it led me to the London School of Economics."
"It dramatically changed my professional life."
"It certainly made me much more helpful, more useful, to my own country."
"It is with this strong belief that it is by opening up the democratic channels for countries under oppressive regimes that we as Europeans can help these countries that I made - and again would repeat - my point on the importance and usefulness of people-to-people contacts, the usefulness of support for businesses, the usefulness - despite the great difficulties, the very unfortunate disrespect for minorities, which we condemn - of remaining engaged in a way that would lift up the chances of the Belarusian people to take the road to a free world and to be connected with the Union, and I would repeat the call for us to remain engaged in that way."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the next monthly session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The Republic of Belarus is one of the European States for which involvement in the European Union's Eastern Partnership marks an important step forward in the development of bilateral relations, as well as in the relations between Belarus and every EU Member State."
"In regarding this partnership as a positive instrument for bringing about change in the Republic of Belarus, consideration must also be given in this mechanism to the position of civil society in this country because of the important role played by civil society in the operation of the rule of law."
"In particular, civil society maintains the transparency of the Partnership mechanism, helping to reinforce cooperation between Belarus and the EU."
"In addition, civil society must be guaranteed participation in all key processes as part of the Partnership (platforms, committees etc.), as well as public control of these processes."
"Belarusian civil society must be able to participate in drawing up the public agenda, which will lead to social, economic and democratic progress in Belarus."
"This is why frequent meetings between representatives of civil society and the government must be encouraged."
"The repression which has recently been used against activists of the Polish minority in Belarus is part of a much wider problem."
"The Belarusian authorities do not tolerate any independence."
"They do not want, and they do not accept, the idea of civil society."
"Every manifestation of independence is treated as political opposition."
"This is not, therefore, an internal conflict in a non-governmental organisation, and neither is it a Polish-Belarusian conflict."
"It is, rather, an expression of the consistent stance of the Belarusian authorities, which are attempting to prevent liberalisation and democratisation."
"It is a pity that in Poland, there are political forces which are trying to use the situation to achieve their own, particular goals, and are using events in Belarus to discredit the policy of the Polish Government."
"Politicians who behave in this way surely do not understand that they are doing exactly what Lukashenko expects."
"It is in his interests to polarise and divide public opinion in Poland and Europe."
"Repudiation of Polish and European policy towards Belarus is an abuse of freedom, and is detrimental to the effectiveness of joint action for freedom and democracy in Belarus. Thank you very much."
"Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the following:"
"oral question to the Council: Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality, by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0007/2010), and"
"oral question to the Commission: Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality, by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0008/2010)."
"The issue of women's rights is always high on my agenda, and therefore I am particularly pleased when they are also a focus of our discussions here in plenary, as today."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has adopted a resolution that represents Parliament's position as regards the Beijing platform."
"I would like to thank our colleagues on the committee very much for their good cooperation."
"The platform adopted in 1995 within the framework of the United Nations was an historically important step."
"The Platform for Action adopted was the first global document of its type. It took an overall view of women's conditions and rights."
"The UN has a long and proud tradition in the area of human rights and adopted a declaration as far back as 1948."
"The Universal Declaration comprises 30 articles and they are often cited."
"This Declaration already stated - in Article 2 - that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms without distinction of any kind, and sex is expressly mentioned."
"Within the EU, the issue of equality between women and men has a clear basis both in the treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The committee was united on the importance of the Beijing platform and the need to work more specifically within the EU on systematically monitoring developments and ensuring that we move towards increased equality in every area."
"The new European Institute for Gender Equality, based in Vilnius, will be a way for us to obtain assistance with this work and will also be able to provide research to show which political measures are most effective, for there are many areas in which we do not have the necessary facts or knowledge."
"I support the proposal for a European Protection Order, which I am very pleased that the Spanish Presidency has tabled."
"The Beijing platform contains a number of areas that are incredibly important if we are to make progress."
"These are areas such as poverty which, first and foremost, affects women, inadequate access to health care for women, violence against women in all its forms, and inequality in economic structures and in economic policy."
"As you are aware, a delegation of eight MEPs is to travel to New York to represent the European Parliament."
"We will follow the discussions and negotiations that form part of the assessment of how far the world has come in 15 years towards achieving the objectives of the platform."
"We will take the resolution that we are adopting tomorrow with us to New York, and it is important for us to have it with us."
"The Committee adopted one paragraph stating that sexual and reproductive health and sexual and reproductive rights are part of women's rights and that these need to be improved in Europe and globally."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has requested a separate vote on this paragraph."
"We all know that when people want to vote separately on a paragraph, it is because it is particularly important, and that is why they do not want it voted on in a block with the rest of the resolution."
"I entirely agree with the PPE Group that paragraph 9 is central."
"However, I fear that they want to vote down this paragraph, which I feel would be deeply regrettable."
"I am fully aware that the Members of this Parliament have differing views and values, and that is only right."
"That is why we debate and discuss."
"This wording is a minimum, however, and should be able to be supported by everyone."
"No other wording has been proposed to replace paragraph 9."
"It would be most unfortunate if we went to New York with a resolution that does not even state the minimum on this fundamental issue, which is, after all, an extremely central issue at global level."
"I hope and believe that everyone can accept the wording as it stands, because it only states what is self-evident to all of us."
"In the process, we also worked closely with thousands of different women and women's organisations, giving this document a unique basis."
"Mrs Svensson, thank you very much for your question, because you know that one of the key, central and priority issues for the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union is gender equality."
"The Presidency has a series of objectives expressing this idea of equality in terms of the importance of the non-discrimination directive, and also in relation to something that you mentioned, which is combating gender violence and the importance of having an order to protect the victims of gender violence."
"In this respect, I am very happy to see Commissioner Reding here, who is responsible for implementing everything relating to equality between men and women from a judicial point of view."
"I would also like to start by apologising that the Spanish Minister for Equality is not here, as she has just attended a vote in the Spanish Senate on the reform of the abortion law, which, incidentally, had a good outcome, as it has just been adopted this afternoon in the Spanish Parliament."
"The Council of the European Union has always approved and has always been behind the Union and the United Nations in the area of gender equality."
"The Swedish Presidency produced the Beijing +15 report, which the Spanish Presidency is going to present to the 54th session of the Commission on the Status of Women, and it must be said that although a great deal of progress has been made in this area, there is still a lot to be done."
"In this respect, the Presidency has highlighted, for example, the need to improve the data and to make better use of the indicators that we created at the Beijing Platform."
"As you know, there are 12 indicators produced within the European Union for monitoring, assessing and evaluating actual gender equality, although in some cases, we have still not succeeded in designing them, for example, in the areas of human rights, the media and the environment."
"I would like to say that the Spanish Presidency is going to hold a technical meeting in May to discuss women, the media and stereotypes, as a subject relating to the media, which is also something that falls under the remit of Commissioner Reding."
"I would like to conclude by saying that there is a very important issue at the moment, as everyone knows, which is the economic crisis."
"As well as the damage that is being done, it could also be an obstacle to the progress of equality between men and women."
"It is, however, also true that paradoxically, gender equality could help us to overcome and combat the crisis: through gender equality and equal access to jobs for men and women."
"I am talking very specifically about the Europe 2020 strategy."
"The European Union institutions have made it clear that they want the Europe 2020 strategy to have a gender equality dimension right across the strategy, so that the issue of equality between men and women is also part of the strategy."
"In its report last year, the European Parliament asked the Council and the Commission to include a chapter on integrating the gender dimension in the 2020 strategy."
"The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 30 November last year, the informal EPSCO Council, the one that has just taken place in Barcelona, also said that the Member States and the Commission must work to ensure that, in accordance with their competence, the gender dimension can be consolidated in the 2020 strategy, and that all the relevant political fields are taken into account."
"I am therefore sure that this, along with the Commission's programme of work, a major programme of work that has always been a fundamental instrument for guiding this strategy, is going to mean that this aspect is included in the document which the Commission has promised us for 3 March on the 2020 strategy (which has been mentioned by President Van Rompuy and the President of the Commission, JosÃ© Manuel Barroso)."
"We need to keep on working, we need to keep driving gender equality policies forward."
"It is not only an issue of justice, but an issue of consistency with the spirit of the European Union, so that it can continue to be a reference point in the world for equality between men and women."
"Mr President, for me it is an honour that my first speech during Question Time in Parliament is an answer to questions concerning women."
"Indeed, as Commissioner for Fundamental Rights, I think that the subject of fundamental rights linked to equal treatment between men and women is one of the most important and also one of the oldest."
"Furthermore, I recall with great emotion how, more than 15 years ago, as a young Luxembourg MEP, I prepared the Beijing Platform for Action in Luxembourg; now, here we are in the European Parliament to prepare the follow-up to the Beijing Platform for Action."
"We have come full circle."
"I do not need to underline that; as you know, equality between men and women is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, and you can count on the unfailing commitment of the Commission in this area."
"In the course of this year, I will present a new Commission strategy for gender equality, which will be a follow-up to the existing Roadmap for equality 2006-2010."
"In a few days' time, when the work of the 54th Commission on the Status of Women begins at the United Nations, marking the 15th anniversary of Beijing, the European Parliament will send a very important delegation."
"I myself will be present there, along with the President of the Council, and this will be a first."
"We will both take the floor during the plenary session."
"I think that this, too, is a very strong symbol."
"It will also be an opportunity to gauge, at international level, the progress made in the 12 areas for action which were identified in Beijing, but also to see what inequalities persist, because even though there have been successes, there are still challenges to meet."
"Furthermore, I must say that the European Union is and will remain an important supporter of the work of the United Nations, concerning both the ongoing reform of the institutional mechanisms and the creation of this gender entity within the United Nations."
"The European Union also represents an influential supporter in development terms, in particular, in the context of the Millennium Development Goals, which ensure an important place for 50% of the citizens who contribute to this development globally."
"Indeed, we know very well that without the contribution of women, there will be no development."
"That is why equal treatment between men and women is a horizontal policy in the Commission, conducted not just by the Commissioner responsible for this area, but also by other Commissioners in their own areas of responsibility, namely the areas concerning policies within the European Union as well as its external policies and, in particular, its cooperation and development policies."
"We all know that the creation of the Beijing Platform for Action represented a major step forward."
"Following the adoption of this platform, gender mainstreaming became widespread throughout the European Union."
"That was the signal sent out in Beijing."
"The impact has been truly remarkable given that, in all our Member States, our equality policies are no longer confined to targeted actions, but are, from now on, integrated into all relevant policies."
"The Beijing Platform for Action has also enabled us to follow progress made in relation to equality on the basis of indicators developed by Council for most of the areas of action."
"There are 12 actions and nine indicators."
"We are very proud of the results, but there are still three indicators to establish, which I think the Council is committed to doing by adopting conclusions to forge ahead and develop these outstanding indicators."
"The 15th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action."
"The Swedish Presidency has taken stock of what has been done in the EU with regard to equality."
"The Council has adopted some conclusions, and Parliament will present these papers, which will, of course, also find their place in all the other policies that the European Union will develop."
"Both Presidents have just expressed their opinions on Europe 2020."
"It is only natural that in this system, which is going to get Europe moving again, women will play a special role, especially at a time when fewer and fewer people are in employment."
"In fact, we no longer even have a choice: we need women for economic development."
"It is no longer even just a question of gender equality; it is a question of economic policy, and that alone."
"We therefore have no other choice in the matter."
"We need women if we want Europe to overcome its difficulties, and these new indicators will, of course, help us in this way."
"Within the high level group, we have developed a work programme that will enable us to monitor existing indicators and create indicators that still need to be implemented."
"Naturally, we will be assisted in this task by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which, from next week - and this is another symbol, which comes at exactly the same time as the meeting is being held in New York - will be established permanently in Vilnius."
"Mr President, on my return from New York, I will visit you to discuss the Commission's strategy on equality."
"We will do it together."
"We will do it for 50% of our population, for 50% of our citizens, and we will succeed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the World Conference on Women next week in New York will give us the opportunity to bring the equality of men and women to the attention of society worldwide."
"In so doing, we will certainly subject our current position with regard to what we have achieved and what we still want to achieve to close critical examination."
"The call for equality, development and peace at the World Conference on Women that took place on 15 June 1995 in Beijing is still a concrete statement of our goals today, including in Europe."
"We are on our way, with the goal firmly in view."
"However, we have to admit that the road is not an easy one, that there are traffic jams, blockages and sometimes even one-way streets along the way."
"We constantly need to redefine the route, always keeping the destination firmly in sight."
"There is an old German saying: many roads lead to Rome."
"During the search for the right common path, I therefore invite us all to find more common ground."
"Gender equality policy cannot and must not be a subject for voting on and for narrow, enforced majorities."
"My group grants the freedom to decide on this matter, and therefore, Mrs Svensson, we would like a split vote."
"Equality needs to become a way of thinking."
"This requires sensitivity and it requires the power of persuasion."
"In her resolution, Mrs Svensson has touched many open wounds."
"There are still many unfinished matters that need to be addressed and they have been mentioned: no stereotypical thinking, equal pay for equal work, poverty among women, violence against women and the ageing society, which affects women in particular."
"For us, these are the absolutely key issues in this resolution that we want to address."
"Mere declarations of intent are of little help."
"The list of the many resolutions, strategies and pacts alone takes up two pages of Mrs Svensson's report."
"It is very important to my group that, whenever we talk about equality, both men and women are mentioned - on equal terms, so to speak - and we hope that the follow-up conference to Beijing will also result in us progressing a step further towards greater equality."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, in 2010, we mark the 15th anniversary of the launch of the Beijing Platform for Action."
"This is a moment of reflection where we need not only to evaluate what we have achieved so far but also to think about new ways of attaining the goals set out in 1995."
"The beginning was reassuring: in 1995, a global consensus was reached according to which women and men were equal from all points of view, including political, economic, legal and social."
"However, despite this consensus, the sequel is less stirring."
"Many of the goals of the Beijing Platform for Action are still far from being reached."
"In many countries, women are still not sufficiently empowered and poverty has a feminine face."
"Moreover, even in the 21st century, even in developed countries, we notice again debate on some basic issues, questioning already-established rights such as sexual and reproductive health rights."
"I am very happy that the European Parliament is not following such trends but, on the contrary, committing itself to these basic rights."
"Nevertheless, the political debates, the conservative attacks on human rights are alarming and they clearly underline the fact that the fight for women's rights is far from over."
"I do not think that human rights can be subject to compromise."
"We must not put up with the lowest common denominator."
"Therefore, when we go to New York in a few days' time, we have to make efforts so that all women have the same rights and that these rights are protected."
"I will personally do this under the motto 'My body, my right', which we have to convey to all the women of the world."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, looking back at what has been achieved since the adoption of the declaration and Platform for Action in Beijing 15 years ago, one cannot deny that a lot remains to be done."
"We are still far from Beijing's strategic objectives."
"Inequality and gender stereotypes persist in all the world's regions, including the European Union."
"If we want to make progress on this agenda it is crucial to have, at national and EU level, reliable and comparable data on the Beijing indicators."
"We then also need to make sure these indicators are monitored in a timely fashion in order to update our EU strategy on gender equality accordingly."
"Here in Europe we still have a lot to address."
"Let us take the situation in the labour market: we need to fill the gender pay gap while also looking at the place and the representation of women in leadership positions in both public and private organisations."
"Going more deeply into social considerations, inequalities and discrimination affecting women lead to exclusion and poverty most of the time."
"Poverty is the greatest single determinant of health."
"The feminisation of poverty has a real impact on the physical and mental health of women."
"Minority women are experiencing poverty, exclusion and discrimination."
"Their needs are largely unknown and ignored and their voices are not heard."
"For Roma women, life expectancy can be up to 10 years less than those of the majority."
"Infant mortality is three to four times greater than the majority population."
"Discrimination, exclusion and poverty also need to be considered in the light of the ageing population."
"The differences in life expectancy between men and women will entail increased economic and social difficulties for single elderly women."
"This is the new rising phenomenon and a serious one which has to be closely looked at and properly addressed."
"Finally, Madam Commissioner, I would like to strongly encourage you to come up with a directive on violence against women."
"All of us will be behind you."
"Back in 2006, the UN acknowledged that the most vulnerable populations and the poorest populations were the main victims of climate change."
"The fact is, women form the majority in both categories."
"In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, although women are already discriminated against in terms of access to and control of land, the increasing scarcity of cultivable soil due to drought reduces their means of existence even further."
"A recent report forecasts that in 2050, a billion people will have fled from hostile environments."
"The loss of security of these climate migrants, forced to take refuge in makeshift camps, raises the level of threat against women."
"However, we have to admit that in the last 15 years, not one European legislative text on the environment has included the aspect of gender."
"On behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I therefore call on the European Union and its Member States to integrate the perspective of equality between women and men in all impact assessments, legislation and policies regarding the environment."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, it is just under 100 years since all women were given the right to vote in the United Kingdom."
"Fighting for women's rights is not a new phenomenon, and I want to pay tribute to all the women's organisations round the world that are still fighting for equality between men and women."
"Women want to be able to make independent choices about their careers or their family aspirations: the choice to work in a traditionally male occupation or, equally, the choice to look after children and work in the home."
"What we really need to do is empower women."
"We as Conservatives believe in choice and, with choice, flexibility for women and subsequently equality."
"Are we unintentionally making women less employable by demanding that businesses offer rights that they cannot deliver in today's economic climate?"
"Equally, do we put women off staying at home with children because we as a society value this less than the workplace?"
"The Commissioner rightly said that we need to get women out of the recession and back working."
"I say we also need to secure jobs in small businesses, and this will help us achieve this goal."
"Through over-legislation, we are risking the demise of small businesses, thus, in turn, limiting the very choices we are fighting to give women and, consequently, the equality they deserve."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Swedish Presidency's report on Beijing, there is no reference whatsoever to the situation of non-Western women in Europe."
"Therefore, either the problem does not exist or we do not want to see it."
"However, the situation of Muslim women in the world today, including in Europe, is tragic."
"If Western feminism is having an identity crisis, it is because the fashion for multiculturalism has led so many of us to avoid tackling these issues, which are at the heart of the battles faced by so many Muslim women in Europe and the world."
"Let us leave multiculturalism and political correctness where we found them and let us rise to the new challenge: European men and women must now, not later, support Muslim women in Europe in their battle for emancipation, and thus also help those movements in the world that speak out against Islamic fundamentalism."
"Are we willing to fight to ensure that women in Europe are free from the symbol of spiritual death that is the burkha?"
"Are we ready to discuss the deteriorating conditions of women in Muslim communities in Europe?"
"If the spirit of debate on these issues prevails over silence, then we will also have the strength to support the cause of liberating women in the world from Islamic oppression."
"(HU) 15 years after the adoption of the Beijing Platform we could and should obviously talk about a lot of things."
"Yet I would rather talk about that which is our task."
"We have one tool in our hands, and that is lawmaking."
"Many things have happened during these 15 years, in Member States as well as at EU level; great steps have been taken, mainly as a result of the adoption of anti-discriminatory laws."
"This represented a significant step forward towards bringing about equal opportunities."
"Admittedly, we cannot be satisfied with Community legislation, or often even with that of Member States, as we often see proof of how ineffective these regulations remain."
"Often the situation changes very little after the laws come into force."
"As an example, we can cite the wage gap between women and men."
"For more than 30 years, the law has prohibited gender discrimination, yet these differences have scarcely changed in the last 10 years, occasionally even showing an upward trend."
"Access to these rights is a particular problem, since legal redress is often extremely expensive and complicated."
"Authorities responsible for enforcing equal treatment, charged with the oversight of anti-discrimination legislation in Member States, are generally poorly equipped and, due to a lack of resources, their competence is often limited to the provision of information and advice."
"Hopefully, this year we will also get a chance to look into the effectiveness of the laws we formulate and adopt here."
"It is evident that not everything can be solved by legislative means."
"Stereotypes are difficult to change, yet we have to recognise that the effectiveness of our laws stand or fall on whether we succeed in doing so."
"One sentence by way of conclusion: from time to time, it is certainly worth looking back at the road we have covered, but we also have to see clearly where we are headed."
"We pin great hopes on the reformulated 2020 strategy as well as on the reformulation of the equal opportunity strategy."
"(PT) I very much enjoyed listening to you."
"You have given us positive messages and confirmed your willingness to act."
"Indeed, there needs to be a lot of action because, 15 years after Beijing, we can see that, unfortunately, the results are still of very little significance."
"It is not only the face of poverty which continues to be female, but also the face of illiteracy, unemployment and low wage rates."
"Discrimination in access to education and health care continue to exist."
"Women are the principal victims of trafficking and physical, sexual and psychological violence."
"Women are under-represented in politics and on the boards of companies or, put another way, they are excluded from political and economic decision making."
"We also know that in order for equality policies to be adequate and effective, diagnosis needs to be reliable, based on comparable statistical data which is disaggregated by gender."
"That is what we need in order to be able to make the correct diagnosis and then implement the correct measures."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to say that I did not come to Parliament to applaud the brand new law in Spain on abortion."
"What I am concerned about is human life, and I am particularly concerned about the women - who I am here to defend - whose lives are in danger as a result of gender violence, and I am here to offer them a space in which they can live freely and safely."
"Parliament's Resolution of 2 February 2006 recommended that the Member States adopt an attitude of zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women, and that they adopt the necessary measures to ensure better protection for victims."
"The Stockholm Programme, which was adopted in this House, established an area of freedom, justice and security for all European citizens, and combating gender violence was considered to be a priority in that programme."
"This reflected my request for the Spanish Presidency to promote a European protection order for the victims of gender violence during its mandate, to ensure that the victims of these crimes have the same level of protection in all the Member States."
"In a Europe without borders, the fight against gender violence should also be without borders, and the Member States should work hard to harmonise their legislation so that the fight against ill-treatment of women overcomes the legislative obstacles in its way and we can finally protect the lives of women and their children, at least within the European Union,"
"I therefore ask the Commission and the Council to do everything that is necessary and everything in their power to move forward with the European protection order for victims, which is a very effective instrument for ensuring that those who fail to respect the dignity of women and their right to live freely and safely do not go unpunished."
"(ES) Mr President, ... (beginning of speech not available for technical reasons) ..."
"30 000 women joined their voices, their ideas and their plans for moving forward in a fairer and more equal society."
"They came from different places, from a vast number of ideologies and cultures, but they were united in the objective of fighting for the rights of equality and justice to be recognised, for the social and political participation of women, for the sharing of responsibilities, for the rights to sexual and reproductive health."
"Today these objectives are more present than ever, and therefore there is still a long way to go."
"This resolution therefore raises fundamental questions such as the need for the European Commission to develop its strategy of monitoring the programme of work, solid links with the Beijing Platform, and promoting gender equality policies, not forgetting the gender perspective in the legislative processes."
"It is important that we do not forget that today, Europe can be a reference point for the rest of the world in terms of equality policies, but in our work and our efforts, we must also keep in mind all the women outside Europe who have absolutely no fundamental rights."
"For them, and for the women of Europe, we need to work hard."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Svensson on the drafting of this resolution on the United Nations Platform for Action for Gender Equality."
"To this day, inequalities between men and women persist in many areas."
"Here I am thinking of employment, where the wage gap is flagrant and where it is still difficult to reconcile family life and a career."
"I could list many other cases."
"In spite of the efforts made to combat inequality between men and women, none of the goals of the Beijing +15 Platform for Action have been fully realised."
"It is not a question of forever redefining our goals here, as we know them well."
"Rather, we must reconsider the measures put in place to achieve them."
"It therefore seems to me to be essential that the European Union spell out its strategy within the framework of the goals of the United Nations Platform for Action, focusing on three major areas."
"Our strategy must consider the short, medium and long terms."
"In the short term, there must be a detailed examination of all sensitive areas, in the context of the economic and financial crisis."
"It is a matter of defining precise indicators allowing us to evaluate and measure the impact of the crisis on employment and the economic situation of women."
"These indicators must be concentrated on economic, social and environmental aspects."
"In the medium term, it is a question at national level of regularly monitoring and of updating the statistical data that we have."
"This is why regular revision of the series of indicators already developed within the framework of the Beijing Platform for Action must be conducted as a function of the relevance of the political, economic and social context."
"Taking these two aspects into account will provide us with the consistency we need at European level to achieve our common goals."
"Finally, in the long term, we must ensure that gender equality policies are integrated, but also encourage the exchange of good practice between the Member States and, of course, ensure that the European Commission's roadmap matches the progress achieved."
"By adopting this structure at three levels, we will markedly increase our chances of finally realising our main goals."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Beijing +15 is confronted this year with a financial, economic and employment crisis that is having a negative impact on the living and working conditions of millions of women throughout Europe and the world, but which may represent an opportunity to review development models, the organisation of the labour market and social policies."
"In strengthening the Beijing +15 objectives, the European Union must prioritise, on behalf of women, policies for providing access to environmental resources and credit, including by means of micro-finance; the balance between family life and work life, including by means of the adoption of the directive on parental leave; training policies and incentives for businesses that employ young people and women; and the fight against trafficking in human beings with a new directive, which we hope will be based on the resolution approved during the last part-session in Strasbourg."
"Above all, we must focus development cooperation support on the empowerment of women in the poorest countries, and in African countries in particular, building a possible Euro-African alliance with the women."
"It would be good - I am addressing the Commissioner and the President here - if the European delegation in New York promoted and gained support for the campaign to award the Nobel Peace Prize to the women of Africa, symbolically represented by the leaders of associations active in those countries worst affected by conflicts and poverty."
"(FR) Today, we are debating equality between men and women, 15 years after the Fourth World Conference on Women, which took place in Beijing, and we are also celebrating the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"I would like to establish a link between the two, as it is certainly true that women remain the main victims of job insecurity."
"In France, for example, they represent 80% of part-time workers, with precarious and poorly paid jobs."
"Eighty per cent of women also earn less than the minimum wage, meaning that, in the end, they draw pensions that border on the minimum subsistence income."
"Added to that is the fact that the average pay gap between women and men persists at a very high level."
"To a degree, therefore, gender equality exists only in theory, and women, who furthermore are still faced with a large number of family responsibilities, are sometimes forced to do several jobs for several employers and yet still end up earning less than men."
"That is why we absolutely must introduce public policies that specifically target these inequalities, both in the labour market and in the home, as well as social security systems that actively respond to women's needs."
"Without such measures, the Beijing goals are liable to remain in the realms of utopia."
"(LT) The principle of gender equality is very important to the European Union in striving for the goals of growth, employment and social cohesion."
"The European Union has made great progress in implementing the Beijing Platform, but we cannot be entirely satisfied with the current situation."
"The report on the implementation of the Beijing Platform has shown that in the European Union, the goals it set out have not yet been achieved."
"It is very important that the Beijing indicators are used to develop the gender equality perspective in national reform programmes, as well as in national reports on social security and social inclusion."
"There is still a lack of sufficiently reliable and comparable data both at national and EU level determining social indicators, including the poverty of women, violence against women and institutional mechanisms."
"One of the tasks of the European Institute for Gender Equality is to handle comparable data."
"The aims laid out in the institute's work programme should particularly help implement the indicators set out in Beijing."
"I am convinced that, at the time of the economic recession, it is essential to strengthen institutional mechanisms for gender equality."
"Mr President, I thank colleagues for their contributions to this debate."
"I recently addressed a high-level group of public service workers, women who had reached the highest level on their jobs, and they were concerned about how they could make more progress."
"I want to turn this debate around a little because I think we spend too much time trying to push women up into professions and not looking at why there are professions that men do not get involved in."
"The key reason is that they are not paid well enough, and I will be quite basic on this - we do not pay people enough to do the cleaning work, the work that nobody wants to do."
"Maybe if we looked at how we distribute payments in these sorts of professions, we would achieve equality at that level as well as at the other end."
"I think we need to look at these issues if we are to have genuine gender equality."
"I think the Spanish Presidency is very concerned, for example, about the role of women in agriculture."
"Again, they have a huge part to play but it is not recognised and it is certainly not counted, and, again, that is an important aspect of our upcoming reforms on agriculture policy."
"There are two other issues which I want to mention."
"A lot of women are contributing to this debate, but I think we have to be honest about how many of us have dependent children."
"Could we be here if we had?"
"Yes, but only because we earn a great deal more money than other people who cannot follow suit."
"Lastly, let us acknowledge the women of Iran."
"Yesterday, we heard from them and I think this House and this debate should recognise their struggle and wish them well."
"(RO) Equal opportunities for men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union enshrined in Community legislation."
"In 2009, women accounted for 24% of members of national parliaments, 26% of members of national governments and 33% of CEOs of European companies, as well as for 18% of professors at European public universities."
"I also wish to mention that 81.3% of young women have completed at least secondary education, while 59% of university graduates in the European Union are women."
"The European Union's strategy for growth and employment aims to ensure that by 2010, the employment rate among women should be 60%."
"However, the risk of poverty among women is primarily due to the situation of single-parent families headed by women."
"I believe that it is important for us to guarantee women equal opportunities for developing and planning their career, as well as conditions supporting a personal, professional and family life balance."
"On this point, I want to stress the importance of child care facilities."
"We are aiming to ensure that 30% of children under the age of three are able to register for and benefit from care services for children in this age group."
"(PT) As we approach the celebration of International Women's Day, the centenary celebrations and 15 years since the approval of the Beijing Platform for Action, we can see that serious problems continue to exist in women's lives, since they are victims of precarious employment, unemployment, growing inequalities, the crisis of capitalism, and violence in society, in the workplace and within the family."
"Poverty has a female face, including here in the European Union, where women make up the majority of the 85 million people who live in poverty."
"For these reasons, we do not merely support the resolution which was approved in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, but also hope that it will be approved by a majority of this Parliament, including the paragraph which emphasises that sexual and reproductive health and rights are an integral part of the women's rights agenda, and that it is essential to step up efforts to improve women's reproductive rights and health, both in Europe and globally."
"It is time to put an end to inequality and stereotypes and prioritise promoting equal rights for women and men in social progress."
"(RO) One of the areas of action specified by the Beijing Platform for Action in 1995 was aimed at combating violence against women."
"Fifteen years on from this historic UN conference, the assessment of the efforts made to improve the situation of women in the world is disappointing."
"Numerous programmes adopted down the years have sadly remained far from a reality, not to mention the Millennium Development Goals, which include the promotion of gender equality."
"Unfortunately, domestic violence, the use of rape as a weapon of war, genital mutilation, forced marriage, human trafficking or sexual slavery remain the nightmare which destroys the lives of millions of women throughout the whole world."
"I believe that we cannot talk in terms of success unless the European Union becomes even more heavily involved in this area."
"We need a comprehensive strategy aimed at tackling poverty, lack of education and information, impunity, armed conflicts and human trafficking for the purposes of prostitution."
"I think that it is important for us not to forget that, before it becomes a cause of evil, violence against women is an effect triggered by a whole set of factors which we must take more united and firm action to eradicate."
"(DE) Mr President, there is a scarlet thread running through the Platform for Action from Beijing, namely non-discrimination."
"That is a good thing."
"Women should not be given a worse deal than men without good and sound reasons."
"However, I do not think that quotas of women - so-called 'positive' discrimination - is a sensible approach to this."
"Skills must be the key criterion, not gender."
"I therefore strongly reject the quota of women in the appointment of the European Commission."
"Instead of concerning ourselves with quotas, we ought really to be focusing on women who are oppressed and discriminated against."
"In Europe, we allow Muslim women to continue to live in a kind of parallel society, where violence against women and other forms of oppression are part of everyday life."
"We allow Muslim women in Europe to have no freedom to make decisions over many areas of their lives."
"It starts with the mode of dress, continues through education to their choice of career, as well as to their choice of husband."
"Women's rights campaigners from Islamic countries approach us, hoping that something will be done about it here."
"Where is the Europe of human rights when we need it?"
"I therefore believe that we should stop these artificial discussions about quotas and instead work to combat the massive discrimination that occurs daily in Europe under the guise of the freedom of religion - this truly has no place in our enlightened community of values."
"(SK) Had it not been for the previous speaker, yourself and the Minister, we would have been a women's group discussing how to improve gender equality."
"This is unquestionably one of the most important issues in modern society and in the modern age and I agree with Mrs Svensson that there is an essential need to coordinate activities at all levels."
"Besides the actual problem of persistent gender inequality, there is also an absence at the European level of a high quality gender-differentiated resolution of the agreed indicators, for example, in the areas of female poverty, violence against women or the human rights of women."
"The Commission should therefore give Eurostat the task of developing links to coordinate the collection of comparative data or data from the Member States, while, at the same time, the Commission should put pressure on the Member States to cooperate actively with Eurostat."
"Despite this, the EU is still a world leader in the field of gender equality and I think we should share with the rest of the world the examples of good practice that we already have in the EU."
"In the next round of negotiations, we should also talk about the good things we have managed to achieve."
"I believe that in five years' time, when it will be the 20th anniversary of Beijing, we should finally be able to celebrate greater progress in resolving gender inequality worldwide."
"(DE) Mr President, gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU."
"This principle is stated in the treaties, on websites and is happily cited often and in many places."
"It should therefore be justified to ask why we are always talking about it."
"The answer is, quite simply, because equality is not implemented in many areas."
"I look forward to the day when we no longer need to talk about this and the principle of gender equality has finally been realised in the social sphere."
"Mr President, I agree with all the speeches that have been made, all of them except for a speech by Mr Obermayr, which, incidentally, I only agree with partially."
"I must say that these speeches by female Members are an expression of a new phase that is beginning in the European Union, also in the area of gender equality."
"Gender equality does not only benefit women; it also benefits men."
"Gender equality is an essential principle for coexistence."
"I therefore thought that both women and men would speak today, because it benefits us all, not only women, and I think that the European Union has made a very intelligent commitment to gender equality."
"It has done so in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, which mentions the principle of equality between men and women for the first time in primary law; in Article 3 of that treaty; in Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which states that all the Union's policies must be governed by the principle of gender equality."
"This means all the policies: in other words, the treaties place the principle of gender equality at the heart of European policies, and it has become a core principle on the political agenda of the European Union."
"What we need to do is to put into practice this mandate given to us by the Treaty on European Union."
"This is what the Spanish Presidency wants to do and what the Council of the Union wants to do, and we are convinced that we are going to have the cooperation of the Commission."
"Only yesterday, we had a meeting with the Commission in Madrid."
"Commissioner Reding was there, and we are sure that there is going to be very close cooperation from the Commission to help our ambitions regarding gender equality to become a reality during this Presidency."
"To begin with, just to mention something that is coming up soon, 8 March is going to be an important day, as it is International Women's Day, when the European Parliament in Strasbourg will discuss the Women's Charter."
"On the same day, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will also discuss the idea of equality linked to social cohesion, which is another of the Union's principles, gender equality linked to social cohesion and eradicating violence."
"The subject that has been mentioned most frequently in your speeches has probably been the need to eradicate gender violence, which is the greatest scourge on our societies, the worst of our societies: violence against women."
"I am sure that the protection order against gender violence is going to be one of the achievements, because we will have to see what happens over the coming months as achievements."
"Once again, I will say that we will be counting on the cooperation of the Commission and the European Parliament in this area."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the equality directives started in the 1970s and since then, many directives have not only changed laws in the Member States - there were no laws in the Member States at that time - but have created the laws in the Member States, the laws of equality between men and women at all levels of our society."
"Nevertheless, and you are right in this, we have good laws but practice does not follow."
"I believe that the first thing we will have to do is not to create new laws, but see that the laws are de facto applied in society."
"I dream of a time when we can have a debate in this House and 50% of the speakers are men and 50% are women."
"I have a dream where we no longer need International Women's Day because there is no longer any problem."
"It is nice to dream, practice is there, and we have to take things in hand."
"That is why I am very grateful to the Spanish Presidency which has put the woman question at the top of the priority list."
"I am very dedicated, together with my colleagues in the Commission, to have gender mainstreaming included in all the policies which we are going to present."
"Together with my colleague Mr Andor, who is responsible for employment, we will see that this is put into practice in the 2020 programme."
"For the other elements I will, as I have already said, work together with the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality on the new strategy for equality where questions such as the gender pay gap and women in decision making will be high on the agenda because they are real structural problems which we need to solve."
"But there are also questions of society which go very deep and which we have to tackle with the help of women's organisations, with the help of the Ministers in the Member States, with the help of national laws, with the help of European laws, and there is, of course, the terrible question of violence against women."
"I believe that this is going to be at the forefront of the work which we are going to lead."
"I think nevertheless, ladies, that when your strong delegation goes to New York to celebrate 15 years of the Beijing Platform, we should be proud, because if we look at what we have achieved in the last 15 years, it is a great deal."
"All right, we have not yet arrived at where our dreams will lead us, but we have achieved much and, through this experience, we can very much help women on other continents."
"That will be the subject of the New York meeting."
"It will not only look at what European women are doing, but also at what European women, European policies, the development policies can do for women in other continents."
"I also believe in this sense that the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is a beautiful text which should be read by every child in the European schools and which should be worked on by every student in our universities, really makes the right point: there is no difference between men and women."
"They are equal and it is our responsibility to see that we speak up when this fundamental question is not put into practice in our application of laws in the Member States."
"It is not only in this place where we should speak up; we should speak up in our Member States, too, and point to the problems which are arising and which are not solved, and not keep quiet until we have solved the problem."
"I make a call to all the men in this Parliament."
"Please join your voices to the voices of the women."
"I have received one motion for a resolutionto wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The United Nations introduced International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which the whole world celebrates on 25 November every year."
"This phenomenon is very widespread, with 45% of women in Europe victims of different forms of violence."
"At a global level, one woman in three has been beaten, forced to have sexual intercourse or been abused in other ways."
"This phenomenon is reflected not only in violence in the family against women and girls, but also through exploitation, acts of sexual violence, human trafficking, honour crimes, dangerous traditional practices, such as the burning of brides or early marriages, and other forms of violence against women's bodies, minds and dignity."
"In most cases, the aggressor is the husband or partner, or an acquaintance."
"I think that violence against women is one of the most serious human rights violations."
"It is also all the more serious as it is present on every continent, in every country and culture, regardless of the level of economic development."
"The perpetrators of these acts must be severely punished."
"In the case of large-scale offences, the International Criminal Court must play an important role and establish a close correlation with the decisions made by national courts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the 15th anniversary of the famous World Conference on equal rights for women, organised by the UN in Beijing, is just approaching."
"During those 15 years, the 189 countries which signed the UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality have managed to make a certain amount of progress in all 12 areas of concern identified in the document."
"However, most of the problems identified then are still current today, in particular, the problem of domestic violence against women and the involvement of women in armed conflicts."
"These subjects do not need to be presented in the European Parliament - we discuss them during debates on cases of human rights violations at almost every plenary session."
"Therefore, I would like to express my esteem for the UN initiative."
"Every five years, a detailed review of the Platform for Action is conducted in a great many countries (the last time was in 2005), and the most urgent matters are highlighted."
"Five years ago, at the conference in New York, the attention of countries which are signatories to the Platform for Action was drawn to the high numbers of rapes committed against women, the rise of HIV/AIDS infections among women and the discrimination which exists against women in employment."
"Unfortunately, those observations could be made again, today."
"What is needed is a very specific action plan, with the real support of all signatories to the Platform and with the involvement of the European Union, so that at the next review of the programme in five years' time, clear progress will be evident."
"I firmly believe that gender equality must be among the key objectives of any democracy."
"While considerable efforts have been made in the European Union to achieve the objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action, it has not been possible to meet them all."
"We still face in Europe strong stereotypes associated with women and significant gender pay gaps, while the progress made in terms of attracting more women to take up decision-making positions has been extremely slow."
"However, in general, equal opportunities remain, unfortunately, only an aspiration, especially in the countries of Eastern Europe, the new members of the EU."
"In order to attain better results in Member States in terms of achieving the objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action, reliable, comparable data on the situation of women is an absolute must, both at European and national level."
"There should also be a regular review carried out of the progress made in the critical areas identified by the Platform."
"However, I am pleased that the Spanish Presidency has included the problems of gender equality in its list of priorities and has focused particular attention on women working in the agricultural sector."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to congratulate it on this initiative."
"One of the strategic areas defined in the Beijing Platform for Action is that of the rights of women as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights."
"The objective is to fully introduce international instruments for the protection of these rights, including the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women."
"One form of discrimination is violation of the reproductive rights of women."
"A report on respect for reproductive rights in Poland in 2007 and the recommendations of the UN Human Rights Committee which are based on this report show clearly that Polish women have difficulties in gaining access to reimbursable contraception, medical care during pregnancy, prenatal tests and even to pain-free labour."
"They are denied the possibility of a legal abortion in practically every case, even in cases which are permissible under law."
"As a result, 200-400 legal terminations of pregnancy are performed in Poland every year, compared to 100 000 illegal ones."
"I propose adoption of a legal abortion rate, calculated as the number of legal terminations of pregnancy per 1 000 live births per year, as a measure of the equality of women in Member States of the EU."
"In countries where women have the right to choose abortion, this rate fluctuates at around 200."
"In Poland, it is 1."
"This is an objective measure of the violation of women's reproductive rights in Poland."
"I appeal for more effective cooperation between the EU and the UN over monitoring of women's rights and the introduction of measurements which quantify violations of women's rights."
"The resolution does not reflect the whole Beijing Platform for Action."
"As ever, it is easier to dwell on sexual stereotypes, 'reproductive health', not to mention abortion, CEDAW, violence and quotas."
"Are there no other problems for the vast majority of women and mothers in Europe and throughout the world?"
"Is it not time to tackle other obstacles as well?"
"Point 9 of the Beijing Platform for Action, however, declares as its goal the empowerment of all women."
"It is essential that all women can identify with public equal opportunities policies, which respect their natural difference and their necessary complementary nature, and do not lose sight of the importance of national and regional identities or historical, cultural and religious diversity."
"The implementation of the Platform for Action falls under the sovereign responsibility of each Member State, taking into account and showing strict respect for diverse religious and ethical values, and for the cultural heritage and philosophical convictions of individuals and their communities."
"Had the implementation of the Beijing Platform respected these premises, we would not have observed just a slight improvement in the situation of women."
"This resolution sends out a biased signal that divides rather than unites."
"I fully support Mrs Svensson's work on the problem of gender equality, and I agree that the issues she has raised have a significant influence on the process of achieving equal rights for women and men."
"At the same time, I would like to point out that many women consciously and freely choose to work in the home on behalf of the family."
"Sometimes they are forced to give up their career for unforeseen reasons, such as the need to care for an ill or disabled child."
"A significant problem in this situation is the lack of appropriate solutions concerning retirement pension entitlements for these women."
"In many countries, there are no solutions at all in this area, or those which are in place are not sufficient to ensure women a decent living."
"Therefore, it is essential, too, that the debate on gender equality should also include the matter of the entitlement to benefits of women who run the home and care for children."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance under Rule 150."
"We are going to give preference to those Members who did not take the floor during the last period of one-minute speeches under Rule 150 over those who did take the floor last time."
"(RO) On 4 February 2010, Traian BÄsescu, the President of Romania, announced the decision confirming the Supreme Council of National Defence's approval of Romania's participation in the US anti-missile system."
"The agreement is due to be submitted to the Romanian Parliament for approval."
"At the same time, the president stated that the agreement is not targeted at Russia."
"I believe that this allows Romania to demonstrate its ability to act as a strategic partner of the United States in the Black Sea region and become a net European supplier of security."
"In the current context of tough global challenges, the Romanian-US agreement will inextricably consolidate the security system for European allies."
"It is my belief that the European Union will welcome this major agreement."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to express my profound alarm at the rapidly worsening situation of fellow Poles in Lithuania."
"Lithuania is a member of the European Union."
"In spite of this, the fundamental rights of the Polish national minority are being violated in Lithuania."
"There are almost 300 000 Poles in Lithuania, in regions where they make up 60-80% of the population, but they are not entitled to use their mother tongue as an auxiliary language in official situations."
"A court has ordered the removal of bilingual street names."
"Court enforcement officers are being sent to enforce this order."
"Polish names are being Lithuanianised."
"Poles are suffering discrimination during restitution of land."
"The right of Polish children to receive education with Polish as the medium of instruction is being curtailed."
"The electoral rights of their parents are being restricted."
"The future of the Union is currently in the balance."
"Do we still want to live in a Europe of illusory values, or of real values?"
"Which direction the Union goes in depends, in part, on us."
"Are we going to turn a blind eye to overt discrimination against a minority, or are we really going to build a secure Europe in a spirit of respect for human rights?"
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to report something to Parliament and ask for its support."
"I want to report that in the south of the Union, in the industrious and enterprising city of Valencia, there is an historic marine quarter called CabaÃ±al, which could be destroyed by a plan that the council wants to implement after abandoning the area for almost 20 years."
"The local residents have protested against this plan."
"At the request of the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Culture has ruled that the plan will amount to a desecration of heritage, and the Constitutional Court also recently tried to stop it or ruled that it should be stopped."
"The response of the public authorities has been to refuse to submit to the institutions, with the resulting risk, danger and lack of political concern."
"The plea for support that I am making is for the local residents to receive the help that they ask for from Parliament regarding this desecration of heritage, to ensure that such a major, barbaric aberration cannot take place in a district such as CabaÃ±al in the south of the European Union."
"(RO) Last week, I attended the meeting of the European Union-Moldova Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"The results of this meeting are extremely encouraging in terms of bilateral relations and the Republic of Moldova moving closer to the European Union."
"The pro-European government in ChiÅinÄu has made visible progress in the few months since it took power."
"I believe that this progress is a clear sign of the sincere desire to embark on a one-way path to Europe."
"The political will of the Republic of Moldova's current government to promote reforms aimed at building a sound democracy and prosperous economy is evident from the discussions last week."
"I welcome the start of the negotiations on a new association agreement in January this year."
"I believe that the European Parliament must be actively involved in this process and support the conclusion of such an agreement and a visa waiver scheme."
"The Republic of Moldova shares the European Union's values."
"This is why I believe that both the European Commission and European Parliament must support this government with financial assistance, which must be granted as quickly as possible, as well as through the expertise the European Union has to offer in the various areas targeted for reform, such as justice or the economy."
"(PL) Mr President, unfortunately, I am having to speak, once again, about the situation of the Polish minority in a Member State of the European Union - Lithuania."
"It might seem that if a state does belong to the European Union it should observe all European standards."
"However, Vilnius is not doing this."
"There is still no agreement in Lithuania over bilingual street names in places where the Polish population is not so much a minority as a majority."
"There are significant problems over the operation of education with Polish as the medium of instruction."
"As a result of action taken by the Lithuanian education authorities, around 100 Polish school classes are to be closed."
"Recently, significant restrictions have been imposed on artistic groups which propagate Polish culture."
"There is a strange imbalance here, because Lithuanians in Poland are guaranteed all their rights and receive large subsidies from the Polish state budget."
"It is time for an elementary and civilised response."
"It is time international organisations, including our own European Parliament, took up the matter of discrimination against Poles in Lithuania."
"Mr President, this evening, I attended a reception for the Shen Yun Performing Arts Group in the Members' Salon."
"Last year, I had the pleasure of seeing the Shen Yun Show in London."
"Its purpose is to revive interest in and to illustrate traditional Chinese culture, a culture of course that the Chinese Communist Party and government have done their best to destroy over the last 60 years."
"I was appalled to learn this evening that a planned performance in Romania in April had been cancelled because of pressure from the Chinese Government."
"It is completely unacceptable that Romania, a country that claims to be a democracy, allows itself to be pressurised in this way by a Communist tyranny."
"I should also say that Shen Yun promotes the philosophy of truthfulness, tolerance and compassion so it is not surprising that the Chinese Government and Communist Party fear that contrary ideology."
"I would like to suggest to the President, Mr Buzek, that we redress the situation by inviting Shen Yun to stage a sample performance in the Parliament at the earliest convenient date."
"This would be a clear gesture of support to those incomparably brave Chinese democracy activists."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to condemn in this House the fake use of Irish, British, French and German passports in the recent killing of the Hamas commander."
"The chief of the Dubai police said he was 99% certain that Mossad was behind the killing."
"If that is the case, this was a flagrant abuse of EU passports to commit a crime in a third country and particularly a breach of trust where Ireland is concerned because, ever since we got our independence in 1922, we have been a neutral and friendly country thus allowing our citizens to travel, maybe more freely, in places where other people would not be allowed to travel."
"The use of the fake passports in this situation has jeopardised that position, especially in Dubai."
"I would call on the High Representative in particular to investigate this matter and, if the government or Mossad were behind it, redress should be given to us and to the other countries involved."
"Mr President, we will get over this confusion eventually."
"The regional aid map for State aid rules in Europe is in serious need of redrawing."
"A major concern is that when I wrote to the previous Commission on this, they were basing their policy on 2006 figures from Eurostat."
"Now that the regional aid map is up for review, it is extremely important to recognise that the European economy is in a dramatically different picture."
"Taking just one example in my own country, unemployment levels in the mid-west of the country have grown by over 40% in the last year and this without mentioning the previous years where figures were rising already."
"Areas in the mid-west, like Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, need large-scale state funding to stimulate primary job creation, and it is getting to critical levels."
"Given the dramatic turnaround in the Irish economy, as in other economies, the years of 2006 and 2007 might as well have been a lifetime ago."
"While I recognise that it is partly up to Member States to inform the Commission of any changes in their economic status, the approach of the Commission should not remain the same regardless."
"(RO) Ladies and gentlemen, I think that the most important gift that God has given Man is the dog."
"You are familiar with the quotation from Madame Roland, who would be guillotined during the French Revolution: 'The more I see of men, the more I admire dogs,' while Lord Byron wrote: 'Dogs have all the virtues of man without his vices.'"
"I represent in this Chamber several millions of animal-lovers from my country who are outraged by the cruelty shown towards stray dogs which are ruthlessly killed."
"Foreign visitors to Romania are appalled to see dogs' dead bodies lying on the roads, a barbaric sight which even children have to witness."
"At the moment, the prefect of Bucharest is requesting an amendment to a law amended by the Romanian Parliament, calling for the elimination of stray dogs."
"However, dogs are guardian angels."
"It is also well known that in days gone by, they helped protect the health of the inhabitants of fortified towns because where there are dogs, there are no rats or snakes."
"I ask the European Parliament to request that the Romanian Government complies with the Universal Declaration of Animal Rights issued in Paris in 1978."
"We must put an end to the massacre of stray dogs in Romania."
"Anyone who does not love animals does not love people either."
"For goodness' sake, we are, after all, living in the third millennium AD!"
"Mr President, I would like to denounce the situation of the Catalan and European swine sector."
"The price of pigs has continued to decrease for over a year and for several months now, has been clearly below the production cost."
"One of the reasons why it is happening is because of pig imports from emerging countries."
"In too many cases, these imports enter the European Union without being sufficiently controlled at European customs."
"In too many cases, these pig imports do not fulfil several European regulations on quality and food security that the European Union imposes only on European producers."
"It seems that the same will happen in the coming years: increasing animal welfare requirements for European producers but with no controls on imports from emerging countries."
"This is a clear case of unfair competition."
"In this way, Europe will lose its farmers and pig producers and, without them, Europe will lose an important part of its agri-food industry."
"These worries I wanted to share with you."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to refer to the situation of national minorities in Lithuania, where their rights are continually being reduced."
"In Lithuania, in areas populated by concentrations of national minorities, there is a general ban on the use of bilingual information signs, which have been used for 20 years."
"Schools for national minorities have had their subsidies reduced, and preparations are being made for their closure as part of what is being called a 'reform'."
"The original spelling of foreign names cannot be used in identity documents."
"Furthermore, difficulties are being created for Poles in Lithuania who are trying to regain land seized by the Communist system, and recently even the cultural life of minorities has been hit."
"Wilia, the oldest traditional Polish song and dance group in Lithuania, has had its government funding reduced to a quarter of its former level, and three full-time positions have been closed, leaving only one."
"The rights of national minorities in Lithuania should be respected as the Union requires in its motto: Unity in Diversity."
"Mr President, Mr Tremosa i Balcells raised the issue of low-cost production in agriculture and it is an issue which I have huge concerns about, as do many others in this House."
"However, I am more concerned about the Commission and how they view agriculture, rural areas and indeed the food industry because, in the EU 2020 strategy, they seem to have almost forgotten about this vital sector of the European Union."
"I would urge the Commission not to ignore this important area."
"I hope that it does not reflect a view that this sector is not important any more, particularly as we look at reforming the European Union's budget."
"I would remind the Commission that the agriculture and food sector is vital for food security reasons, for environmental protection reasons, and for jobs in rural areas."
"I think that this view needs to be reflected in the EU 2020 strategy."
"I thank a young farmers' organisation in Ireland, Macra na Feirme, who represent men and women, for bringing this matter to my attention and I hope the Commission is listening."
"(RO) The unemployment rate hit 10% in the euro area at the start of the year, compared to 9.6% in the EU-27."
"The figure for young people is more than 21%."
"Roughly 20 million companies operate in the European Union, excluding the financial sector, with 99% of these being small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Two thirds of the total workforce in the private sector are employed by SMEs."
"I call on the Commission and Member States to draw up a package of measures aimed specifically at supporting SMEs to help them out of the economic and financial crisis."
"This package of measures should also be targeted at those proposing to set up small or medium-sized businesses."
"These measures might include, for example, the suitable adaptation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the Seventh Framework Programme for research, as well as the simplification of the administrative criteria and procedures to facilitate SMEs' access to projects carried out using European funds."
"Last but not least, as in the case of the farmers, I propose granting government guarantees for loans taken out by SMEs to help them out of the crisis, obviously for a fixed period of time and up to a certain ceiling."
"(EL) Mr President, the problem of illegal immigration in Greece is far worse than in the rest of the European Union, as we all know."
"There are various reasons for this, ranging from its geographical location to its long coastal border."
"Under these circumstances, the initiative by the Greek Government, which is facilitating the acquisition of Greek nationality by immigrants in an unprecedented manner, is - at best - an improvisation in times such as these and has given rise to the following paradox: the proposal by the government of the country with the most acute problem contains the most lenient regulations, at every level, in the entire European Union."
"This is encouraging rather than discouraging illegal immigration, to the detriment of legal immigration."
"It is undermining social cohesion and taking a fragmented approach to the issue, by only examining the last link in a chain which includes illegal entry, asylum, deportation and leave to remain and work in the European Union."
"It is opening the window to the acquisition of European nationality to an indeterminate number of illegal immigrants."
"From this perspective, it is a European question which we should address intensively in the immediate future."
"(RO) Respect for the right to privacy has become a particularly topical subject of late, with the introduction of new information technologies."
"In addition to the beneficial impact of these technologies in numerous areas, the issue of intrusion into citizens' privacy has also arisen and, by extension, the need to regulate access to personal data."
"I am referring here to the fact that citizens must be guaranteed the right to verify the collection, storage, use and distribution of their personal data."
"Current data protection legislation has been lagging behind and is no longer able to resolve all the problems which have occurred."
"A large amount of feedback from public opinion clearly supports the need for tight regulation of the right to privacy."
"The European Union's efforts to create a satisfactory legal database in this area are welcome but, in my view, they are still not sufficient to meet the new challenges."
"(Applause)"
"(CS) More than six months have passed since Canada took the unprecedented step of re-imposing visa requirements on one of the EU Member States, in this case, for citizens of the Czech Republic."
"Canada justified its move on the grounds that, on the other side of the ocean, Czech citizens, particularly Roma, were applying en masse for asylum."
"In these circumstances I would like to say that in the Czech Republic, the same conditions apply to everyone, regardless of whether they have Czech, Slovak, Vietnamese or Ukrainian nationality or whether they are of Czech, Afro-American or Roma origin."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, which is part of our constitutional law, declares equal national and ethnic rights for all citizens."
"The fact that Canada explains its actions with reference to the Roma is, in itself, discriminatory, because it is an admission that visa conditions are being changed because of one ethnic group."
"Instead of costly and administratively-demanding visas, Canada should, if anything, think hard about these conditions."
"(ES) Mr President, as you know, on 11 February, Parliament said no to the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme, the SWIFT programme."
"Consequently, the agreement has been suspended, and no data is being transferred."
"The Commission does, however, have a new mandate to negotiate."
"The question that I would like to put to the Presidency of the European Parliament - not to you, but to the actual Presidency - is whether we have an interlocutor, whether the United States is negotiating with the European Union following the collapse, or whether it is negotiating case by case on a bilateral basis with certain Member States."
"In any case, Mr President, if these negotiations do take place, I demand that the European Parliament plays a role in the negotiations, a demand that I think all of us share."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 23 February in Villasanta, Lombardy, an exceptional discharge of hydrocarbons from a tank in a disused refinery resulted in massive contamination of the nearby River Lambro."
"The scale of the environmental disaster, in which thousands of cubic metres of oil were spilt, not only undermines the ecosystem of the River Lambro, with consequences for the fauna too, but is also in danger of spreading - in spite of the action taken - to the River Po, which runs across the entire Po Valley until it meets the Adriatic Sea."
"The exceptional and urgent nature of the situation, which has already led the Lombardy region to request that a state of emergency be declared, is nonetheless such as to require intervention from the European Union too - and I call for a signal via the Presidency - both from the point of view of coordinating the environmental initiatives in the areas at risk, which certainly include the Po area, and in respect of the amount of financial resources that will be required for the absolutely crucial restoration of the environmental situation of this vast area affected by a huge environmental disaster."
"(PT) Regional disparities remain a challenge in the context of the European Union."
"For this reason, it is essential that cohesion policy continues to support the less developed regions."
"I therefore welcome the initiative for an EU strategy for the Baltic Sea Region and the ongoing initiative for the Danube region."
"I urge Parliament, for the same reasons, to give some careful consideration to the possibility of new strategies for other regions."
"In south-western Europe, for example, Macaronesia (the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and Cape Verde) faces various shared challenges, and so a strategy for this region would improve communication systems, preserve the environment, promote growth, scientific exchange, job creation and security, and facilitate the fight against illegal immigration."
"This would also be a development for Europe's Atlantic frontier and would establish another bridge between Europe and Africa."
"(PT) I would like to point out that, in island regions, air transport is sometimes the only means of access and that operating conditions depend on the volume of passengers and cargo carried."
"While there are some island regions where these volumes are large enough to attract many air transport operators - bringing competition and low transport prices, and thus improving accessibility - there are other areas, such as the Azores, where these volumes are much lower, and this makes them unattractive to operators."
"As a result, air fares are higher, hindering the mobility of people and limiting the area's attractiveness to tourists, which would allow their enormous potential for development and for diversifying their economic base to flourish and become stronger."
"This constraint is particularly harsh in times of crisis such as the period we are experiencing at present."
"This means that temporary assistance is crucial for promoting an increase in passenger and cargo volumes so that the market can begin to function."
"This would also allow these regions, which have a high potential for tourism, to be included in the objectives of the trans-European networks, which aim at expanding towards the edges of Europe."
"(PL) Despite the fact that many economists and politicians have already announced the end of the crisis in Europe, we are still struggling with its negative consequences."
"Monthly data on the level of unemployment in the Union is increasingly depressing."
"There are currently over 23 million people in Europe who are without work."
"This means the crisis has ruined the efforts which have been made over many years to promote employment."
"An exceptionally detrimental phenomenon is the continually rising number of unemployed young people."
"Currently, one in five young Europeans is now without work."
"It should be assumed that this situation will lead to exceptionally harmful social consequences, such as a rise in crime, alcoholism, drug abuse and problem families."
"As for possible ways to get out of the recession quickly, I think we should make good use of our greatest asset - the Community's internal market."
"Greater coordination is needed at European level to make full use of the possibilities of the common economic space."
"We need further simplification of the rules for its operation, and we need to develop true economic union."
"(RO) Due to the expiry of its GMP standard in early February, the Cantacuzino National Institute of Research and Development for Microbiology and Immunology, based in Bucharest, has had its licence withdrawn for manufacturing and marketing injectable products, including vaccines."
"Following the implementation of the corrective action plan drawn up by the management of the Cantacuzino Institute, along with the National Medicines Agency, and approved by the Ministry of Health, the Cantacuzino Institute is expected to regain authorisation to manufacture vaccines in the second half of April."
"However, we should not forget that discontinuation of the operation of an institute of national and European strategic importance, such as the Cantacuzino Institute, entails a high potential hazard."
"This is why I believe that it is important for European institutions to exert tighter control, which will prevent the recurrence of such a situation at European level in the future."
"(EL) Mr President, with all due respect to you, I hereby request that you provide us tomorrow with a list of all those who asked to speak for one minute based on two criteria: firstly, that they did not speak during the previous plenary and, secondly, the time at which they filed their request."
"With all due respect to both you and the Bureau, I do not think that it is the Bureau's privilege to allocate time as it so pleases."
"There are certain principles and the first principle is the principle of transparency."
"We shall await the list tomorrow - and I see that other members agree and approve - with the two criteria, namely: the criterion of the time at which they filed their request and the criterion of whether or not they spoke during the previous plenary."
"The criteria that we use, as you know, is equal distribution of the speeches between the different political groups based on the size of the group and also giving preference to those who did not speak during the previous sitting."
"Those are the criteria that we use."
"(EL) Mr President, not one person from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance spoke today, while five or even seven members spoke from other groups."
"I ask you."
"This is what I explained before, Mr Tremopoulos."
"We had three requests to speak from your Group."
"All of those Members had spoken in the previous sitting."
"We therefore used this criterion to distribute the speeches equally."
"(ES) Are these criteria chosen by you or by the services for the sitting?"
"Are they written down anywhere?"
"The list of the Members who requested the floor shows which Members took the floor under Rule 150 in the previous sitting."
"Based on this information, the Presidency gives the floor to all the political groups."
"By chance, the three Members from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who asked for the floor had already taken the floor in the previous sitting."
"We therefore did not give them preference."
"This is what happens."
"We try to ensure that everyone can speak, in accordance with the size of the corresponding group and the criterion that I explained to you regarding those who did not speak in the previous sitting."
"(ES) This might be a very reasonable criterion, but is it written down in any rules or in the Rules of Procedure of the plenary or of Parliament?"
"The Presidency uses its powers and interprets the correct way to run the sitting in a fair and balanced way for all the groups."
"Mr President, I would like to ask whether I am on the list of those who asked to speak today, and whether I am also on the list of those who spoke at the last plenary."
"Is it possible to have an answer to this question right now?"
"I will inform you right now."
"Mrs Paliadeli, you are on the list of speakers from the Socialist Group."
"The order of speaking is the order in which you asked for the floor: you are registered in the order in which you asked for the floor."
"We have given the floor to six Members of your Group."
"Mr President, on what grounds?"
"Chronological order - time order."
"On this list, you were number nine."
"I shall continue with the sitting."
"(Intervention from the floor)"
"I have explained the criteria."
"What else do you want to know?"
"Mr President, the only problem we have is that it would be good to know in advance who will take the floor."
"It is 10 o'clock in the evening and we are staying for nothing if we do not receive a speaking slot."
"I think we should have a rule that we should know at least two hours in advance who will take the floor in the one-minute speeches."
"We will take your comments into account."
"Mr President, it is not your fault at all but it is an absolute shambles."
"We have waited here tonight for many hours to speak."
"It is now 10 o'clock in the evening."
"The one-minute speeches come in, we get allocated time but it is pathetic."
"If we are going to spend our time here on important issues for our own regions, we should certainly be allowed to have our say."
"There must be a set-up within your organisation, within this nonsense of a Parliament, so that we can actually say that we are going to be here and we can be given time to speak."
"To think that we spend all this time here waiting and sitting in the hope of getting a speech is nonsense."
"Our people back in our country, in the UK, are fed up with this nonsense because we cannot speak up for their rights and their issues."
"This is an absolutely travesty."
"I say to you take it back to Mr Barroso."
"I have mentioned it to him before that this whole thing is a farce."
"If I am going to be here at 10 o'clock at night on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night, then we should at least be given a chance to speak on important issues relating to our Member States."
"I ask you, Sir, take it back now to your governors because this is not a democracy, it is a dictatorship."
"Thank you."
"I should remind you that Mr Barroso is the President of the Commission, not of the European Parliament."
"(IT) Mr President, if, instead of all this squabbling, we had had the opportunity to take the floor, we perhaps could have also done our electorate a good turn, since it is 10 o'clock in the evening and we all knew that we should have taken the floor."
"Every one of us comes here to voice the demands of our electorate."
"One minute of speaking time is already very little, and shortening the list is, in my view, also rather arrogant."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the situation is very clear."
"We have half an hour for these speeches, so I have to keep to the half hour."
"Those of you who ask for the floor would fill much more than half an hour."
"What the Presidency does is to apply rational, fair criteria, and that is part of its powers."
"I understand your frustration."
"What we will do is, along with the Director of the plenary services, look at a way that we can have an approximate idea - as it will never be exact, but at least an approximate idea - of which of you are going to speak, so that we can minimise the number that are waiting."
"We will do this willingly and do the best that we can."
"Now, with your permission, we are going to continue the sitting, because otherwise we will be here all night discussing the same thing."
"That concludes this item."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - This is a period for critical decisions in the EU and Belarus relationship."
"The Eastern Partnership programme has offered opportunities for the regime in Belarus to relax its rigid control of society and open the way for democratic reforms."
"However, this process needs to be reciprocal."
"The EU's economic assistance and opening of the cooperation projects can result in reliable progress only if each goodwill step by the EU is accompanied by genuine measures toward the re-establishment of an open democratic society in Belarus."
"The assessment of the situation by Sakharov prize winner Milinkevich is pessimistic."
"As he told us, the human rights situation has not improved."
"In fact, it has worsened."
"At the same time, bearing in mind that the Lukashenko regime depends more than ever on Western technology, money and markets, the EU has an efficient leverage over the regime's further behaviour."
"But first we need to understand that the Belarus dictator is probing to see how serious his EU partners really are about the importance of democratic reforms."
"Therefore, it is so crucial to send a clear message that the EU's priority is real changes in the human rights situation."
"Major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the major natural disaster in the autonomous region of Madeira."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission is concerned and saddened by the terrible events in Madeira, especially by the high number of victims."
"I would like to extend my sympathy to all of the inhabitants of Madeira affected by the disaster."
"The Commission extends its condolences to the families of the victims, in particular."
"Yesterday, my colleague, Johannes Hahn, as the competent Member of the Commission, was able to talk to the President of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Mr Jardim, who said that the situation remains serious."
"However, the regional and national emergency services have it under control."
"It does not currently require support from the European Civil Protection Mechanism."
"That said, the damage is so severe that Madeira is hoping for financial aid from the EU Solidarity Fund."
"The Commission is currently examining all possible means for providing EU financial aid to Madeira."
"Back in 2003, following the horrific fire disaster, we were able to grant solidarity aid amounting to more than EUR 48 million to Portugal."
"The Solidarity Fund was created in 2002 to be able to provide financial assistance at EU level to Member States affected by serious natural disasters."
"However, the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund is subject to certain criteria being met."
"The most important prerequisite is the submission of an application for assistance by the Portuguese Government."
"May I remind you that the Regulation establishing the Solidarity Fund normally only permits mobilisation of the fund for large-scale disasters where the cost of the damage exceeds a threshold of 0.6% of the gross national income of the State affected."
"For Portugal, this currently means that the cost of the damage must exceed EUR 958 million."
"However, in exceptional circumstances, and if particular criteria are met, assistance may also be granted for smaller, 'regional' disasters, particularly if one of the outermost regions, like Madeira, is affected."
"As the Commission does not yet have sufficient information about the extent of the damage, it is still too early to say whether these conditions will be met."
"The authorities in Portugal should now carry out a swift and thorough assessment of the damage and submit an application to the Commission within ten weeks."
"My colleague Mr Hahn will meet with Portugal's Interior Minister, Mr Pereira, this Friday to discuss where to go from here."
"On 6 and 7 March, Mr Hahn will visit Madeira in order to see the damage first hand."
"The European Commission's Directorate-General for Regional Policy will be available to provide any support that may be required to help Portugal's authorities to prepare the application."
"I would like to remind you that financial aid from our Solidarity Fund is not paid out straight away."
"The Fund is an instrument to help Member States deal with the financial consequences of disasters; it is not an urgent instrument."
"The resources for the Solidarity Fund are provided by means of an additional contribution from the Member States over and above the normal budget."
"It therefore requires the approval of the European Parliament, your approval in other words, and that of the Council, by means of an amendment."
"The whole process, from the time of the application until the aid is paid out, will take several months."
"However, we, the Commission, will make every effort to keep the process as short as possible."
"The Structural Funds are not available for immediate emergency measures."
"They may be able to provide some help in connection with the long-term reconstruction."
"The Commission will discuss the options and possible sensible and necessary programme amendments in the short term with the administrative authorities in Portugal."
"I would like to assure you that the Commission will do everything in its power to help the people and authorities of Madeira to cope with this terrible natural disaster."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (PT) I take the floor in this Chamber today with my voice weighed down with the distress of someone who personally experienced and witnessed the tragedy that struck Madeira last Saturday."
"Obviously, I join in the feeling of pain and grief that has befallen the families of the 42 victims we now know have died, to whom I offer my condolences and respect for their loss."
"The true extent of this disaster has yet to be revealed, given that the search and rescue teams, who have been working without interruption since Saturday in a Herculean effort which I salute, are only now beginning to reach the most isolated populations."
"It is feared that the number of victims could increase."
"The scene is one of large-scale destruction, involving significant material damage to access routes, with roads and bridges totally destroyed, and to essential services such as water and electricity supplies."
"There are more than 600 displaced persons who have lost their homes and personal possessions."
"The economic and social impact of this catastrophe is preventing people from returning to a normal way of life."
"However, it is now necessary to look forwards."
"We also need to send a message of solidarity, hope and confidence to the people affected."
"Help needs to be given, and the European Union and Parliament, in particular, have a role to play here, as they are fundamental in the process of mobilising the Solidarity Fund."
"Whenever we are called upon to intervene, we have to do so promptly because we cannot ask the people affected to wait, especially when they need us most."
"I hereby appeal to the Commission and its President, Mr Barroso, and to Johannes Hahn, Commissioner for Regional Policy, in particular."
"I welcome his plan to visit Madeira shortly, and ask him to take this message of hope, assistance and support for reconstruction, because now is the time to rebuild what nature has unfortunately taken from us once again."
"I have complete faith that we will do so because, as the anthem of Madeira has taught me, 'the people of Madeira are humble, stoical and brave."
"They are the people who ploughed the earth among the hard rocks; they are heroes of working in the mountain wilderness."
"For Madeira, they will honour their history and through their work, they will strive for and attain happiness and glory.'"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (PT) On behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I wish to express our condolences to the families of the victims, and show our solidarity with the people affected by the tragedy that struck the Autonomous Region of Madeira, in Portugal, on the 20th of this month."
"Torrential rain, strong winds and heavy seas rendered the centre of the tourist city of Funchal unrecognisable and left devastation and death in their wake."
"There has also been great damage to public and private infrastructure, as well as the natural environment and cultural heritage."
"Initial estimates, Commissioner, suggest that damage will exceed EUR 1 billion, so this will fall within the criteria for the Solidarity Fund."
"Unfortunately, there are also dozens of dead to mourn, a considerable number of injured and missing people and hundreds of homeless."
"The images of devastation and suffering have been shown all over the world and no one has remained indifferent."
"Expressions of solidarity have come from all four corners of the globe."
"The European Union and European Commission must also demonstrate their active solidarity with this outermost island region by urgently mobilising the Solidarity Fund, in order to reduce the high social and economic impacts and to help restore normality to the affected area."
"I conclude, Commissioner, by asking the following: this Parliament has already approved changes to the Solidarity Fund."
"Why are these changes not in force?"
"Why are they not being applied?"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) We began this plenary session today with a minute's silence."
"This minute's silence had two meanings: firstly, solidarity with the victims of the catastrophe which struck Madeira and their families, and secondly, a tribute to all the workers who have been tirelessly providing assistance to those victims."
"However, a minute's silence must make us reflect and also lead us to reflect on things that go beyond our immediate concerns here."
"What we saw in Madeira is a phenomenon which will occur more and more often."
"Climate change is causing these extreme events to take place again and again, and we must find ways of responding to them."
"We are not able to avoid natural disasters but, at the same time, we must not simply allow them always to have such tragic effects on the lives of the people."
"That is why we must fight for planning and development policies which are directed at the public good."
"However, I wish to conclude, Mr President, with something that is more important and which has brought us all here: the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European institutions must have the capacity to provide an urgent response to emergency situations."
"Financial resources and the required swiftness of operation are necessary for this purpose."
"(PT) The tragedy in Madeira took many lives, destroyed property and tore through the face of a Portuguese island which was proud of its beauty, which so many visitors from around the world have had the opportunity to see."
"I suppose no one, not even in Portugal - much less in Portugal, in fact - could have been prepared for the horror of the images that were broadcast into our homes in successive news reports, of people being washed away by the waters, houses caving in, bridges collapsing and an entire landscape being altered by the force of nature."
"As can be seen from the statements being made here, despite everything, this is not simply a tragedy which occurred in a region of Portugal."
"It is a tragedy which violently struck part of the European Union which, in solidarity, should provide assistance without reservation."
"It should unreservedly help the families of the victims who have died and the people who have suddenly been left with nothing, and it should assist in the reconstruction of the built environment, by restoring to the island of Madeira what nature has stripped away."
"This, Mr President, is certain: the message of the anthem of Madeira has been mentioned here, but I have also drawn a lesson from the anthem of Portugal, which proclaims, 'heroes of the sea, noble people, brave nation'."
"These are brave people who, as they have shown on other occasions in their history, have always known how to turn things around during difficult times and how to overcome such misfortunes."
"It will happen yet again and, on this occasion, doubtless with the solidarity and help of the whole European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, this is certainly not a nice reason for this debate."
"Madeira has been hit by an unbelievable natural disaster and we extend our condolences to the families affected."
"The European Union must provide support in this situation."
"The solidarity of the whole of the European Union is required here and I can only reiterate what has already been said."
"I urge the Commission to mobilise the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible so that help can be provided."
"I would like to ask the Council to ensure that the reform of the Solidarity Fund that Parliament adopted two years ago is finally implemented, because this will make it possible to provide assistance more quickly to the regions affected."
"We also need to look to the future."
"In recent years, Madeira has received a lot of structural fund resources and will also continue to do so over the next few years."
"These resources need to be used to take preventative action so as to be able to reduce the terrible consequences of natural disasters and therefore also the suffering."
"This is something that, as the European Union, we need to implement in the regions and therefore also in Madeira."
"(PT) The disaster on the island of Madeira requires emergency measures and calls for extraordinary financial assistance to be given to this Autonomous Region."
"Such assistance should be directed towards the reconstruction of the infrastructure and public amenities which have been destroyed or damaged and should also be made available to people affected by the various aspects of the tragedy, whether economic, social or in terms of the family."
"Tragedies are not fair; almost always, those who have the least are those who lose the most."
"It is important, therefore, to identify and compensate, as far as possible, all those who have lost family members, their homes and their livelihoods."
"What has happened in Madeira has dramatically shown us the importance of strengthening cooperation and solidarity in the European Union as well as in the area of disaster prevention."
"It is important at this point to build a suitable financial framework for prevention that strengthens and makes use of mechanisms such as cohesion policy, rural development policy and regional policy, amongst others, in order to assist Member States in the implementation of measures to protect people, the environment and the economy."
"Mr President, I would like to express the sorrow felt by all members of the Committee on Regional Development at the terrible loss of life in Madeira and our intention to do all we can to assist Madeira in its hour of need."
"Of course, the national and regional authorities are already doing their utmost to relieve the difficulties encountered by the people and especially those who have been left homeless and we urgently await their request for European assistance through the European Solidarity Fund."
"I am sure it will be treated with the utmost expediency by all concerned."
"We ask the European Commission to mobilise all its resources and review with the Portuguese authorities how the ongoing European programmes can be adjusted to assist the region."
"Let me emphasise that the existing Solidarity Fund continues to have well-known limitations."
"Back in April 2005, the Commission adopted a proposal for the revision of the regulation, which was then adopted by the Parliament at first reading in May 2006."
"Despite the undeniable usefulness of a more flexible Solidarity Fund, despite the necessity of extending its ambit of operations to cover unforeseen man-made disasters and criminal acts as well as natural ones, the Council has been unable to reach a common position on the review of the fund since May 2006."
"In the light of the terrible events in Madeira, we see more clearly than ever that we need a Solidarity Fund which could effectively meet the challenges and allow the Union to deliver prompt and effective assistance when Member States suffer a disaster."
"I would therefore call on the Spanish Presidency to relaunch the process of amending the Solidarity Fund, proving in this way that the spirit of real European solidarity remains at the heart of the European project."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, disasters are, of course, also a consequence of global warming."
"We need to endeavour to deal with these developments, which we are faced with on an increasingly frequent basis."
"The question therefore arises as to whether assistance should not be provided from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, particularly to workers in Madeira, because many work places will, of course, have been destroyed, and whether we could not support the small and medium-sized enterprises in the reconstruction work."
"We could provide a significant amount of help to craftsmen and the services sector in particular."
"I therefore ask the Commission to examine whether resources from the Globalisation Adjustment Fund could not be made available immediately."
"(EL) Mr President, I, too, express my deepest regret at the biblical disaster which has hit Madeira and my undivided support for the Portuguese Government."
"I hope that the tragic outcome in terms of human lives lost and missing persons will not get any worse."
"The planet is sending us an SOS message."
"Climate change, in conjunction with frantic rates of land use and industrial development, demonstrate how vulnerable the environment is."
"The catastrophic floods in Germany in the past and in countries in Eastern and Central Europe and the fires in Greece have still left open wounds."
"Disasters definitely have no national borders."
"I therefore call on the European Commission to respond positively to the calls by the European Parliament for more energetic action at Community level in terms of preventing natural and man-made disasters and their impact."
"I also call for immediate support for the victims in Madeira."
"It is very important to have an effective Community policy and special emergency funding and a bundle of measures for immediately restoring damage without bureaucratic processes."
"My condolences to the victims' relatives."
"(PT) The families affected by the tragedy which Madeira is undergoing deserve our profound sympathy and all our solidarity as we pay our respects to the scores of dead and injured persons and the hundreds of displaced individuals."
"The message of solidarity and hope for the people of the Autonomous Region of Madeira after this terrible disaster requires quick measures and simplified and extraordinary procedures to help those whose lives and property have been destroyed."
"It is necessary to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, but it is also necessary to use all other funds possible via emergency measures that must quickly reach the families affected by this catastrophe so that the Autonomous Region of Madeira can quickly rebuild the entire affected area."
"At this time, the prime consideration is the need for swift implementation."
"(EL) Mr President, the tragic floods which hit the autonomous region of Madeira remind us that natural disasters caused by climate change, a lack of planning and infrastructures and a lack of information and readiness can develop into a human tragedy, as has happened here."
"I would also remind the House that, a few days ago, huge floods hit other areas of Europe, such as Bulgaria and the region of Evros in Greece, causing loss of properties."
"I would also remind the House that Directive 2007/60/EC requires the Member States to carry out a preliminary flood risk assessment for each basin and corresponding coastal regions in their territory by 2011."
"We have a duty to put pressure on national governments to ensure that the directive in question is taken up by the Member States."
"However, the European Union also has a duty - and I do not believe that anyone will disagree - to develop even more intensive action in the field of natural disaster prevention, in the field of the protection, in the final analysis, of human life."
"(ES) Mr President, sometimes it is due to fires, sometimes it is due to droughts and sometimes it is due to devastating floods such as this, but the south of the Union has become the most obvious and also the most unfortunate demonstration of the terrible consequences of climate change."
"If we had a European observatory, it would clearly show that this is the case, which is why combating climate change is so important."
"It is, however, also important that we now urgently provide assistance to Madeira in this tragedy, and the Commission is urged to act without delay, with the greatest of urgency."
"These are the occasions when the Union has to show that it is effective, that it is supportive and that it is close to its citizens, especially those who need it most."
"I, along with the Spanish Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, will support this resolution to help our dear neighbour Portugal, and Madeira."
"We urge the Commission to get alongside the Portuguese Government without delay, unreservedly and without skimping on resources, in order to alleviate the disastrous consequences of this tragedy as far as possible."
"Mr President, ever since I was a kid, my favourite cake was madeira cake and when I discovered there was a lovely island called Madeira, I have had an affinity with it ever since."
"So when I heard of the devastation last Saturday, my heart went out to the people there, particularly my friend, Nuno Teixeira, and the other Portuguese colleagues, because in my own area, we ourselves suffered from flooding just prior to Christmas."
"I was very pleased to hear both the words and the tone of the Commissioner in extending the hand of friendship to the people of Madeira at this terrible time for them, probably to be known from now on as Black Saturday."
"But, in the broader sphere, I think that we need to look at the criteria for triggering the Solidarity Fund."
"Basing it on 6.6% of GDP and EUR 985 million is too high because many of these tragedies are very local, although they can be very devastating."
"We need to look at that."
"However, in the short term, we will do what we can for Madeira and I welcome the Commissioner's statement to that effect."
"(SK) On behalf of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, I would like to express solidarity with the inhabitants of Madeira and to express the firm belief that European aid for those affected will come more quickly in this case than it did for Haiti."
"I would like to believe that both the European Commission and the Portuguese Government will respond more effectively to the natural disaster in Madeira than in previous instances."
"I would also like to support my fellow Members who are demanding improvements in the mechanism for providing EU aid in cases of natural disasters so that the aid can be provided effectively and rapidly."
"(PT) I would also like to offer a message of support to the families and friends of the victims of the tragic events of Saturday on the island of Madeira."
"As an Azorean, a Portuguese and a European, I must appeal to Parliament and to the Union for a demonstration of active solidarity with the Autonomous Region of Madeira and its people."
"It is in the regions that the presence of the EU needs to make itself felt and it is precisely at such times, when solidarity is more necessary than ever, that it is most important that it makes itself felt."
"(DE) Mr President, firstly, allow me to express my heartfelt sympathy for the victims and the families affected."
"In Austria, we have a simple saying: he who provides help quickly provides twice as much help."
"That should not be an issue."
"We need to quickly find the funds from which to make the resources available and get help to those affected without delay."
"Analyses will also be necessary."
"As someone who lives in a mountainous region, I understand very well what happened here."
"Similar mistakes were made here to those made in our country."
"We carried out alignment work and hydraulic engineering work without taking nature into account, and out of small streams and channels, great rivers came."
"I watched these events, which were also the order of the day in Austria two or three years ago, with horror, in other words, with heartfelt sympathy and understanding."
"Immediately after the clean-up, after the damage limitation, we need to work together to rectify these mistakes."
"We offer our help in doing this."
"We received international help when we suffered our major avalanche disaster in GaltÃ¼r."
"International help was needed to enable us to evacuate a whole village and to rescue the people and fly them out."
"This is an appropriate time to send out a positive signal and to show international European solidarity, and I for one am prepared to do what I can to help in this regard."
"(PT) I also wish to express my solidarity with the pain of the people of Madeira and implore the European institutions, particularly the Commission, to release all the available resources and do everything within their power to provide this assistance."
"I would also like to emphasise that when misfortunes of this type occur, it is much more difficult to address their consequences if they occur in poor countries and poor regions."
"In the case of Madeira, however, we must also take account of the fact that the economic base of Madeira has been affected due its dependence on tourism, so it has suffered a double blow."
"Its natural beauty, access routes and quality of life have been completely destroyed."
"Therefore, the situation really is different when we have problems of this severity in poor countries and poor regions, especially in mountainous and tourist regions, as in the case of Madeira."
"It is therefore absolutely essential that there is no more waiting for all the adjustments to the Solidarity Fund that have been requested and proposed, and which have been brought up again here."
"They must enter into operation immediately because, given climate change, these events will unfortunately occur again and again, particularly in the poorest regions of Europe, as they are the ones that experience torrential rain and extreme drought during the summer."
"Member of the Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to you here in Parliament about the floods in Madeira."
"You have made an impressive appeal to the Commission to assist Madeira in its current situation and to show a sign of European solidarity."
"The Commission is prepared to do that."
"Precisely how it can do that will need to be worked out in the next few days and weeks in close cooperation with the Portuguese authorities."
"We must, and will, observe the rules of the Fund."
"Where they provide some leeway, the Commission will use that for the benefit of Madeira."
"First of all, the damage needs to be assessed and then an application for assistance has to be drawn up and submitted."
"That is the order in which things need to be done."
"The Directorate-General for Regional Policy and my colleague, Commissioner Hahn, will provide advice and support in this regard."
"Mrs Estrela called for the further development of the key directive and the rules of the Fund."
"More than four years ago, the Commission presented a proposal in this regard, which Parliament supported."
"It is currently still with the Council."
"However, by way of qualification, I would like to say that the proposals that we made at that time would not provide any better opportunities for assistance in this particular case."
"It is right that prevention must remain an area of focus for our policy."
"Cohesion policy is therefore precisely the right instrument to use."
"I would like to assure you once again that the Commission will do everything in its power to help the people and the administration in Madeira to cope with this terrible event."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the March I part session."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (PT) I wish to express my profound sadness and offer my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims of the natural disaster which has struck Madeira."
"I wish to express my solidarity with all the people of Madeira, its institutions and regional government."
"I am calling for the solidarity of the institutions of the European Union in terms of the swift and flexible application of the Solidarity Fund, especially in assigning the maximum possible amount of funding, bearing in mind Madeira's special status as an island and an outermost region of the EU."
"I call on the European Commission to apply the Structural Funds - the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund - on the basis of swift and simplified procedures."
"I also appeal to the goodwill of the European Commission to negotiate the reallocation of the Structural Fund resources with the competent authorities on the basis of the Community framework, taking this disaster into account."
"in writing. - (PT) I would like to express my profound sympathy and solidarity with the people of Madeira, their institutions and the regional government in view of the tragedy of force majeure which occurred on 20 February in the Autonomous Region of Madeira and which caused several dozen deaths, disappearances, displaced persons, injuries and huge material damage."
"This situation requires rapid and effective measures of solidarity from the EU."
"Hence, it requires the greatest possible promptness of all those involved in the allocation of the Solidarity Fund, so that it can be mobilised without delay."
"It is also crucial that the various funds of the European Union be mobilised in a flexible manner, through advance payments, simplified procedures and a higher rate of cofinancing in order to meet the needs of the Autonomous Region of Madeira."
"We advocate that the Solidarity Fund should be revised in the manner that has already been requested by Parliament."
"This fund must function as an emergency fund in which lead times are much reduced and the sums made available are increased."
"I would like to offer my condolences to the families of those who have died as a result of the floods and landslides caused by heavy rain on Madeira."
"Nature cannot be cheated, and since we cannot prevent natural disasters, we should do everything to prevent their destructive effects and come to the assistance of their victims."
"In the face of natural disasters and other crisis situations, the European Union should be able to react rapidly and efficiently by using appropriate resources."
"In relation to this, as I have already stressed in amendments submitted relating to the draft report of Mr Danjean on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the Common Security and Defence Policy, it is essential to ensure the efficient functioning of instruments for reacting to crisis situations by good organisation of command centres, appropriate to the needs of action taken as part of the first and second pillars."
"Good planning and efficient management of these centres will allow successful action to be taken on the territories of European Union Member States and of other states which need help."
"In particular, better coordination of rescue, police, military and fire-fighting forces is needed in the EU."
"Use of specially trained units, like the Polish Search and Rescue Group of the National Fire Service, which holds UN certification, should be taken into account."
"Investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Adina-Ioana VÄlean, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No 736/96 - C7-0125/2009 -."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I fully appreciate your presence in the plenary this evening."
"I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for our fruitful discussions and our work on this report."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is giving the European Union more competence in the field of energy policy."
"I believe this is an area where, if Member States work together, Europe can ensure secure, cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens."
"Together, we can minimise the impact of unpredictable events, such as the gas disruption Europe experienced last winter."
"Of course, Europe cannot interfere in gas flow outside its borders or solve such disputes, but what we can do is ensure that our infrastructure is able to cope with supply shortages or failures, and make the market more transparent and efficient."
"Europe has set this priority very high on its agenda."
"Last year, we adopted a third energy package which aims to ensure a more competitive and efficient energy market."
"A regulation on the security of gas supplies is currently on the table in Parliament and tomorrow's vote on the regulation on notification of investments in energy infrastructure will contribute to making the market more transparent and more predictable."
"In this context, I think it would be a pity to waste the opportunity this new instrument offers, by not applying the correct legal basis provided by the new Article 194 of the Lisbon Treaty."
"It is a very important institutional, political and legal point."
"This regulation is not only a tool for collecting information; it can also give an overall picture of investments in energy infrastructure as a basis for policy making."
"So, in the event that the Council adopts this regulation on the wrong legal basis, I consider that Parliament should pursue this matter further at the European Court of Justice, and let me assure you, it will."
"On the substance now;"
"I have said this before to Mr Barroso and I will say it again to you, Commissioner Oettinger: Europe is standing at a turning point and our priority now should be more than ever to support our companies and create a positive environment for competitiveness."
"We therefore need strong policies and especially a stronger reliable energy policy."
"The aim in the end is to ensure secure and cheap energy for both our citizens and our companies."
"In this perceptive, I should hope that gathering data will not become a purpose in itself."
"We have to make sure that this regulation will not create yet another bureaucratic burden on companies and that confidentiality of commercially sensitive information will be reinforced."
"On another issue, I can only regret that the PPE and S&D Groups introduced an amendment requiring EU companies to provide data on investments in projects in third countries."
"I challenge anyone to find the legal basis in the treaties that would allow extra-territoriality in energy policy."
"Furthermore, I believe we should first start proving that we know what is planned at European level before looking outside our borders."
"I have also noticed the temptation in this House to include everything in this regulation."
"I think that this is a mistake."
"For this instrument to be efficient, we must focus on real consistent information and keep in mind avoiding too much bureaucracy and confidentiality issues for our companies and the Commission."
"I have tried to achieve this balance by, on the one hand, giving the Commission the opportunity of having an overview of possible future developments but also, on the other hand, ensuring that this picture is as accurate as possible."
"We also need some certainty about future investments to ensure proper and solid policy making."
"I would also need to be reassured, Commissioner Oettinger."
"I want to avoid a situation where the Commission, having gathered the data, starts imposing investment plans and ends up telling companies not to invest here but there."
"However, it should provide solutions and incentives for companies to make short-term non-profitable investments which may be needed to ensure security of supply, otherwise the loopholes will remain."
"I am stopping here."
"Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing your comments."
"Madam President, Mrs VÄlean, honourable Members, the gas crisis at the beginning of last year showed us how important it is for Europe to have an energy infrastructure in place that not only promotes the functioning of the internal market, but that also enables solidarity between the Member States and the regions affected in the event of a crisis."
"It is therefore important for the Commission to get an overview of what new investment projects are planned or are under construction and which old installations are to be permanently taken out of service."
"Thus, our proposal is to develop and rework an information instrument that originated at the time of another crisis, namely, the first oil price crisis."
"This proposal aims to extend the area of application of the regulation, in particular, in the areas of renewable energies and CCS."
"We welcome the proposals that have come from within Parliament to include areas of application such as district heating networks or gas, coal and oil production capacities."
"We also want to take account of existing reporting obligations, provided the information available within the context of the analyses that are to be carried out by the Commission is useable."
"(Loss of sound)"
"We would like to try again and see if it works with the German."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I raised the issue of how the Commission wants to evaluate the information that it obtains from the Member States in the context of this regulation."
"Our analyses will firstly look at the anticipated development of the infrastructure in terms of the expected changes in demand."
"We will consider whether the new capacities that are expected will match the forecasts of future demand or whether we can expect shortfalls."
"In this regard, unlike in the current regulation, it would seem important for institutional talks on these subject areas to be introduced."
"The Commission therefore proposes, firstly, to publish a report every two years on structural developments in energy infrastructure."
"This is intended to help to improve transparency for all market operators."
"Secondly, we also want a political debate with Parliament and the Member States in order to draw conclusions from this."
"I would like to emphasise that last point, because one thing is clear: the regulation itself is an instrument for collecting and gathering information in order to show us if any action needs to be taken."
"How we go about this needs to be dealt with in the context of specific energy policy initiatives."
"This brings me to the point, Mrs VÄlean, that is of interest to you and to the entire House, namely the new Article 194 of the Treaty of Lisbon and its application."
"For all of us - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - this article represents both an opportunity and an obligation to shape EU energy policy in close cooperation - in other words, together with the European Parliament in particular."
"As the new Commissioner for Energy, I would therefore like to involve this House extensively in all future policy measures as far as possible and at an early stage."
"However, the legal act to which today's debate refers only concerns the collection and evaluation of information in the energy sector and therefore is based, according to the Commission's interpretation, on Articles 337 and 187 of the Euratom Treaty."
"The content of the regulation complies with both of these articles of primary law and, in accordance with case law, the choice of legal basis for secondary law must be linked to measurable criteria relating to content."
"No energy policy is established by the collection and evaluation of information alone, which is why, in my view, a decision is needed here."
"I beg your indulgence in this regard."
"Commissioner, you have attempted to explain the reason why we are not working on a codecision basis."
"I, too, remain of the same view as my fellow Member, Mrs VÄlean, the rapporteur for this report, that it would have been a good idea for this regulation to be discussed on a codecision basis."
"The new regulation is a legislative instrument of paramount importance to the European Union energy market."
"This analysis should supplement national and regional strategies and help consolidate energy security by identifying potential loopholes and risks in terms of infrastructure and investment, with a view to ensuring a balance between supply and demand in the energy sector."
"I think that the Commission's proposal contains a number of points that are unclear, but which I believe have been resolved through the amendments tabled, such as the issue of publishing energy data sent by Member States."
"This data needs to be aggregated at national and regional level."
"This helps prevent the disclosure of commercially sensitive information."
"Another issue is the need to clarify what is meant by 'specific body' or a body entrusted with the preparation and adoption of EU-wide multiannual network development and investment plans in energy infrastructure."
"There is also the issue of avoiding the double collection of this data and determining when reports need to be submitted for a certain project, for instance, after the authorities have received the construction permit application."
"Another particularly important aspect is the issue of monitoring in third countries European investment which has an impact on the European energy market."
"I believe that investments made in third countries by both governments and national companies, which have a significant impact on the energy market, must be reported as part of this regulation."
"Madam President, European integration, security and energy solidarity require common management of investment in all Member States as part of a broadly-understood energy infrastructure and, in particular, of the transmission infrastructure."
"Optimal solutions for investment in this area require objective information about the condition of the infrastructure in individual national systems, as well as information which is essential to carry out a central EU study of future integration."
"What is important is that the element of competition in the common market for products and services, which is influenced mainly by the cost of energy in each Member State, and the need to maintain trade secrets, should not obscure or disrupt integration processes."
"Let us keep secret only what must be kept secret - military infrastructure facilities."
"This is important, mainly because decisions taken about investments such as this, for example, the construction of a northern or southern gas pipeline, should not be exclusively egoistic measures taken in the interests of just a few EU Member States."
"Let us establish a complex, long-term energy infrastructure plan for the entire Union, based on the principles of cooperation, trust and solidarity."
"The current Regulation will, unfortunately, serve this end only to a certain degree and, in my opinion, it should, for example, also encompass the priorities of Member States."
"Madam President, I am extremely pleased to see the Commission's commitment to promoting best practice and improving energy efficiency in the European energy market."
"Energy efficiency is crucial for both jobs and growth in Europe and is essential if we are to achieve the 2 Â°C objective. The two main prerequisites in this context are smart energy grids and a free, well-functioning internal market in energy."
"Naturally, both these require the Commission to have a good knowledge of the current infrastructure and market - and that is what this proposal is about."
"We also need the bureaucracy that deals with this information to be efficient, however."
"We must avoid duplication and the information communicated must be that which is required to achieve the objectives set."
"If we are to achieve a functioning market, it is also incredibly important that the information gathered from European enterprises is protected, so as to avoid any disturbance of the market."
"I will be supporting the author's report and I call on the House to reject the incredibly bureaucratic proposals tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"As mentioned previously, the proposal's objectives are incredibly important - so important that they have been given a separate legal basis in Article 194 of the Treaty of Lisbon, in which they are practically listed word for word."
"The full participation of the European Parliament through the ordinary legislative procedure pursuant to this treaty should therefore be a matter of course."
"Anything else would not be worthy of us and would be an incredibly unfortunate start to the cooperation that we need between Parliament and the Commission for a functioning internal market in energy."
"Commissioner, it is good that you want to debate the result of this tool before the European Parliament, but the main thing to respect with regard to the European Parliament is the ordinary legislative procedure."
"We will find this tool useful, but it could be more operational, more effective and more transparent."
"More effective, in particular, if it took into account all the decentralised energy sources."
"It is not a matter of counting every single solar panel, but at Member State level we have information that you could gather to see what all the plans for decentralised energy add up to."
"When we are talking about democracy and transparency, I am surprised to hear our Liberal fellow Member reply 'bureaucracy'."
"This instrument must be transparent, it must be debated, and the Commission must consult all the stakeholders, unions and associations, among others. Finally, taxpayers are contributing a great deal to the energy transition effort, and it is important that we have information on funding, to know exactly how taxpayers are funding energy transition in Europe."
"I hope that the amendments that have been tabled will be adopted by a large number of Members tomorrow, by more than there are here this evening."
"The proposal for regular information on investment projects in the area of EU energy infrastructure is questionable."
"It will involve EU bodies in the area of competitive relationships between companies that are mostly privately owned."
"In my opinion, there are two layers to this proposal."
"One layer concerns the content of such mandatory information, particularly regarding its scope and details."
"The second layer concerns the level of confidentiality and the ensuing obligations of the Commission to maintain secrecy."
"I firmly believe that the information which has to be communicated should be of a more descriptive nature, giving a rough overview of energy networks and their future development."
"In this way, the Commission would have a sufficient overview of the links between individual countries and, at the same time, also a sufficient overview of existing networks and the outlook for the future."
"It also logically gives rise to the question of what the Commission would do if it was convinced that there was insufficient capacity in a certain area, or if, on the contrary, there was excess capacity."
"With a sufficient level of general information, we would also do away with the problem of awkward discussions concerning the maintenance of secrecy in relation to certain strategic plans of the energy companies."
"Events in recent years have shown us that the energy security of the EU is more a wish than a reality."
"The energy systems of the EU Member States are neither sufficiently compatible nor sufficiently interlinked."
"That is why many countries found themselves in a situation without heat and gas at the start of last year, despite all the solidarity and goodwill of the EU."
"It will take extensive initiatives from the European Commission to correct this situation, and it is therefore necessary for the European Commission to be informed in its work in a qualified and detailed way, both by Member States and by the private sector."
"For these reasons, we may regard the draft Council Regulation concerning the notification of investment projects in energy infrastructure as a natural and necessary step in the extension of EU energy policy, responding to current developments in the field of energy supply in the EU."
"The amendment proposals included in the report on this point of the programme improve the wording of the regulation and I therefore consider it right to support them."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the excellent report by Mrs VÄlean makes some sensible points with which I agree."
"Firstly, the requirement to guarantee an optimum level of security with regard to the data and the information requested under the proposal, namely that which economic operators regard as sensitive data."
"Secondly, the requirement to provide for the possibility of aggregating data at a broader regional level as well, given that the national level is sometimes of no significance."
"Thirdly, notification should have a practical purpose and should complement the analysis of the development of the European gas system."
"For this reason, the Commission should be obliged to discuss its analyses with the Member States and with operators in the sectors; this is a commitment that the Commission made here with us."
"We must also successfully avoid a duplication of the work that operators, national regulatory authorities and Member States have to undertake in order to define the national plans aimed at protecting the security of supply, with specific reference to the gas infrastructure, and also guarantee that, if operators decide to change their investment plans, they are not penalised in any way."
"I shall conclude by drawing attention to Article 1(2) of the proposal, in which the time limits of notification are discussed."
"The fact that many projects do not go beyond the planning stage must be taken into account."
"The best possible result could therefore be achieved if notification concerned only those projects that have obtained the necessary authorisations and permits or those for which a final investment decision has been taken."
"(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on the fine job she has done."
"The Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the European Union's powers in the area of energy policy."
"EU energy security and solidarity between Member States in energy crisis situations are vital to the European Union's energy policy."
"The present regulation sets out a Community framework for notifying the Commission about data and information on investment projects in the energy infrastructure for oil, gas, electricity and biofuels, as well as on the projects involving the geological storage of carbon emitted in the energy sector."
"In fact, the Commission will be able to submit proposals on how to make better use of existing capacities and identify solutions in energy crisis situations."
"The regulation must not significantly overload the administrative burden which energy companies have to deal with."
"However, I believe that this regulation should also be applied to European companies which invest in energy infrastructure projects in third countries and are directly linked to the energy networks of one or more Member States or have a significant impact on them."
"This is why I hope that Amendment 74 will receive majority support tomorrow."
"Madam President, some of the amendments that we are considering tonight reflect our manic obsession with renewables."
"We continue to talk about the importance of reducing CO2 emissions, even while the theory of man-made global warming is falling apart in front of our eyes."
"But if we were serious about reducing CO2 emissions, surely we should be favouring nuclear power stations and not renewables."
"We have chosen to put in place incentives that grossly distort the market in favour of renewables and against nuclear power."
"Europe needs competitive, reliable, mainstream, base-load, generating capacity which nuclear power can deliver."
"In the meantime, the pathetic trickle of intermittent electricity from wind farms cannot be relied upon to power Europe's industries."
"Many countries in the EU, including my own, are facing the prospect of an energy crunch later this decade, partly as a result of the Large Combustion Plant Directive."
"Unless we get on and build serious generating capacity, by which I mean nuclear and coal, then we will find ourselves with the lights going out."
"(PL) The question of energy and the energy network is a crucial issue for the future of the European economy."
"The significance of energy security is repeated in a variety of documents, debates and meetings."
"However, in order for words and declarations to be followed by specific solutions and measurable effects, we should first and foremost ensure an appropriate level of financing for investments which are being planned."
"According to a report produced by Exxon Mobil, one of the world's largest fuel corporations, world demand for energy is going to rise by around 1.2% annually, so that by the year 2030, demand will have risen by approximately 35%."
"The requirement for gas, which will be the second most important energy source, is going to rise by 1.8% annually."
"Currently, the world uses a little over 3 billion m3."
"In 2030, it will need around 4.3 billion m3."
"A consequence of Europe's growing need for gas will be an increased dependence on imports of this resource, from 45% in 2005 to 70% in 2030."
"In view of these figures, financial support from the European Community for the energy network should be treated strategically."
"In the present economic and financial situation, it is especially difficult to find investors for many projects."
"Only appropriate support from the European Union will enable these projects to be continued."
"Priority should be given to those projects which concentrate on cross-border needs and contribute to the development of new technologies which are of fundamental significance for the future energy needs of Europe."
"These projects will help eliminate differences in connections between systems in the European Union, and will make possible further optimal use of the European Union's own sources of energy."
"Madam President, this question is a very important for at least three reasons: firstly, we must think about energy security, because the day is going to come when fossil fuels run out; secondly, our climate change targets for 2020 or, as some people have advocated, 3020 or even 4020; and thirdly, and very importantly, we must reduce our reliance on fossil fuels that come from sometimes unstable and dictatorial regimes."
"So time is not on our side and one of the areas which requires grave attention is that of research and innovation."
"And I am worried about duplication in that area."
"I learned recently there were 45 different groups doing research into salmonella bacteria."
"Now, if this could happen with salmonella bacteria, you could have 450 groups doing the same research into renewable energies, for example, wind energy, solar energy, tidal energy and wave energy."
"So I want to ask the Commission what plans they have to coordinate this research so that the best use is made of resources in terms of getting the technology we need."
"(RO) I wish to congratulate Mrs VÄlean for this report."
"I would like to highlight some aspects regarding the importance of infrastructure investments."
"Continuous development of the energy infrastructure is the only way to cope with an ever-changing society."
"The development of existing networks, along with investment in new types of networks adapted to innovative energy resources, is a vital factor intended to facilitate access to new energy sources, both for the population and industry."
"At present, regional cooperation occurs de facto in the energy sector."
"However, it needs to be reinforced with clear regulations."
"Solidarity between Member States must be translated from an idea into reality."
"Increasing investment in IT systems for monitoring and reporting on fuel stocks during a crisis is also important."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise that investments and the deployment of ICT solutions in the energy sector are key to the development of an energy-efficient, low carbon economy."
"(SK) The Lisbon Treaty, which has strengthened the powers of the EU in the field of energy policy, should be actively exploited in order to overcome difficulties and prevent possible problems on the energy market."
"The provision of information on investment projects within the energy infrastructure will help to identify gaps between supply and demand in this sector, and will therefore also contribute to the creation of a better common energy policy in the spirit of solidarity, bringing the Member States closer together on the energy market."
"For the aforementioned reasons, I agree with the view that it is necessary to gather precise and adequate information on planned investments, in order that the EU can make informed decisions on energy policy, based on an integrated picture and on the situation prevailing in all of the Member States."
"(PL) A guarantee of stable and uninterrupted energy supplies has become a priority for the governments of Member States of the Union, as it has for the Community as a whole."
"Special responsibility for this matter lies with the European Commission which, by its actions, should aim to secure energy supplies for the Community by developing and monitoring the correct functioning of the European energy market."
"One of the mechanisms of the Commission's multi-dimensional energy policy should be support for effective investment projects in the energy sector."
"The Commission should carry out regular analyses and research."
"The analyses should be based on information about investment projects in the energy infrastructure of individual countries, with an emphasis not only on facilities which are currently in use, but also on analysis of investment projects which aim to increase diversification, both of the sources of the raw materials for energy and the way they are transported and processed."
"When the Commission has similar analyses from all the countries of the Union, it will be able to select the strategy which is most advantageous for the European energy market."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, one of the key problems in the energy sector is, of course, the storage of energy."
"I believe that, in connection with the security of supply, we need to think more about the subject of storage."
"In connection with renewable energies in particular, this is an enormous challenge."
"On the other hand, we also need to create intelligent networks."
"The more renewable energy we have, the more chances we have of making our environment significantly more energy efficient with intelligent networks and, ultimately, also providing households with incentives to use intelligent metering to reduce consumption as well as costs."
"The increase in efficiency will play a very important and key role in future, not only in the production of energy, but also, and in particular, in the consumption of energy."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for your valuable suggestions for improvement."
"The Commission will take steps to ensure that many of your suggestions are taken into consideration by the Member States in the final version of the regulation."
"The Commission is aware of the confidential nature of the information relating to planned projects."
"For that reason, we agree with the suggestions of this House to publish only data that has previously been collected at Member State level."
"In addition, the data should be aggregated at European level in such a way that no inferences can be made about individual companies and their business policies."
"This is important in cases where there is only one company operating at national level in a particular energy sector."
"As I have already mentioned, we also welcome the extension of the area of application to cover oil, gas and coal production capacities."
"I do not wish to conceal the fact that the Member States are less favourably inclined towards this proposal, but promise to review the inclusion of these capacities within five years."
"Irrespective of our different interpretations with regard to the legal basis for the regulation, I can assure you that the Commission's aim is to have a broad debate in the area of infrastructure."
"The new infrastructure and solidarity instrument that is to be developed, which is intended to follow on from the Community financial aid to the trans-European energy networks, will provide the opportunity for this, as will the Commission's progress reports on the implementation of the economic recovery programme in respect of benefits to energy projects."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I should like to thank the Commissioner and colleagues for their interesting input in the debate."
"Just a few words in conclusion - or as my conclusion at least."
"First of all, I would like to stress again that policies should certainly abstain from interfering with the market."
"Let us not forget that Europe is a market economy and policies are only here to correct the market weaknesses."
"Secondly, my opinion remains firmly that we should not use this regulation to verify the correct application of other regulations or include exhaustive information; it is not an exercise in statistics."
"We must definitely keep the information gathered to a certain degree of relevance, otherwise it will lose its purpose under a massive amount of data."
"And this regulation is not about devising a policy on renewables or gas."
"Finally, I would like to say to my colleague, Lena Ek, that I only hope the aggregated data that we have as a result of this regulation will help us to become smarter in energy issues and will be in our general interest."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 February 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I congratulate the European Commission on having submitted to the Council the amended regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union."
"The report enriches the contents in a meaningful and up-to-date way, and does so for two reasons."
"The first reason is to provide transparent information on the security and confidentiality of the sensitive data that the Commission will have to receive periodically in order to manage energy policy effectively."
"The report is in line with the Treaty of Lisbon, in which particular attention is paid to energy policy by means of the strengthening and coordinating of its methods and of the investments required for the sector."
"The Copenhagen Summit's failure to satisfy the world's political leaders means that the policies to be pursued require a change of strategy."
"The European Parliament is paying particular attention to the problem with the aim of overseeing energy investments in the construction, transport and storage of associated energy products, so as to satisfy the production and distribution industries and hence safeguard consumers' health."
"The second reason is that, since the EU has a shortage of energy products and internal demand - like imports - is growing every day, EU energy policy must focus on diversification, security of supply and energy efficiency."
"The principle of solidarity must provide the platform for devising the European Union's energy policies."
"If Member States work together, they can ensure a more secure, cheaper and more efficient supply of energy resources to citizens and companies."
"It is of paramount importance for the European Union to have an energy infrastructure which facilitates cooperation between Member States in order to reduce the problems which crop up during energy crises."
"This regulation will provide the European Commission with information about energy structures so that it can obtain an overview."
"This includes data about oil and natural gas infrastructures, as well as for renewable energy sources."
"After collecting this information, it will be possible to highlight deficiencies in the European energy system and then propose measures to rectify them."
"Measures taken at European level must supplement national and regional strategies."
"I believe that it is extremely important for us to protect the confidential nature of the commercial information which is gathered."
"Furthermore, it is also important to monitor those European investments in third countries which have a major impact on the EU energy market."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a regulation on investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community is an important instrument for promoting an EU-level energy policy effectively."
"I support the rationale behind this proposal, namely the need to define a consistent and comprehensive framework for the development of investment in energy infrastructure within the Union that will allow the Commission to monitor the state of development of the investment projects planned in the energy sector."
"Monitoring is certainly crucial to ensuring that the policy pursued in support of the projects is transparent, but this is on condition that the administrative burden placed on small and medium-sized enterprises - the driving force behind the EU economy - is reduced to a minimum."
"I consider it positive that a compromise has been reached to ensure that the data of operators in the market will be received and processed by the Commission with the necessary confidentiality guaranteed."
"Investment projects in energy infrastructure are crucial if a free and therefore competitive energy market is to be established."
"For this reason, I call on the Commission to provide periodically, on the basis of the data collected, an analysis of the structural development of the energy sector, with the aim of identifying any areas for improvement in the market and any obstacles that prevent it from functioning optimally."
"Not a day goes by without a Member State or big company announcing major investment plans in the energy sector."
"Various gas pipelines, off-shore wind parks and power stations by the dozen are at the drawing board stage."
"At the same time, coordination between future investments leaves a lot to be desired."
"This in itself would be more than sufficient reason to endorse the regulation on the table now, which would consolidate into a unified structure all energy investment notification obligations on the part of Member States."
"The regulation to be adopted makes it possible to harmonise regional investment and helps joint planning, thus strengthening the energy market and supply security."
"I think it is important for requirements in the proposal regarding notification of investments not to place an excessive administrative burden on the authorities of Member States."
"We have to ensure that the method for notification of investments corresponds to previously adopted rules."
"It is worth recalling in that regard that even now, the EU directives for the internal electricity and natural gas market call for preparing 10-year investment plans."
"The original proposal of the European Commission did not extend to investments in district heating."
"For this reason, the amendment including it among the areas of mandatory information provision, proposed by Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, should be endorsed."
"We must not forget that in new Member States, district heating plays a significant role in serving the population."
"In Hungary, for instance, this form of heating supplies some 2 million people."
"District heating investments cannot be left out of consideration during harmonisation of energy investment policies."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, In spite of the great uncertainties regarding the implementation of investment projects for energy industry infrastructures, added to the serious difficulties caused currently by the economic and credit crisis for investment plans in the energy sector, we must see clearly that the key factor in the new European energy policy, which is aimed at guaranteeing a secure supply while alleviating the effects of climate change and maintaining competitiveness, is to invest heavily in the coming years in energy industry infrastructures in the European Union."
"This is an important tool for shaping a common energy policy."
"Without sufficient information about our energy infrastructure, we cannot give effective support to the European energy policy at EU level."
"It is for this reason that I consider our mutual goal in the Community to be the provision of precise and regular information about investment projects in the EU energy infrastructure, the lightening of the burden of information gathering, the improvement of useful analysis based on information submitted to the Commission, while at the same time easing the burden on private sector players who perform an increasing role in investing in infrastructure development."
"I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for preparing such a balanced report."
"The consolidated efforts of the Member States and the European Commission, which are contained in the report, will ensure an integrated and improved system of energy security for the Union, while at the same time achieving better efficiency and reduced consumption of energy."
"As part of Community energy policy, the Commission and the Member States should identify investments which are necessary to meet the EU's strategic needs in terms of the supply and demand of natural gas and electricity."
"The regulation establishes common frameworks, on the basis of which the European Commission receives submissions of data and information on energy infrastructure investment projects in the areas of crude oil, natural gas, electricity, biofuels and low emission investment projects for urban heating and cooling systems."
"It is indisputable that one element necessary for maintaining stability in the energy system is, without doubt, coal, which must not be superseded by renewable energy sources, because they will not meet the needs of the continually expanding and developing economic sectors of the new Member States."
"In pointing to the advantages of coal as an energy source, it should be pointed out that the use of new technologies will allow us to achieve a greater reduction in pollution and gradual adoption of established CO2 emission limits."
"In the context of the new energy policy aimed at guaranteeing the supply of energy, alleviating the impact of climate change and ensuring competitiveness, energy infrastructure investments have a vital role to play."
"The new policy requirements such as targets for the fuel mix will alter Member States' policies so that they will benefit from a new, modernised energy infrastructure."
"The proposal from the Commission is to revise the current system of notification on energy investment projects."
"The aim is to gather suitable information on planned investments in order to enable the Commission to monitor the situation regarding the infrastructure and anticipate potential problems."
"Given that current EU legislation already imposes reporting and notification obligations in relation to investments and infrastructures, the use of this information must be better coordinated so that duplication of obligations such as reporting and confidentiality can be avoided, while also improving citizens' access to information."
"Even though the proposal mainly focuses on administrative matters, it gives an idea of the nature and characteristics envisaged for future investments."
"It is therefore important to put further emphasis on the environmental impact of the projects in order to provide guarantees and additional incentives for building and decommissioning energy infrastructures in a sustainable way and with due respect for the environment."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Coping with the rising demand for energy while at the same time protecting the environment, in particular, in respect of anthropogenic climate change, is one of the major tasks that the EU will have to deal with in the future."
"In this connection, it is extremely important for the European Union to be aware of all energy infrastructure projects in the Member States."
"This will increase the efficiency of the work to produce a European energy solution."
"The present text regarding the exchange of information on investment projects in energy infrastructure will provide a good overview of existing energy infrastructures in Europe."
"It goes without saying that this report must not provide an opportunity for data abuse."
"I therefore welcome the cross-party compromise, which lays down clear ground rules for the transfer of data."
"Central monitoring also enables early establishment of whether Europe is focusing too hard on a single energy source."
"Overall, the report represents progress towards a modern energy mix."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, until now, we have discussed the need to quickly draft a common EU energy policy only when a crisis occurs, like the one in the winter of 2009."
"We can say with justified concern that things cannot continue in this manner."
"This is why I welcome Mrs VÄlean's report and regard it as an important step towards creating a common European energy policy."
"It goes without saying that the adoption of a number of directives and regulations for the energy sector will create the necessary conditions for devising such a common policy."
"I think that we are close to the point where we can even start talking about an agreement on creating an EU energy community."
"The introduction of a notification system for investment projects in the energy sector in each individual Member State will enable the Commission to obtain the full picture of how the EU's energy infrastructure is developing, while also guiding the countries towards resolving the weakest, problematic areas."
"This will help achieve a satisfactory, reliable infrastructure capable of both supporting the operation of the internal energy market and alleviating the consequences of crises which occur."
"The most important fact is that a satisfactory common European energy infrastructure is a prerequisite for a common EU internal energy policy, which the European Parliament has insisted on in a number of its documents."
"Amending Budget 1/2010 (Section I, European Parliament) (debate)"
"We all know full well that it is only through joint efforts at the European level that we will manage to meet the greatest challenges of the 21st century, which are climate change, the risks and cost of raw materials and energy, economic globalisation and threats to our security."
"If Europe is to confront these problems, it must have effective and complex instruments at its disposal."
"The Lisbon Treaty will provide such instruments."
"In December, we approved the budget of the European institutions for 2010."
"For reasons connected with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty, our work on the budget was not completed in December and it will continue into April."
"Today we are in the initial stage of the treaty coming into effect, and the EU will need to have adequate funding at its disposal from the outset in order to implement the new policies."
"The Lisbon Treaty has an impact on the entire range of services of the European Parliament and other institutions."
"As far as the European Parliament is concerned, codecision making will increase dramatically, covering up to 95% of legislation."
"Areas such as freedom, security and justice, agriculture, fisheries, research and structural funds have been added."
"There will be greater use of qualified majority voting in the Council and the creation of a number of new legal foundations in areas such as tourism, sport, energy, civil defence, administration and cooperation."
"This will all increase the legislative activities of the EU generally, with a significant overall impact on the powers of the European Parliament and its activities, and therefore also on the need to strengthen the administration."
"The main priority of the amending budget proposed by the Presidency of the European Parliament in connection with the Lisbon Treaty is to ensure that the European Parliament has sufficient resources to perform its legislative role."
"Let us recall that the European Parliament set a limit on its own requirements back in 1988."
"It defined this limit as amounting to 20% of the overall administrative costs of the institutions."
"In 2006, in negotiations over the multi-year financial framework for 2007-2013, the European Parliament approved this limit as the maximum of the overall administrative costs of the institutions."
"Since 2006, the costs of the European Parliament have grown in connection with the Statute for Members, entering into effect, even though on the second page of the very same Statute for Members, funding is set aside in Member State budgets."
"Today, we also need to cover costs arising from the new role of the European Parliament in connection with the Lisbon Treaty entering into force."
"It has to be said that the spending limit of 20% did not take into account the Statute for Members or the Lisbon Treaty."
"In spite of the Statute for Members being in the Lisbon Treaty, we in the Committee on Budgets insisted on the European Parliament budget for 2010 adhering to the 20% limit from the original multi-year financial framework."
"We have also achieved this."
"When drafting the 2011 budget, however, we will have to set out the new formula carefully, in order to ensure the sustainability of the budget in the subsequent period."
"I would like to emphasise that the best way to ensure budget sustainability is to create a budget based on actual needs and not based on inflation indices."
"Only this approach will ensure that the budget reflects only actual needs, thereby increasing its transparency and efficiency."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (PT) This amending budget is a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Parliament has assumed new competences and new responsibilities, so it must have the means to rise to this new challenge."
"I would like to emphasise that European citizens demand excellent legislation from Parliament and, to secure this, it is important to provide its Members, committees and political groups with the necessary means."
"Legal and budgetary standards and good financial discipline are fulfilled in this amending budget."
"Furthermore, we believe that budgetary discipline and the pursuit of savings are needed more than ever, and European citizens also expect this, in the implementation of this budget."
"Therefore, we would like to reaffirm the importance of drawing up a zero-based budget which guarantees more rigour and transparency, and we also request information regarding the real fixed expenses of the European Parliament, as a matter of urgency."
"We also insist on the need for long-term planning in buildings policy, with a view to ensuring budgetary sustainability."
"We would also point out that we have reduced the buildings reserve by EUR 4 million."
"In this way, the total level of the budget now represents 19.99% of the initial heading, heading 5, which was adopted at first reading."
"We are certain that these measures will help us to be able to deal with the legitimate concerns, expectations and demands of European citizens."
"Madam President, this Amending Budget is primarily practical in nature, its purpose being to adapt Parliament's procedures to the new tasks that it has under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"One paragraph, however, is a point of principle; it concerns the decision that was made 20 years ago now that Parliament should not take more than 20% of the EU's administrative budget."
"This decision will result in us marginally exceeding this limit - but more as a result of technical changes than as a result of a new policy."
"However, this has given rise to debate concerning the 20% rule."
"Unless substantial cuts are made, the limit will be exceeded when today's decision has its full impact in 2011."
"There is good reason to discuss changing this 20% rule, since Parliament's role has changed more than that of other institutions, but we should not abandon this principle without due consideration."
"I am thinking mainly of two aspects."
"Firstly, we must consider the fact that many Member States are currently under extreme pressure to cut staff and salaries."
"In such a situation, we cannot continue expanding the EU administration regardless."
"Secondly, we must bear in mind that we allocate the EU's administration budget jointly with the other institutions and that in the 1988 decision, we promised that if we were considering abandoning the 20% rule, then this would only take place following dialogue with the Council."
"This is especially important in view of the difficult negotiations with the Council that are imminent in respect of the External Action Service, the Financial Regulation, the long-term budget, and so on."
"I am voting in favour of the report but, at the same time, I would like to sound a note of warning concerning the future."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon strengthens the EU as a whole."
"It strengthens the involvement of European citizens and it also strengthens the European Parliament."
"The increase in the status of the European Parliament also brings with it greater legislative obligations."
"These must be met by each individual Member to the best of his or her knowledge and belief."
"In this context, I would also like to mention the slogan of legislative excellence."
"My 'yes' to the amendment to the Parliamentary budget is conditional."
"In view of the ever worsening crisis, we need to manage our finances with greater care."
"However, as parliamentarians, we are also obliged to conduct our legislative work in the best way possible."
"This dual requirement must be met."
"(ES) Madam President, it is proof of the confidence that the Members of this Parliament have in the Committee on Budgets that we are voting for a substantial increase in Parliament's budget, including the Members' parliamentary assistance allowances, and the four or five members of the Committee on Budgets are practically the only people here."
"This is a good sign that they have confidence in us."
"However, the reason why there are two coordinators here from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is to confirm that we fully agree with this increase in the budget as we consider that it does not infringe the standards of austerity that we have imposed on ourselves."
"The European Parliament is a very special institution, as my fellow Member, Mr FÃ¤rm, is well aware."
"In Sweden or Spain, if we were continually increasing the size of our regions, the number of members of parliament we had and our functions, any Member State would need to increase its parliament's budget."
"This is what is happening to the European Parliament, and we therefore need to vote in favour of it."
"It is true that in the coming years, we will have to ensure that this expenditure is sustainable, and this will require us to talk seriously about buildings policy and about future policies for staffing and office equipment."
"All this will have to be considered in the future in the context of sustainability and effective spending."
"The Bureau of Parliament and the Committee on Budgets have adopted some dissenting positions, as the Bureau defends the needs of Members and we in the Committee on Budgets defend austerity and the budgetary reality."
"I think, however, that the agreement is a good one and that we will be able to adopt it tomorrow without any problems."
"Madam President, I speak on behalf of the S&D Group but most Members will recognise the need for extra resources after the Lisbon Treaty."
"However, there are a number of questions on the timing and the funding of these proposals."
"Colleagues have raised some of those issues."
"There are also other questions."
"For example, if we are to have extra staff resources, on what evidence is this based?"
"Were figures just plucked from the air?"
"Or, if it was based on evidence, I think we should have been given that evidence."
"Also, how will the extra staff for the secretariat be allocated?"
"I think we should have been given that information as well."
"I also think that, if we accept the extra assistance allowance of EUR 1 500 per month, we should also look at other costs, costs for extra office space which may be required."
"In fact, we should be given the global costs for that."
"This is going to be a difficult decision for Members tomorrow."
"It is always controversial when you are asked to give yourselves resources."
"If we had been given all the information I and my colleagues have been asking for, the decision tomorrow might have been easier for Members to take."
"(NL) Given the late hour at which we are discussing this, you might think that our own budget does not tolerate daylight."
"Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon obviously gives us more obligations, more powers and more work, but does that also mean that we need more staff across the board for committees, groups and individual members?"
"I have my doubts."
"I think that, if we want to be more politic and efficient in the way we work, we can best do that within the confines of the current budget."
"Finally, Madam President, there seem to be a number of steps that we need to take."
"We are not just talking about a one-off increase this year, because it appears that we will increase the budget next year as well, and my group is not in favour of that."
"If we now agree to an increase because of the Treaty of Lisbon, then this is the only occasion on which we can use that argument."
"As far as we are concerned, this has to be a one-off increase, not a further one next year and another one the year after."
"All that would achieve is to mean we would need more buildings."
"(RO) Legislative excellence is a priority for Parliament, and MEPs, committees and political groups need to be offered sufficient resources for achieving this."
"The new administrative expenditure incurred by implementing the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon is now included in Parliament's budget."
"In addition, the report also emphasises the importance of the extended legislative role which Parliament has and, therefore, the need for additional financial resources to satisfy this remit."
"Specific actions need to be taken to ensure a stable budget by drafting a zero-based budget policy and long-term planning for meeting Parliament's requirements in terms of buildings policy."
"I think that the overall reference for Parliament's budget should continue to be the original programming of the multiannual financial framework in order to ensure that its interests are safeguarded while also maintaining budgetary discipline."
"At the same time, I believe that the traditional 20% limit must be maintained and I must welcome that a consensus has been reached on not exceeding this limit in this case."
"I also support the idea that actions aiming to secure budgetary sustainability in future years should be taken, while reaffirming the importance of drafting a budget policy that will ensure greater rigour."
"I also believe that transparency is required, which therefore means providing clear information about the overall volume of fixed expenses in the European Parliament's budget."
"(DE) Madam President, at the end of the procedure, I would like to say that the European Parliament has dealt with this matter in a very responsible way."
"I would like to thank the Bureau in particular for finding a way to respect the upper limit of 20%."
"During an economic crisis, it is important for all of us to be as careful as possible with taxpayers' money, but nevertheless to ensure that MEPs are provided with good and efficient resources."
"The EUR 4 million savings on buildings should not prevent us from using the existing resources to make our building one of the most modern buildings in the world so that we can work as efficiently as possible for our citizens."
"At this point I would like to thank all of you, ladies and gentlemen, for your views and speeches, and also for seeking a solution within the committee."
"I would like to say that in the 2010 budget, we have established systemic measures that can bring financial savings and reduce the pressure on our spending limits."
"In October last year, we agreed at the conciliation procedure that an administrative audit would be carried out in the European Parliament this year in the INLO Directorate-General and the security service."
"The aim is to assess whether resources are being used in the best possible way."
"The audit results should be a point of departure for further progress and greater efficiency."
"I see further potential savings in the better use of our own resources within the interpreting services or in the area of teleworking."
"I am expecting up-to-date information from the European Parliament and the other institutions on how they plan to make use of temporarily unexploited resources, not only in the language services but also in rented office space, copying services, etc. I firmly believe that savings in the budget will be achieved through the medium-term strategy in the area of assets and buildings, which will contribute to the sustainability of the EP budget."
"The European Parliament administration will present the strategy to us in a few days' time."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my thanks once again for your cooperation and for your responsible attitude to this issue."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 25 February 2010."
"I would like to thank you all."
"My thanks also to our technicians and interpreters for eventually getting us through the evening."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I congratulate Mr Manka on his successful negotiations in view of the very tight framework for the 2010 budget."
"In addition to thoroughly justifiable and necessary adjustments to the personnel and building policies of the EP, there is the, in my opinion, thorny issue of the planned increase in the secretarial allowance by EUR 1 500."
"It is unfortunate that, for procedural reasons, it is not possible to vote separately on this, as the increase in the secretarial allowance for MEPs from May 2010 decided on by the Bureau is inappropriate at a time of financial crisis."
"It is certainly the case that, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has recently entered into force, Parliament will, overall, need extra capacity for legislative work, but after the introduction of the assistants statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof whatsoever that MEPs actually need more assistants."
"Furthermore, the 'purchasing power' of the additional money is very different in comparison in the individual Member States and this should also be taken into account in a report that is still to be drawn up on the results following the introduction of the new rules for MEPs assistants."
"In view of the current very limited space and working facilities in Parliament, it is also to be feared that the increase in the secretarial allowance by EUR 1 500 adopted today will already create the conditions for further increases, demands and future working facilities."
"In light of this, the German Liberal Party (FDP) in the European Parliament will abstain."
"This budgetary amendment provides a response to a real need."
"In the wake of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament's powers have increased substantially in a host of areas."
"The direct consequence of this expansion is a much larger volume of work, the quality of which must be to the highest legislative standard."
"It is not a case of us asking for money for ourselves, as alleged by the press."
"However, we need to provide the institution of the European Parliament with the necessary resources to meet European citizens' expectations of this forum."
"in writing. - (EL) I, too, should like to thank the rapporteur for his work."
"Without doubt, the increased powers granted to the European Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon enhance the role of the European Parliament considerably and formulate tangible and effective responses to the expectations of European citizens."
"At the same time, however, the increase in its range of activities has created additional requirements in terms of more personnel, both in the administration of the European Parliament and in the political groups and offices of MEPs."
"The amendment to the European Parliament's budget was not only expected, but was also necessary if we want the European Parliament to respond effectively to its new responsibilities, which further strengthen its democratic credentials."
"I would remind the House that a similar amendment was made to the Council's budget in order to meet its administrative requirements when the institution of President of the European Council was created and similar proposals to amend the European Commission's budget are expected."
"Approval of this amendment will allow both the administration of Parliament and the political groups and MEPs to respond better and more efficiently to the new requirements."

"(ES) Mr President, yesterday, because of the time it took to get through our work here in the House, there was no opportunity to mention the recent death of Orlando Zapata, which the Spanish delegation sincerely laments."
"He died after a long hunger strike."
"He is the first prisoner of conscience to die in Cuba in 40 years, and we are calling here for the release of all prisoners of conscience in Cuba and in the rest of the world."
"We would also like to express our solidarity with his family and with the Cuban people on their path to pluralism and development."
"This very sad occasion could act as a catalyst for a discussion aimed at positioning the relations between the European Union and Cuba, within a comprehensive bilateral framework providing for permanent, constructive dialogue on human rights, on an equal footing with the European Union's agreements with third countries."

"Green Paper on reform of the common fisheries policy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Maria do CÃ©u PatrÃ£o Neves, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy -."
"Permit me to address a few words to the group of 50 fishermen who should be entering the Chamber just now, and who are here to watch this debate and the vote on the report."
"I think I can speak for all my colleagues in the Committee on Fisheries, who have worked hard on this report, when I say that I am very happy that this day has arrived, the day on which the report is to be presented to Parliament and put to the vote."
"Why?"
"Because the common fisheries policy is one of the flagship policies of the European Union."
"It had a rather difficult start, having been formally launched in the 80s and undergoing its first reform in 2002."
"Today, we are aware of some of the main problems that were identified back then (I am referring to overcapacity, overfishing, and overinvestment that, it appears, was not equal across the whole EU), because these problems are still largely present today."
"This is the starting point for the reform, a reform that has to be broad and intensive, and which has long been awaited by the industry."
"Which direction should this reform take, according to the content of our report?"
"Firstly, in terms of basic principles, there needs to be a balance between environmental, social and economic aspects."
"Environmental aspects are needed to guarantee the conservation of stocks; social aspects to guarantee the advancement and dignity of the profession; and economic aspects to guarantee that the industry can generate income."
"Without these three aspects, we will not have any fisheries in the European Union, or, at least, there will be none that are sustainable and capable of developing, which is what we all want."
"How should these general principles, aimed at reducing fishing, making more profit and conserving stocks better, be implemented?"
"The report points out certain fundamental aspects: investment in decentralisation; promoting the empowerment of fishermen and the entire fishing industry to have decision-making powers; giving them greater involvement in managing fishing, which will also allow a policy of compliance and responsibility; the need to draw a distinction between small-scale and industrial fleets, with specific regulations for each; the need to appraise management models that are better adapted to different fishing areas and different types of fisheries; the importance of strengthening the market by fishing that is aimed at value-added products and increasing the first-sale price; linking subsidies with good practice; regulation of the modernisation of the fleet in terms of safety and hygiene; decisive development of aquaculture, which is ecologically sustainable within the European Union; and the development of other sectors involved in catching or processing fish."
"We should not forget to draw attention to the growing role of women in fisheries either, and the need to require that fishery products from third countries, which are imported to the EU, be subject to the same requirements as those of our producers."
"This means certification, labelling, traceability and, finally, the integration of fisheries into European maritime policy within the broader context of enhancing its capacity."
"Let me finish by saying that the work that we present here today is the product of a joint effort by all the members of the Committee on Fisheries, particularly the shadow rapporteurs, with whom we worked very hard, and also with the Commission, the Secretariat of the European Parliament, the advisor to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and other advisors to other political groups, and, of course, my office and my assistant for fisheries."
"The work that we are presenting here today represents a truly joint effort, and we hope that it will be adopted here too."
"Mr President, the Presidency also welcomes this debate in the European Parliament as it is an important contribution to the broad consultation procedure on the Green Paper, and the European Parliament's contributions should therefore be given serious consideration by the Commission when it draws up its legislative proposals."
"The Council is also going to examine carefully all of Parliament's opinions to enable it to subsequently examine and adopt the legislative proposals under the ordinary legislative procedure."
"The Green Paper of April 2009 looks at various structural constraints in the common fisheries policy: overcapacity, lack of precise objectives, adoption of short-term decisions, lack of responsibility in the sector and poor compliance in general."
"The Green Paper also set out possible ways of combating these structural constraints and looked at important issues such as the differentiated regimes for industrial fleets and small-scale coastal fleets, waste, relative stability, transferable individual rights, greater orientation towards the markets, integration of the common fisheries policy into the broader maritime policy context, public financing and the external dimension of the CFP."
"The Member States, both individually and jointly in the Council, are studying in detail all aspects of the questions concerned."
"The first consultation phase ended in December 2009 and the Commission has received 1 700 proposals and held more than 125 meetings and seminars to date."
"The second phase, which will begin on 1 September of this year, will analyse the contributions made and discuss the main ideas."
"In January, the Commission organised seminars on the key elements of the reform and on rights-based fisheries management, and even today there is a seminar on small-scale fishing."
"The impact assessment will be conducted in March."
"The European Fisheries Fund and the future financial perspective will be dealt with in April, followed by the external dimension in May, and waste and selectivity in June."
"On 2 and 3 May, the conference being organised jointly by the Presidency and the Commission will be held in La CoruÃ±a."
"It will deal with three fundamental elements of the reform, namely governance, stock management and the differentiation between large-scale and small-scale fisheries."
"On 4 and 5 May, the ministers will meet in Vigo to examine the results of the conference, and it is possible that the June Council will include in its agenda an informal debate on a working document concerning possible changes."
"In the third phase, as I said before, which will begin in the second half of 2010, the Commission will present a White Paper and, subsequently, four legislative proposals: the basic regulation, the new COM, technical measures and the new regulation on financing."
"The objective is for the CFP to enter into force, with the new reform, on 1 January 2013."
"The Council has yet to adopt a position in this respect; it will only adopt formal decisions on the basis of the legislative proposals it receives from the Commission in 2011, and it will do so in accordance with the rules on the ordinary legislative procedure."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, since this is my first speech as a Commissioner to the Members of this House, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the European Parliament."
"I feel very honoured to be here with you and discuss the reform of the common fisheries policy, which is a core issue for the whole sector."
"I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Neves, on her hard work in bringing together different positions into a consistent document."
"I could not agree more that we need radical reform to turn around the structural failings of our policy."
"As you all know, the last reform in 2002 was not sufficiently successful."
"Now we have to tackle all the past deficits, to achieve better results from an environmental, social and economic aspect."
"The public consultation has shown clearly that there is broad support for this reform."
"Of course, I will not be able to respond today to all issues raised in your report, which is due to be voted on."
"However, I bear in mind your compromise amendments on sustainability, over-capacity, small-scale fisheries, horizontal decentralisation, phasing-out of discards, new fisheries agreements and deployment in the fishing sector."
"I am very thankful for your constructive input."
"I would like to highlight two specific issues: first, public funding."
"I believe we have to focus our subsidies to achieve better results by steering them towards the objectives of our policy."
"For example, instead of supporting the building of new vessels, we should support innovation for selectivity and greening and help producer organisations respond to the future challenges."
"Secondly, I share your views on the social dimension: we want a fishery which creates attractive and safe jobs."
"Today I am looking forward to hearing your proposals during this debate."
"Let me also inform you of our next steps."
"We will prepare a summary report on last year's consultation which will help us prepare the proposals for the new policy."
"We are organising workshops to discuss specific topics with stakeholders, the institutions and the Member States."
"Together with the Spanish Presidency, a broad conference of CFP reform will be held in May."
"I know, and it has already been mentioned, that there is a technical workshop taking place in the Commission at this very moment, with participants from all over Europe."
"I am sorry that you cannot attend this workshop."
"This workshop was organised a long time ago."
"I will try, if at all possible, to make sure that meetings do not clash in future."
"On the basis of this input, in late 2010, we will start to develop our proposals to be adopted in the Commission in spring 2011."
"This large consultation process will culminate in a very fruitful discussion with you."
"You, as colegislators, will then have a major role to play in shaping the new policy together with the Council."
"I am really looking forward to cooperating with you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the Council for its comments, and I would like to thank and wish the best of luck to the new Commissioner - who is making her debut today in this House - for the work that we are preparing to carry out."
"I believe that what we are implementing is important, and I hope that this Green Paper, which we are beginning to discuss today and which we will vote on later, does not end up as it did in 2002."
"Today, however, the European Parliament finds itself in a different position."
"We have the ordinary legislative procedure and the Treaty of Lisbon, and therefore I believe that we will all have to take advantage of them in order to meet the objectives."
"The key points have been described by our rapporteur, Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves, to whom we, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), express our gratitude for the work she has done, for the summary she has been able to present and for everything she has been able to outline."
"I merely wished to take the floor and to take advantage of this opportunity so as to broach the subject of fisheries, but by going beyond the normal Green Paper - and the White Paper that has been announced for June - and addressing the needs that exist in relation to Europe's seas, and to the Mediterranean in particular."
"Today we need to set ourselves rules that we have already been imposing on our economy and on our fishermen for a number of years."
"However, coastal states, even those bordering Europe, have wilfully and often, indeed very often, ignored these rules, and we find ourselves in the paradoxical situation in which all this is imposed on our fishermen, while the others can do as they like."
"Today, the European Commission has a different and more powerful role; it has a Minister for Foreign Affairs and a more powerful Parliament."
"My hope is that, within the Green Paper, and before embarking on the White Paper, we can work with third countries - those countries that are not part of the Union - in order to come up with shared and common rules to ensure that those who are subject to the rules do not feel betrayed or ignored by the Union and do not view the Union as an enemy rather than as a friend."
"Thank you, Mr MartÃ­n Fragueiro, welcome, and thank you, Mrs Damanaki."
"I, too, am speaking here for the first time on the topic of fisheries, and indeed we are facing a significant challenge in this area."
"We are obliged, and it is our responsibility, to define the guidelines that are going to guarantee the sustainability of the seas, fisheries and, in short, the planet itself."
"We are also talking about an important element of production in our countries, at our coasts, in our regions - an economic and cultural element that encompasses many values - and as you quite rightly said, Mrs Damanaki, there are problems with the 2002 reform."
"We need to revise the principle of relative stability and we need to look for new approaches to management that are more flexible and more adaptable because there have been problems with the TACs and quotas."
"There have been problems because of the all-too-familiar discard issue, discards that we cannot allow for the sake of our fishermen or for the sake of our planet."
"The future reform of the CFP must ensure a sustainable fishing system and we are in favour of a new management system based on fishing effort."
"We have to be more open, we have to think about things and we have to try to make management more flexible."
"We need to ensure widespread introduction of environmental criteria and differentiate between coastal fishing and deep sea fishing."
"This is important and it is something that the entire sector wants."
"We need to reduce the overcapacity of certain fleets."
"We also need to finalise the common organisation of the market and work out how to stabilise the market and how to reconcile it with fish imports from third countries."
"The fight against illegal fishing, which has been criticised and which has been ineffective to date, needs additional resources, harmonised sanctions and international agreements based on principles of law, principles of human rights and principles of compliance with the agreements."
"A financial framework, which you said must produce better results, has to produce better results than the current policy."
"Above all, we need to think about the social dimension: we are talking about people and we have to ensure that they have dignity, have a sense of professionalism, are given professional recognition and have the economic capacity to survive."
"Of course, we must not forget about the integration of women, who represent the invisible side of the fisheries world."
"We must bring them to the forefront and make an extra effort for them."
"The reform of the fisheries policies is more than simply drawing up legislation."
"It means tackling an important part of the reform, from within the European Union, that is going to guarantee the sustainability of the seas, fishermen and part of the planet."
"As a result, we must be courageous in the face of the challenges, and being courageous means tackling a policy without any fear."
"We must leave our fears behind."
"We must tackle the situation head on and maintain the balance of the state, of the European Union and of the world."
"Mr President, for those of us who have worked hard on this Green Paper and the report, it feels extremely good to have now got as far as plenary."
"First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job."
"Our common fisheries policy needs to be reformed."
"For the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, it was important for the reform to be based on an ecosystem approach."
"The wording in this regard in the report is good."
"At the same time, we are facing a situation where serious problems need to be dealt with, like the discards, the enormous overcapacity that exists in some places and many other things besides."
"I am therefore pleased that we have been able to agree on measures to tackle these things in particular."
"Who really thinks that the EU's discard policy is justifiable?"
"I certainly do not."
"Another important issue is the regionalisation of the common fisheries policy."
"Where the situation is so different in different places in Europe, it is important that decisions can be made and applied at regional level."
"Another welcome reform is the intention to introduce a separate approach for small-scale coastal fisheries."
"These are also issues that we brought up in the ALDE Group report."
"As a Finn and someone who lives next to the Baltic Sea, I am also pleased about the statement relating to the possibility of taking measures to tackle oversized seal and cormorant populations, as this is one of the greatest threats to fisheries in the Baltic Sea."
"Finally, I would like to mention the fisheries agreement with third countries."
"It is important for our policy in this regard to go hand in hand with the EU's human rights policy."
"The agreement with Guinea is a good example of where Parliament voted against the agreement, and this points towards the route we should take in the future."
"I am very happy to see how far the reform has progressed."
"We have a good Green Paper and I am certain that we will have a much better fisheries policy from 2013 onwards."
"Mr President, Commissioner Damanaki, ladies and gentlemen, my eyes were opened to the EU's common fisheries policy and its destructive consequences in 2002, when, following a majority vote in the Swedish Parliament, Sweden decided on a unilateral ban on cod fishing for a year, but was prevented from implementing it by the European Commission."
"Despite the fact the Sweden intended to compensate its commercial fishermen for the ban and the fact that researchers in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea had recommended a total ban on cod fishing for a number of years and despite the fact that the various cod stocks along the Swedish coast had been wiped out or reduced by between 70 and 90%, the principle of the common fisheries policy was more important."
"If everyone else overfishes, Sweden must overfish too, according to the Commission."
"In other words, exploitation was mandatory for EU Member States."
"The last reform of the fisheries policy was completed in 2002 and it has not proved capable of tackling the difficult problems that the fisheries industry was already facing ten years ago, namely that far too many vessels that are far too efficient are competing for far too few, and increasingly fewer, fish."
"The last vessels to catch bluefin tuna were subsidised by the EU as recently as 2005 in the Mediterranean."
"Between 2000 and 2008, EU taxpayers shelled out EUR 34 million to build and modernise tuna vessels at a time when stocks were on the verge of collapse."
"A similar logic is in evidence in the Baltic Sea."
"In recent years, the Swedish Board of Fisheries has paid out EUR 5.4 million to scrap some of the largest tuna fishing vessels - the same vessels that were built with the aid of EU money."
"A radical reform of the fisheries policy is needed."
"We believe that all types of harmful subsidies must be stopped."
"EU vessels with tax-free fuel and access agreements provided by taxpayers are currently emptying African seas of vital food supplies and competing unfairly with African fishermen, while at the same time destroying ecosystems."
"Ahead of today's vote on the report on the Green Paper, I would call on all of my fellow Members to at least remove one bad paragraph from an otherwise largely excellent report."
"I am referring to paragraph 121, which states that the EU's external fisheries policy should defend European fisheries interests."
"I do not think that it befits the EU to pursue such a policy in 2010."
"Mr President, Mrs Damanaki, at the outset, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves for the effort she has put into the preparation of this report."
"Great determination is needed, as well as a sense of compromise, to create such a coherent document."
"This report is, however, only the basis for building future common fisheries policy, which requires thorough reconstruction and fundamental changes so that care for the natural environment can be reconciled with development of the historical heritage of fishing."
"The policy must be based on regionalisation, which will, itself, be based on the conditions prevailing in different regions."
"This will enable correct assessment based on opinions from within the fishing industry as well as scientific opinions, and the compromise which is adopted will ensure the fair and equal management of fishing."
"The new fisheries policy must stimulate development of the industry in a Europe which is engulfed in the crisis, but it is also necessary to pay attention to the predatory industrial fishing being carried out particularly in the Baltic Sea, where healthy and valuable fish are being turned into fish meal for use on poultry and cattle farms, and, in exchange, the toxic Far East panga arrives on the tables of Europeans."
"This is a blow aimed at sustainable European coastal fishing, an industry which should be accorded particular care."
"It also shows the necessity of establishing a rational and fair system of catches to replace the easily manipulated quota system."
"This is to give an equal chance to all fishermen in all countries of the European Union."
"The European Conservatives and Reformists endorse the report, in the hope that the current system will change."
"In its Green Paper, the Commission tries to establish a phased or unphased Community system of transferable fishing rights, or private property rights for access to the use of a public good, namely fish stocks."
"This proposal was rejected when the last reform was carried out, but ten years on, the Commission is back in charge, and it is the one predicting the inevitable consequences of privatising stocks: the concentration of activity by groups with greater economic and financial power and the destruction of a substantial number of small-scale, coastal fisheries."
"It is revealing that the countries that opted for this route, such as Iceland, now want to withdraw, as they are confronted with the adverse consequences and perversities of this system."
"Parliament should take a clear stance by rejecting this proposal."
"Incidentally, this solution is not any kind of guarantee that the sustainability of fish stocks will be protected, since the reduction and concentration of rights among a handful of operators does not necessarily mean a reduction in fishing effort, but simply the concentration of the exploitation of resources."
"Protecting the sustainability of resources requires other measures, such as guaranteeing a fair return within the sector."
"This in turn requires intervention in the market and improved marketing in the sector, improving the first-sale price, increasing pay for work by fishermen, reducing the margins of middlemen and promoting fair distribution of added value throughout the value chain of this sector."
"The reality of fisheries in the EU is complex and diverse."
"In these circumstances, the widely recognised importance of local government directly contradicts the institutional framework created by the Treaty of Lisbon, which sets out the conservation of marine biological resources as the sole remit of the European Union."
"We need management that is supported by scientific knowledge, and which takes account of the reality and specific features of each country, each fishing zone, each fleet, and the resources themselves."
"This means involving the fishermen in finding solutions and implementing them."
"This is very different from the mere decentralised implementation of a centrally defined policy."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I want to appeal to Commissioner Damanaki for sensitivity to Britain in the reworking of the common fisheries policy which seeks to include recreational sea angling in the regulation and control of sea fishing."
"I thought the whole point of quotas was to prevent diminishing stocks."
"European fisheries policy has been so unsuccessful in achieving sustainability that 91% of fisheries are on course to be classified as overfished by 2015."
"But the problem is how waters are being fished, not by whom."
"Indiscriminate trawling and longline fishing empty our seas of marine life."
"But throwing back into the sea dead fish that have already been caught and are good for the table is surely the opposite of sustainability."
"What is sustainable fishing, however, is recreational sea angling, which is enjoyed by around a million people in the UK and which supports business thought to be worth around EUR 2 billion in tackle trade alone across the continent."
"Some 19 000 people are employed in some 1 300 businesses in England and Wales as a result of the recreational angling industry."
"Recreational sea anglers catch and remove from the sea only what they intend to eat, leaving small young fish to develop and breed, and throwing back what they do not strictly need."
"In some cases, they tag the fish first, contributing to conservation programmes."
"If the Commission gets its way, they will be forced to land everything they catch and count their quota against the national one."
"Recreational sea angling supports ecologically sound self-sufficiency which, if practised by more people, would lessen the demand that currently fuels indiscriminate commercial fishing and puts whole species of marine life under threat."
"The common fisheries policy has always been prejudiced against the British fleet, which is currently permitted to fish only 7% of the Channel cod quota and only one fifth of the quota in our own territorial waters."
"Perhaps the Commissioner will see fit to favour the needs of harmless recreational fishermen in the UK in the same way as her predecessor showed open sensitivity to the needs of his own country's fishermen when he opposed a ban on the sale of bluefin tuna, an industry that earned EUR 100 million a year for his country, Malta."
"The CFP has already wiped out most of what ought to have been a great renewable resource."
"Recreational sea anglers account for perhaps 1% of the total catch that remains."
"The Commission hesitates to protect a nearly endangered species, but sees fit to regulate fishing as a hobby."
"It just goes to show where the Commission's interests lie."
"Mr President, for me and my constituents in Northern Ireland, the fishing industry and 27 years of the common fisheries policy is summed up in paragraph 138 of this report which reiterates that one of the few areas in which the CFP has been relatively successful is where Member States have had control."
"The ideal for us would be the scrapping of the CFP or the United Kingdom's withdrawal from it, thus allowing Member States to take back control of their waters."
"Regretfully, we are not living in this ideal world."
"The reform of the CFP will inevitably result in another second best for Northern Ireland's fishermen, a second best that has, for the past three decades, been marked by an unjustified decline of our fishing industry, and unanswered questions surrounding the state of those fish stocks on which our industry depends."
"And this was absolutely demonstrated by the debacle around the December Fishing Council and the decisions on quotas."
"Whilst it is very much a second best, I strongly support the regionalisation of the CFP as set out by the rapporteur."
"I support the view that the CFP should be based on three core principles of environmental, social and economic dimensions."
"And my most honest hope is that we can deliver a policy that will reverse the disastrous consequences of the CFP."
"However, I fear that radical change promised by some in this review will result in another lost opportunity for our fishing industry and our fish stocks."
"(ES) Mr President, everything is at stake in this reform."
"If we are not courageous now, there will not be another opportunity to create a genuine fisheries policy and we will be partly responsible for its failure."
"The CFP has, for years, suffered increasingly justified criticism and it would be disheartening if, when we are being offered one last opportunity, this Parliament were to prove incapable of proposing alternatives to what we have criticised so many times, in particular, the obvious failure of the conservation and management system, as demonstrated by both the state of resources and the decline in the sector."
"I simply cannot understand any reluctance to clearly suggest alternatives, as discussed in this House in 1996, such as transferable quota systems or effort-based management, which have had such positive results and which could help to maintain the more industrial fleets at least."
"The report says that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution, but at the same time, it closes the door on the possibility that there might be other solutions."
"I do not understand the contradiction, nor do I understand why, if someone does not want to use an instrument, the solution must be to prohibit it for everyone."
"That is not protection of the weakest; it is fear on the part of some sectors that only see permanent subsidies as solutions."
"The CFP should also guarantee competitiveness in a globalised world of fisheries products."
"The market for these products will undoubtedly continue to grow but it seems that it will grow without us."
"The policies within the Union should be coherent and we must ensure that the trade policy and rules on origin, such as those that appeared in the new economic partnership agreements, do not destroy the competitiveness of Community fisheries without being anything other than mere gestures to third countries; otherwise, it is our fisheries sector that will suffer."
"Mr President, consensus is a good thing when it results in progress, but not when we remain motionless in the face of problems, and we have many problems to solve."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a warm welcome to all the fishermen and -women in the Chamber!"
"Today's vote represents a milestone for the European Parliament."
"For the first time since the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, we have the opportunity to express our opinions on the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP)."
"In the next few years, our power and our responsibilities will increase significantly."
"This report is acceptable and I would like to thank Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves and Mrs AndrÃ©s Barea for their hard work."
"We have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report. These include specific support for small-scale fisheries."
"Those affected will now be included in the decision-making process."
"Support must be given in particular to small family businesses."
"Their presence in the coastal regions not only provides jobs, but also increases the attractiveness of many of these regions for tourists."
"Some parts of this report still need improvement and we have tabled amendments for that purpose."
"We social democrats want to make it clear that one of the central problems is the outstanding overcapacity."
"It is a fact that environmental sustainability is a fundamental prerequisite for the economic survival of fishermen."
"Therefore, the environment must take priority."
"A third important point concerns the external aspects of the CFP and the partnership agreements with third countries."
"We move that paragraph 121, which puts undue emphasis on the interests of European fisheries, should be deleted."
"We should behave outside European waters in just the same way as we do at home."
"This means promoting sustainability, human rights and democracy throughout the world and ensuring that the income from partnership agreements does not disappear into the coffers of corrupt dictatorships."
"Finally, I would like to make one more fundamental point."
"European fisheries policy is a hot potato, because it involves so many powerful national interests."
"It will come as no surprise that these have led to heated debates within the groups in recent weeks."
"Fortunately, we have all succeeded in finding effective compromises."
"However, when it comes to the legislative process, we must focus more closely on this issue than we have today and come up with some common European solutions."
"We must leave the trivial problems of national greed to the Council."
"Mr President, first of all let me welcome the Commissioner to the House in her first address to Parliament and wish her well during her term of office."
"Let me also congratulate our colleague, Mrs Neves for the preparation of this report."
"(GA) The new common fisheries policy must have clearer, better objectives that accept ecological, economic and social principles."
"A radical rethink must be carried out and, of course, all stakeholders must take part."
"We must manage fish stocks in a sustainable way."
"At the same time, however, it is important to ensure a viable and sustainable way of life for Europe's fishermen."
"I am particularly concerned about fishermen operating inshore and from small coastal islands."
"Such small-scale fisheries are of extreme importance to the peripheral areas where there is no alternative social employment and I am heartened this morning when I listen to the Commissioner make reference to such fisheries."
"The majority of boats fishing in these areas are less than 15 metres, catching fish and catching quantities that have no significant impact on the fish stocks and, of course, many of them are fishing non-quota species."
"Most importantly, there is no alternative source of employment for many of those people."
"This is why I have tabled an amendment which calls on the Commission to specifically recognise these remote communities."
"Regionalisation and the introduction of the RACs (Regional Advisory Councils) have been successful so regionalisation management structures should create many positive effects, including increased responsibility on the part of the stakeholders and the establishment of a new common fisheries policy that will be more sensitive to local concerns."
"With the operation of the Lisbon Treaty following the referendum in my own country last year, the European Parliament now has greater legislative responsibility."
"Again, the Commissioner has recognised this and I look forward to working with her."
"In conclusion, I would hope that the key provisions of this report will be included in the substantial reforms in the future."
"Mr President, our rapporteur said of the CFP that its original problems are still largely present."
"Well, I agree, and the 27 years of experience in Scotland of the CFP has been a bad experience."
"If we want to move to a system of fisheries management which works, and I think that is what we all want to do, then we must be prepared to embrace a radically different approach."
"The over-centralised, inflexible CFP has failed miserably and we must accept that."
"But we must do something about it."
"Conversely the Commission acknowledges that, up to now, local management within the 12-mile zone has generally been successful; there is a lesson there."
"I have tabled amendments for which I seek support from colleagues."
"I seek in these amendments to delegate real powers to Europe's fishing nations; to encourage cooperation between fishing nations and stakeholders on a logical basis by sea basin; to encourage the incentivisation of sustainable management measures taken at national and local level and to recognise and maintain the historic rights and benefits accrued from the principle of relative stability."
"I firmly believe that those who have most to gain from the successful conservation of fish stocks, that is, our fishing communities and fishing nations themselves, are best placed to make real decisions about management plans and to implement them for their fisheries, working together on a regional basis."
"More than just failing the fishing industry and the fish stocks, the CFP has actually contributed substantially to a downturn in public opinion about the EU as a whole, and that is also at stake."
"If we do not get this CFP reform right..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, first of all, let me congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves, for the very hard work that she has done on this report."
"We have an opportunity today to make a difference and to change the direction of a policy that everyone agrees has been a dismal failure."
"But to effect that radical change, we must not repeat past mistakes."
"No more micro-management from the centre, no more top-down regulation, no more one-size-fits-all approach to policy."
"Any reform of the CFP must include an end to the debacle of discards."
"It must involve the stakeholders in the day-to-day management of stocks."
"It must ensure fleet capacities brought into line with stock levels."
"We have to put sustainability and conservation at the heart of our agenda."
"We must end IUU fishing and ensure a decent livelihood for all of those working in the sector."
"If we can give real substance to the core values of the CFP to maintain jobs and to maintain fish stocks, we will have made real progress."
"(DA) Mr President, a reform of our fisheries policy is long overdue."
"However, I would have liked it to be more ambitious - particularly as it concerns the future existence of viable fish stocks in our seas."
"It is extremely rare for me to say that I fully agree with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but in this case, I have to admit that I do."
"In fact, their amendments are both responsible and necessary for the future of our fishing industry."
"My question to the Council and the Commission is one that our guests here today will surely not like, but it will be of crucial importance for the future."
"My question is how can we introduce an EU-wide ban on catching any fish and shellfish during their respective breeding periods?"
"Everyone knows that every time just one cod is caught that is full of roe (in other words, fish eggs), we are catching all of the future generations of cod."
"This makes safeguarding stable cod stocks almost impossible, to name just one topical example."
"I am pleased that the new Green Paper intends to focus to a much greater extent on coastal fisheries."
"This will not only benefit the environment, but will also help to safeguard local jobs."
"It is also good that the Green Paper attaches importance to sustainable aquaculture to enable us to avoid depleting the seas around the coasts of third countries."
"We should, likewise, stop fishing for exotic and endangered fish species simply because sushi has become fashionable."
"Mr President, our party believes that preservation of fish stocks should be the responsibility of each Member State, whose fishermen would have sole access to its own country's waters."
"However, we recognise that there is a Europe-wide, indeed worldwide, problem with overfishing and unsustainable fish stocks."
"There must be a revision of the present policy under which fishermen must return excess and even undersized fish to the sea, even though they are dead or dying as the result of swim bladder damage by being brought too quickly to the surface."
"New technology must come to the rescue."
"For example, one of my constituents, Jeff Stockdale from Hull, a former fishermen, has invented a revolutionary pot trap that would encourage fish to enter it in order to escape from the tidal flow, but it would allow small fish to escape and larger ones to be released before being brought to the surface, if that should be necessary to avoid exceeding one's quota."
"I commend this invention to the Commission and indeed the whole world for consideration."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike some, I believe that the European Parliament's report on the Green Paper is a significant, indeed even essential, contribution to the development of the future common fisheries policy."
"It is a comprehensive report that addresses all aspects of this policy and, in particular, the protection of resources, a global approach to the management of fish stocks and decentralised governance."
"All of that seems to me to be both very relevant and very purposeful."
"I wish to express, today in this House, France's satisfaction with regard to this contribution by Parliament, on which we have worked together, and I thank Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves for the work she has done."
"This report points out the need to increase scientific expertise in the fisheries sector so that the decisions that are taken are beyond dispute."
"Yes, we must conserve resources and promote sustainable fishing, but let us be careful not to stigmatise a profession that has long understood that its survival depends on its compliance with the rules."
"Yes, we must evolve into a market economy. However, that does not mean that we have to abandon organised means of regulation."
"I especially welcome the compromises that have been reached as a result of our debates in committee."
"Indeed, no explicit reference is made to transferable individual rights."
"This type of management is regarded by some as a management tool that fulfils the environmental, economic and social objectives of the sector."
"That is not a view I share."
"A European market that enjoys rights to unregulated production is not desirable today."
"It would give rise to uncontrollable speculation and a concentration of individual rights."
"Indeed, while it will certainly be crucial to implement new management methods for industrial fisheries - I agree with my colleague, Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, in that regard - I remain convinced that too broad an application of this system would sound the death knell for our small-scale fisheries, to which we are very committed."
"Mrs Damanaki, we are counting on you."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr MartÃ­n Fragueiro, the current common fisheries policy has failed."
"Most fish stocks are collapsing."
"Eighty-eight per cent of fish stocks are being fished beyond the maximum sustainable yield."
"Thirty per cent of fish stocks are outside safe biological limits, meaning that they have little chance of recovery."
"Cod in the North Sea, which is being fished even before its reproductive age, is a typical example."
"The reform under discussion is therefore absolutely necessary."
"Protection of fishermen depends on protection of catches."
"If we are to prevent European fisheries from collapsing, we must reduce fishing effort and the European fishing fleet."
"The ecological approach must be the driving force behind a new common fisheries policy and must be accompanied by long-term planning, participatory procedures and the application of the principle of prevention."
"This long-term approach to species conservation must also be applied in all our international fisheries agreements."
"I call on you to adopt these basic principles, so that we can develop a decentralised and participatory system, in which decisions are taken at the lowest possible level, with the participation of fishermen and respect for the needs of marine ecosystems."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is only one step on the long road to the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and our coordinator for doing such an efficient job."
"I am in favour of fundamental reform of the common fisheries policy."
"However, if we lack the courage to do this, it is important to me that we retain the principle of relative stability."
"Furthermore, I would like to mention specifically the major problem represented by the greedy cormorants and the management plan that Parliament has already called for."
"The fishing industry is of fundamental economic and cultural importance to our coastal regions."
"Therefore, achieving a balance between the economy and the environment is of great significance for me in the context of the forthcoming reform of the common fisheries policy."
"(NL) Mr President, sustainability is a key concept in the Green Paper, and rightly so: sustainable in the sense of being both future-proof for fisheries and good for the environment."
"The objectives set by the European Commission are not new but, to date, Europe has not managed to achieve them."
"This further increases the urgency of the need for reform."
"I support the drift of the Commission's solution: regionalisation."
"More scope must be given to the fisheries sector itself, whilst paying attention to environmental aspects."
"Current policy goes too far, is too detailed and is ineffective."
"In addition, compliance with the rules is poor at present."
"The good are the victims of the bad."
"I am proud of the Dutch fishermen: they and their Danish counterparts are the only ones with their catch quotas in order."
"We must encourage the European fisheries sector to become more involved and to take more responsibility, in line with the Dutch model."
"I was pleased to find this in the Green Paper; it is the only way to a sustainable future for the fisheries sector."
"(NL) The current fisheries policy is not working well enough; a dramatic change is needed to reverse the situation."
"This is the fairly strong wording with which the European Commission opens its Green Paper."
"This is remarkable."
"Not that I wish to argue with it; on the contrary."
"Some say the main reason for the failure of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is not that the policy as such is wrong but that it is so poorly implemented and enforced."
"There are important lessons to be learned in this regard."
"Policy must lend itself to implementation, and so simplification is in order."
"That is why I am pleased with the direction the Commission is indicating: regionalisation, more involvement by the sector and, in particular, compliance with the rules."
"The report on this Green Paper by my fellow Portuguese Member points out the large variations between the various fleets and fisheries; and rightly so."
"We cannot talk in generalised terms about the overcapacity or the overfishing or the lack of compliance."
"A regional, sector-specific approach calls for nuanced language in this respect."
"Last Saturday, in fact, I held intensive discussions with representatives of the sector, who told me that fishermen and scientists are cooperating more and more successfully."
"Indeed, this strikes me as an example of how things can be done."
"When fishermen are able to contribute their know-how and to help shape policy, this broadens the basis for the policy considerably, and will put us on the right track."
"Finally, I should like to offer the rapporteur sincere thanks for this excellent report."
"(EL) Mr President, I, too, should like to welcome Commissioner Damanaki and, in particular, to thank Mrs Maria do CÃ©u PatrÃ£o Neves for her exhaustive and exceptional work."
"All the important things have already been said."
"I shall turn my attention to three points: firstly, overfishing."
"Overfishing is an undisputed fact."
"In fact, as Mr Arsenis said, it is currently estimated that 88% of stocks in European seas are threatened by overfishing, meaning that they are being fished at a level which prevents their recovery."
"Chronic overfishing has resulted in smaller and smaller catches for European fisheries and lost jobs."
"Smaller and smaller fish are being caught, often before they reach reproductive age, and they are becoming more and more difficult to locate."
"Secondly, Europe catches far fewer fish today than it did 15 years ago, approximately 25% less, while fishing effort and the cost of fishing have risen."
"However, when taking measures, we must not overreact, as this may bring about adverse results, given that, according to the specialists, although we have overfishing, we are not talking about collapsing stocks."
"What we must not forget is that viability has three dimensions, which are also highlighted in the Neves report: the social dimension, the economic dimension and the ecological dimension."
"A fisheries policy which targets viable development must not revolve solely around fish; it must also focus on man."
"Fish, man, cormorants and seals are competing systems in the same ecological environment."
"Finally, I must emphasise that I, like numerous other fellow Members, are insisting on more research into fisheries."
"It is not my insistence; it is a reality which we must address within the framework of everything said by Mr Cadec."
"(FR) Presidents, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, may I thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and for the huge task accomplished in spite of what were at times conflicting interests."
"The first result of our efforts is that Parliament can now state the direction in which it intends to steer the future common fisheries policy."
"The second result is that, during the negotiations, our priority was to ensure that this text responds to the concerns expressed by fishermen."
"We have succeeded in this: the provisions relating to transferable individual quotas have been withdrawn, and support for small-scale and coastal fishing has been maintained."
"The third anticipated result is that the forthcoming document must result in a participative and bottom-up approach, that is to say, in consultation with all those involved in the sector."
"It must also incorporate those elements that are essential to the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, notably, the human and social dimension of the entire sector, which must be combined effectively with the promotion of sustainable fishing practices and with the conservation of the fish stock as part of an ecosystemic approach."
"I would like to add that, if we want to succeed in an ambitious reform of the common fisheries policy, then we must devote a budget to it that matches our stated ambitions."
"Our political commitment will be judged according to the resources that we grant it."
"We expect the Commission ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr MartÃ­n Fragueiro, Mrs Damanaki, we need clear objectives, we need to be courageous and we need to avoid another failure; participation is therefore essential."
"The fishing sector and the processing industry are those most interested in seeing sustainable fisheries, which is why they are involved in the preparation of the reform or are participating in it, for example, in the revision of a control regulation in 2009, which should have been drawn up in a more open manner."
"In order to fulfil the objectives of the reform, the answer is simple: ensure a sustainable and profitable sector and guarantee supply."
"The other key words are regionalisation, responsibility, stability and justice: regionalisation, examining the special characteristics of each zone and type of fishing, differentiating between small-scale and industrial fishing; responsibility, focusing on good practices and previous efforts to reduce fishing capacity; stability, through long-term management plans based on increasingly reliable scientific activity; and justice, revising the COM and offering inspections and controls of third countries to promote sustainable behaviour in the sector."
"Justice, too, for the women of the sea, the eternal forgotten of this sector; without their contribution, fishing would be impossible in many areas."
"(CS) I welcome the submission of the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"Just like the Czech Republic in the Council of Ministers, I support the endeavour to improve, simplify and make more effective the legislative framework regulating this area."
"The Commission's effort to adopt a multi-year approach towards the strategy for preserving fish stocks and to place greater emphasis on finding an appropriate compromise between fishing and the environment is particularly valuable."
"We must regard the Green Paper as the first step towards reform in this area."
"I would be even more pleased to see a stronger emphasis on the area of aquaculture in future proposals."
"A revitalisation of both marine and freshwater aquaculture will help to support the development of coastal and rural areas and will also bring benefits to consumers in the form of environmentally friendly food products."
"From this perspective, I support all of the proposed amendments."
"(PL) Mr President, the fishing sector is of fundamental significance as a source of livelihood in European coastal regions and as a source of food for the citizens of Europe."
"Unfortunately, the common fisheries policy, in its present form, does not meet the challenges associated with the emergence of a number of problems, such as the uncontrolled exploitation of fishing grounds or excessive fishing capacity."
"A complete transformation of maritime policy is essential."
"We are at the beginning of this process, and it should end with thorough changes to the current, ineffective European fisheries policy."
"Thank you, Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves, for your comprehensive report, which determines the essential measures on which this reform should be based. Firstly, a reduction in excess fishing capacity."
"This is a fundamental problem, which should be solved by the introduction and monitoring of appropriate market mechanisms."
"I am talking here about a system of individual transferable quotas, or ITQs."
"I think this is a kind of economic medicine for adapting the size of the fleet to available resources and ensuring profitability of the fishing sector."
"Secondly, decentralisation and a broader inclusion of interested parties and advisory bodies in the process."
"The aim of this is to increase the involvement of fishermen and to develop detailed regulations, which would increase the trust between fishermen and the bodies which govern fishing."
"The Green Paper rightly evaluates current fisheries policy, highlighting its many imperfections."
"Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves' report analyses the possibilities for solving the adverse situation of the fishing industry in Europe."
"However, the proposals do require further discussion."
"If this does not take place, our Community risks voting through another version of a reform, which will not solve the problems being faced by the European fishing industry."
"(BG) This is the first time we are discussing the common fisheries policy since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, fully aware of the great responsibilities we have as a result of Parliament's increased powers."
"There was a very heated debate on the Green Paper, and I sincerely wish to thank the rapporteurs for the work they have done."
"I want to emphasis one particular aspect of the proposed reform which is of paramount importance to the whole sector's development."
"It must take into account how the situation has changed following the enlargement of the European Union in 2004 and 2007, as well as the new Member States."
"The existing system for carrying out research and analysis and for making decisions must take into account the new waterways and their specific features."
"I would like to emphasise on this point the need to focus particular attention on the Black Sea and create dedicated bodies for managing it."
"We must take into consideration the interests of the people living in these coastal areas, the ecological issues and the fishing industry."
"I am also mentioning this in connection with the forthcoming 2014-2020 financial framework during which this reform must be funded."
"Finally, I do not think we should support the proposal to reduce fleet overcapacity, which could have adverse consequences on fisheries in the context of a severe financial and economic crisis."
"Mr President, I hope the Commissioner will take heart from the vote we had this month on bluefin tuna."
"I think it gave a good indication of the strength of feeling in the House and perhaps an indication also that you can count on many Members here to vote for quite radical reform."
"Yesterday, many Members attended a seminar I organised, a presentation by the Marine Stewardship Council."
"I have always been rather fond of this organisation."
"It was set up about 10 years ago by a partnership between business and environmentalists, which, I think, is always good."
"It had a slow start, but by the end of this year, they reckon about 10% of the world's fisheries will be MSE-certified."
"I think this gives credibility to the retailers who support the MSE."
"I think it gives confidence to consumers and I think that it not only puts more money in the pockets of fishermen who have got their fisheries sustainably certified, but it also gives them a sense of pride."
"They have a piece of paper that they can hold up to their families and their communities which demonstrates that their hard work of today is not damaging the prospects of fish stocks' survival in the future."
"This is entirely complementary to everything the Commission does and I hope that the Commissioner will support its work during her period in office. It is setting a gold standard."
"Mr President, can I thank the rapporteur for her very diligent and detailed work on this dossier."
"Since the Lisbon Treaty has been passed, this House will face two major reforms on two policies: agriculture and fishing."
"The issues are similar."
"We all want the best for the sectors and we are trying to reform them in a way which will deliver the best possible outcomes."
"I am a little concerned, and the rapporteur points to it in her explanatory statement, that in 2002, we were also full of good intentions but that reform failed the fishing sector and failed the sustainability criteria as well."
"However, I am very heartened by her very practical approach to the problems: the three principles that we need to look at - the environmental, the social and the economic - and then the practices that are needed to implement those principles."
"It is about local and regional concerns and being conscious of the people who are affected."
"I like, in particular, the idea that we could fish less and earn more."
"If we achieve that, we can perhaps do the same for agriculture."
"(PT) As various speakers have already said, the objective which we have been trying to achieve with the common fisheries policy, without success so far, is environmentally sustainable, economically viable and socially worthwhile fishing."
"The Commission's Green Paper makes a good diagnosis of the situation in the sector and poses many questions, but it falls short when it comes to offering solutions."
"The report also lays out a large number of principles and jointly agreed routes."
"These will now need to be translated into concrete measures so that this objective can be achieved as soon as possible."
"The efforts of the rapporteur need to be emphasised, namely her attempt to come up with measures, and particularly her willingness to accept compromises, which involved taking the most controversial issues out of her initial report."
"The Commission now has the enormous responsibility of presenting us with concrete steps in its legislative proposal that will allow the implementation of the principles contained in this report."
"I am certain that we will adopt the report by a large majority."
"(ES) Mr President, an important part of the future of Europe is at stake in the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"The fishing sector is a resource and a way of life in our coastal areas, and forms the basis of our canning industry and marine research."
"It is crucial for safety, quality and price in the supply of food to our consumers."
"It is also crucial for external relations and development."
"The reform must focus on responsible, sustainable and competitive fisheries."
"It must accentuate the social dimension, give priority to the ecosystem and be integrated in the marine policy."
"It is important to ensure the conservation and recovery of stocks and to revise the principle of relative stability."
"The management policy based on TACs and quotas must leave room for effort-based management."
"It is also essential to step up controls and put an end to unfair competition."
"The small-scale fishing fleet and the areas that are highly dependent on fisheries need to be treated differently and need greater socio-economic support."
"Shellfishing activities must be completely integrated into the common fisheries policy."
"I support the report and I congratulate the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs on the compromises reached."
"I call on the Commission and on the Council Presidency to give the report serious consideration in their future work."
"(DA) Mr President, I think that the European common fisheries policy is important."
"However, it is also important for the fisheries policy to be supported by the citizens of Europe and by all of the interested parties within the fisheries sector."
"There is therefore no other option than to have greater regionalisation so that the responsibility for complying with the European framework and objectives is decentralised."
"The discarding of fish must be reduced to a minimum, but for this to be possible, the policy behind the discards must be changed."
"Illegal fishing must be stopped - it is very detrimental to law-abiding fishermen."
"There must be more stringent and uniform control in the Member States."
"Coastal fisheries must be enhanced to give smaller boats a special status."
"Out and back again the same day results in fresh fish, the fish get a good price and it is easy on the environment and on fish stocks."
"I hope that these elements will have a firm place in the final reform."
"That is what is needed."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to commend the rapporteur's comments on this Green Paper, which are along the right lines."
"The new strategy must promote fishing at local level, and I should like to point out that aquaculture is a significant part of this, as it accounts for a considerable amount of resources and tens of thousands of jobs."
"Europe needs an aquaculture that is strong, sustainable and of a high quality."
"I should like, in particular, to draw your attention to shellfish breeding, which is subject to specific constraints requiring pragmatic and appropriate solutions."
"This type of breeding is often carried out by small-sized enterprises, which have been hit hard by the crisis."
"Pollution and environmental changes are resulting in an increasingly fragile and more unstable form of production."
"Producers are expecting Europe to provide them with substantial aid, that is to say, in the short term, with temporary financial assistance that will enable them to continue to earn a living from their production; in the medium term, with transitional aid to ensure that the species have the biological time they need to reproduce; and, in the long term ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur and the Azorean fishermen present here today."
"I also welcome this report as it represents an important change in relation to the current common fisheries policy and includes measures that are particularly relevant to the outermost regions, such as the distinction between small-scale and industrial fleets and the creation of bio-geographical regions."
"I also see the introduction of the amendments made by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament as positive, as they have moderated the rapporteur's initial position on the protection of individually transferable quotas, as advocated by the Azorean fishing organisations."
"Similarly, we observed the amendments made by the S&D Group, advocating the principle of relative stability."
"We believe that for the outermost regions, further efforts should be made in creating bio-geographical regions, using them as a preferred management model, in line with the existing resources."
"In addition, in order to maintain good environmental conditions in marine areas and respect the precautionary principle, it is necessary to reassess the limit of 100 nautical miles around islands, as it is vital to reclaim 200 miles so that ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, I, too, would like to begin by adding my congratulations to the rapporteur."
"The common fisheries policy is a discredited policy and this reform gives us an opportunity for a fresh start."
"It seems to me that, if the CFP is going to regain its credibility, it must first of all have at its heart sustainability; if there is no fish, there is no future for the industry."
"Secondly, stability and predictability for our fishing communities and our fishermen."
"Thirdly, tackling over-capacity; we must find a solution to over-capacity."
"Fourthly, recognising past efforts - most important."
"We also need a policy that comes up with a real solution to the problem of discards."
"Fundamentally the reform of the CFP needs to provide a future for our fishing communities and our fishermen."
"Fundamentally it seems to me that the key in terms of the CFP..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Mr President, I, too, would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the points that some of us believe should be fundamental in the final report on which we are going to vote."
"These points include: the precautionary principle, which is fundamental and essential; reducing capacity, which is absolutely urgent; limiting the public subsidy policy; and improving controls and prosecuting, relentlessly and with a clear conscience, crimes committed by those who do things the wrong way and encourage others to do the same."
"However, we also need to promote sustainable gear and sustainable fishing, which means that we have to make progress on the definition of small-scale fishing, which is something that undoubtedly needs greater clarification."
"I want to mention, too, the role of women and the recognition that their work deserves, an aspect on which we have also tabled amendments."
"Finally, I believe that it is important to stress and call for greater coherence and responsibility in the fisheries agreements with third countries; the agreements with Morocco and Guinea, for example, demand this."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to wish the Commissioner, Mrs Damanaki, every success."
"We look forward to working with her."
"I would also like to thank Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves, who has done an excellent job of conducting the negotiations."
"It is important that the countries with small fishing industries are also represented."
"As has already been mentioned, relative stability plays a decisive role for Germany."
"Of course, we are all convinced of the importance of protecting fish stocks and ensuring that they remain sustainable so that they stay at a level which will guarantee the existence of our fisheries in future."
"However, we must not only discuss the environmental and economic aspects."
"We must also consider the excessive protection given to some species, as has already been mentioned, such as cormorants and seals."
"Europe's coastline is thousands of kilometres in length and has traditional small-scale fisheries in many areas."
"Many families depend on these fisheries for their livelihoods."
"Tourism also plays an important role in this respect."
"We must take all of this into account."
"I believe that the Green Paper is a very good solution which will enable us to take things further with the Commission ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PL) The common fisheries policy has to reconcile ecological and environmental objectives with catch sizes, and also with matters of employment and the standard of living of fishing families."
"Fishing capacity should be adapted to the level of resources, levels which are established in accordance with the latest scientific and expert knowledge."
"Arriving at sustainable fishing quotas must take place in connection with the process of support for the fishing community in a variety of areas, such as investment, modernisation and social issues, including from a long-term perspective."
"The common fisheries policy should take account of the specific conditions of different regions and seas."
"Therefore, it is necessary to increase the competences of the Regional Advisory Councils, which should work closely with the fisheries administrations of Member States and the European Commission."
"Finally, it is necessary to strengthen the organisation of fishermen and to improve the chain from catch to sale, with a view to quality and high standards of fish products."
"Mr President, during my seven months as an MEP, I have never met more angry people than the fishermen and fisherwomen I have met in my constituency."
"Clearly for them, the common fisheries policy has not worked."
"Therefore, the reform is most welcome."
"I think we all agree that we need to preserve fish stocks but we also need to preserve coastal communities, and the two are not necessarily mutually exclusive."
"There has to be a voice in favour of the small fisherman and small fisherwoman."
"Also, as pointed out by Mr Brons, new technologies have to be brought on board, particularly the ones he referred to which can help with dispersals."
"That would make a huge difference."
"And finally, the whole question of research has to be looked at."
"There is a tendency, once we hear about research or scientific evidence, to take it at face value."
"As Mr Cadec said, it must be incontestable, it must be objective and it must be up to date."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves for her work."
"As regards the debates in the Council up to now, I should say that the ministers have unanimously supported the need for the reform, involving simplifying the rules, enhancing the role of the regions and decentralising decision making, except on strategic elements and principles, and they agree that it is essential to reduce discards, overcapacity and overfishing."
"The specific points on which there is agreement so far are the following: maintaining the current rules on access to the 12 nautical mile zone; long-term resource management; greater involvement of fisheries professionals; market incentives - such as labelling and certificates - to stimulate fishermen's overall revenue share; use of subsidies solely as exceptional measures to reduce overcapacity; the importance of research in the fisheries policy; integration of aquaculture; the relationship between the CFP and the integrated maritime policy; and the need to maintain and enhance the European Union's action at international level."
"To date, the debates have revealed differing positions on the following aspects: relative stability; the current system of TACs and quotas and the use of transferable quotas; limiting effort as a management tool; the methods to reduce discards, overcapacity and overfishing; global financing and its allocation; and the increase in support for small-scale fishing and coastal communities."
"As I said in my initial speech, the Council has not yet adopted a position and it does not intend to adopt any formal decisions until next year, when the Commission has formally submitted its legislative proposals."
"Finally, I, too, would like to welcome the representatives of the fisheries sector who are here with us today."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank all the Members for their contributions."
"Having so many speeches is very encouraging."
"I understood that the word mentioned most was sustainability, so sustainability is a general agreement, a framework for general agreement."
"I cannot answer all the points that were raised but I would like to underline some priorities."
"Small-scale fisheries and coastal regions are a priority."
"I would like to reassure all of you that I will take your contributions on this issue very seriously."
"I would also like to reassure you that I have no intention of introducing heavy measures and rules on hobby anglers."
"Second priority: regionalisation."
"I would very much like to discuss with you in further detail exactly what we are doing to implement this principle, because here, we have a lot to talk about."
"Transferable fishery rights: this is, I understand already, a very engaged debate with a lot of arguments."
"I do not know what will happen during the vote, but we cannot ignore this issue."
"A lot of Member States are implementing this system already."
"So what I propose is having a clear discussion, maybe within the Committee on Fisheries."
"Since this is not the end of the dialogue, we can have a clear discussion about ITQs - I see Mrs Fraga is here - we can organise a good discussion to understand the whole issue."
"Just to mention some other priorities: a clear level playing field for the Mediterranean and the other areas as regards fishermen from other countries - this is correct; we have to do it to secure fair competition for our fishermen and fisherwomen; phasing out discards; labelling."
"These are our priorities."
"I would like to end by underlining the need for a new form for fisheries agreements; a new form that will include a human rights clause."
"Thank you for your contributions."
"I think that this is not the end of the dialogue; this is the start of a very good debate between us."
"I would like to thank all those who were present here today in Parliament, and who continue to give their valued support to this process, which is dragging on, and which, as the Commissioner has just said, we must pursue if our objectives are to be met."
"In all honesty, we realise that it is impossible for a report to please everyone."
"Many will say that it did not go far enough in terms of certain aspects, while others will say that it has gone too far in other respects, or even the same ones."
"I think that right now, it is important to stress that with this report, we have succeeded in striking a good balance between the main issues, a broad consensus, and that overall, the report has the capacity and potential to make an adequate response to the needs, or should I say demands, of the sector."
"Just as we worked in the Committee on Fisheries, chaired by Mrs Fraga EstÃ©vez, I hope that we can now carry on with this work within the committee and, on a wider scale, with the Council and the European Commission, so that we can make progress towards the work for the legislative proposals, which will be just as intensive."
"I believe that if we continue to work in this way, with a sense of team spirit and the understanding that we need to consider all the issues that are important in different parts of the broad European Union, and if we try to respond effectively to all the needs of the fisheries sector across the large exclusive economic area, we will effectively be working for the sector."
"Given this, we commit ourselves to establishing the conditions whereby the fisheries sector is effectively sustainable and can develop in the long term."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"First and foremost, we congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves, on the excellent work she has done up to now and on the positive outcome of the vote."
"We hope that the Green Paper, which will arrive shortly in committee, is the prelude to the swift arrival in plenary of the White Paper."
"Europe has always taken an interest in the fisheries sector."
"We believe, however, that it is essential to provide for greater investment in scientific research, especially in the fisheries sector, including within the next framework programme."
"We also believe it is essential to improve knowledge in the sector of the rules through greater flexibility of the quota system and increased responsibility in relation to control and stocks."
"We also want stronger partnerships with third countries in order to combat illegal fishing, and a greater degree of cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean, so that we may regulate more decisively fishing in a sea such as the Mediterranean, which has always been the cradle of different civilisations and cultures."
"Lastly, we agree with the provisions of paragraph 23 on modernisation, especially of the small-scale fleet, although we would like more details on this matter."
"With regard to paragraphs 62 and 63 on professional qualifications for operators in the sector, we would like further clarification, especially as regards small-scale fishing, which would end up being penalised the most if the rules on fleet management were made tougher."
"in writing. - While recreational angling constitutes just a small catch percentage of Europe's fishing industry, it is an integral economic and social element of many parts of the EU, particularly Ireland East."
"Angling has a long and important heritage in the east of Ireland, with scenes of anglers at rivers such as the Slaney or on the shores of the east coast a popular depiction of Irish culture."
"This reputation for angling also has a vital impact on tourism in many parts of Ireland, both from within Ireland and internationally, with Tiger Woods one famous regular patron of the Liffey in County Kildare."
"As a result of falling stocks of fish, there is a move to impose controls on shore angling and to deduct these catches from the quotas of the commercial fishing industry."
"These proposals could have a serious effect on tourist earnings from angling, and also have a negative cultural impact on many parts of Ireland."
"It is therefore necessary for this House to recognise recreational angling in all its forms as an important stakeholder in the fishing industry, and for the reformed common fisheries policy to take its economic and social benefits into account in its White Paper."
"The report on the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy has the aim of initiating a public debate in EU and Member State institutions."
"The fisheries policy, just like the common agricultural policy, is a strategic agenda which directly influences all citizens of the EU, and which must be resolved in accordance with the three core principles, which are the economic profitability of fishing, the preservation and maintenance of fish stocks and the maintenance of an acceptable standard of living for persons engaged in fishing."
"Unless there is a balance between all of these principles in the draft legislation, there will be a risk of economic decline in the coastal regions, of certain fish species being fished out or of increases in illegal fishing above the limits."
"In view of the fact that 88% of the fish population is fished beyond maximum sustainable levels and that up to 80% of the total catch is discarded, there is a need to set limits that will allow fish populations to regenerate, thereby increasing fish catches dramatically in the future, while maintaining sustainability."
"The rapporteur correctly points out that, as a result of the equilibrium between producers and buyers being disrupted through the entry of an intermediary - the retail chains - fish prices are falling, which puts the situation in the fishing sector even more at risk."
"The submitted report takes account of all three previously mentioned core principles of fishing and puts forward specific solutions for sustainability, and it is therefore a good start to the preservation of fishing for all of us."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves on her work and on the report that has now been voted upon."
"The topic of fisheries is obviously a sensitive issue for the Portuguese, as we have several fishing communities, and it is an absolutely crucial issue for the Democratic and Social Centre - People's Party (CDS-PP)."
"I believe that we need a new common fisheries policy (CFP) regulation that is more efficient and better tailored to the situation in the respective territories."
"I therefore welcome the intention to focus on the principles of regionalisation and subsidiarity, thus giving greater autonomy to the Member States and allowing more flexibility for the CFP."
"At the same time, given that environmental challenges cause serious problems for fishery resources, I believe that it is crucial for the new CFP to allow ecologically sustainable and economically viable fishing."
"We are not indifferent to the problems faced by fishermen, and we recommend that the new CFP provides adequate protection for the fishing capacity of communities that are dependent on fishing."
"I also think it is vital that the new CFP ensures the quality of fish, and in sufficient quantities for people to maintain a fish-rich diet, which we now know to be well balanced and beneficial for a healthy life."
"I will be following the future reform of the CFP with interest and particular attention, and I will always defend Portuguese interests in this strategic sector."
"in writing. - On a practical level I welcome the proposed developments for the long-term protection of marine resources, for both environmental and economic purposes; the updating of fishing technologies, and the emphasis it places on the need for professional qualifications within the sector."
"In particular, I am pleased with the recommendation that any mandatory changes be introduced gradually and requiring an initial transitional period, in order to allow sufficient time for the industry, and especially individual fishermen, to cope with the extra expense in an already difficult industry."
"However, although I acknowledge that the report outlines the difference in treatment to be afforded to high-sea fisheries and smaller-scale fisheries, it is lamentable that any more expense be imposed upon the latter particularly."
"Fishing is not just an economic activity, it is both social and cultural, and the way of life of the small fisherman needs to be preserved."
"Their livelihood has, up until now, depended on the historic claim his local community held on its coast's fishing rights."
"In light of this, we should not lose sight of the promise made in the report, 'to guarantee (people living from fishing) an equitable standard of living.'"
"in writing. - It is now widely accepted that the 2002 reform of the common fisheries policy has failed miserably and the situation in the fishing industry continues to deteriorate rather than get better."
"The CFP has become a bureaucratic nightmare with over regulation and micro-management plaguing the industry while achieving little in the way of positive outcomes."
"The imminent reform of the CFP presents an opportunity to take the policy in a new direction, away from excessive bureaucracy, and deliver on all the aspects which it should - environmentally, socially and economically."
"The core goal of a reformed CFP must be to ensure that fishermen can earn a decent livelihood while also achieving environmental sustainability."
"The challenge is to formulate a common fisheries policy which maintains jobs and fish stocks at the same time."
"A reformed CFP should do away with centralised overregulation from Brussels and instead focus on ideas such as how stakeholders can deal with the day to day management of stocks locally."
"The Green Paper on the common fisheries policy tears to shreds both the European Commission and the Member States."
"It is emphatic proof that not all projects and reforms carried out within the Union are successful."
"We should, therefore, draw the right conclusions with regard to both institutional and practical solutions."
"One of the fundamental mistakes of the 2002 reform was excessive centralisation."
"The diversity and specific nature of different regions of the European Union should oblige us to regionalise."
"The European Commission must not treat the Baltic Sea on a par with the Atlantic or the Mediterranean Sea."
"Regionalisation of fisheries policy should go hand in hand with specific measures relating to social and economic matters."
"From the point of view of the people who live in areas which are dependent on fishing, the most important course of action is economic and social diversification and restructuring, including the creation of new jobs outwith the fishing sector."
"The fact that it is not possible to increase catches and employment in the Baltic fishing sector should lead to the above measures being put into effect."
"This is something which meets social expectations and needs."
"Research shows that two-thirds of European fish stocks are under threat, including very well-known species such as sole, plaice and cod."
"Analyses carried out by the WWF say openly that if specific changes are not introduced, the breeding population of Mediterranean tuna and many other species will disappear by 2012."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for decades now, the European Union's common fisheries policy has controlled fishing within the Community and in the territorial waters of third countries."
"Unfortunately, it is one of the EU's most unsuccessful policy areas, and has led to a situation that could be described as a crisis, and for good reason."
"The situation regarding fish stocks is extremely worrying: two thirds of the EU's commercially exploitable fish stocks have plummeted."
"Falling profitability and hugely depleted shoals mean that the fishing industry is in big trouble."
"Excessive fishing quotas and illegal fishing are wiping out fish stocks at an alarming rate."
"The crisis is due to the fact that, for a long time now, there has been complete indifference to the problems that have accumulated owing to overfishing and illegal fishing."
"Furthermore, destructive fishing methods are also devastating the rest of the marine environment."
"Bottom trawling is one of the most harmful methods."
"The EU must take the crisis in fish stocks seriously."
"There is also a close link here to the external perspective, because the Union imports almost a third of the fish it sells from outside."
"A crucial component of the new common fisheries policy will be to put the agreements we have with our fishing partners on a more sustainable basis."
"The key reforms must be to tackle overcapacity with respect to fishing vessels and more effective monitoring to root out illegal fishing."
"The main building blocks of the reform of the fisheries policy, as proposed by the Commission in its Green Paper, must be making the ecosystem the starting point, and the precautionary principle."
"The main focus of the policy must be the genuinely sustainable fishing of each fish species, and to accomplish this, each nation needs to have its own management and protection strategy."
"If necessary, the Union must also be prepared to adopt solutions to ensure the recovery of stocks by introducing a complete ban on fishing and the trade in fish."
"The Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is an opportunity to review this European policy in its various aspects (economic, social and environmental), redefining new approaches aimed at resolving the problems that persist in this sector."
"The reform of the CFP has particular emphasis on the outermost regions, where fisheries are extremely important to local development and people's livelihoods."
"The report on the Green Paper insists on reforms that I believe to be necessary for better implementation of this policy on a regional level, particularly decentralisation of fisheries management to take account of the specific features of each region and to link in the sustainability of the sector through the preservation of species."
"In Madeira, there is an urgent need to modernise boats and to promote measures to ensure the economic viability of fishing."
"I would reiterate that greater efficiency in the management of fishery resources and a financial support strategy for workers in this sector are essential priorities within this reform, and they must be implemented at a regional level."
"The reform of the common fisheries policy marks a new stage in the development of the sector, with more active participation by all those involved at a national, regional and industry level."
"Railway safety, including the European signalling system (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on railway safety, including the European signalling system."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the train accident in Buizingen on Monday, 15 February 2010 was a shocking tragedy."
"I understand that in the aftermath of this serious accident, several technical and political questions concerning rail safety can be asked."
"First of all, my thoughts are with the victims of this tragedy and their relatives."
"It is always difficult to find words of consolation for these sad occasions and silence is sometimes more telling."
"The causes of the accident are not yet fully known and the technical investigation has been launched in accordance with the provisions of the EU Safety Directive."
"It is the responsibility of the Belgian investigation body to carry this out."
"It should be accomplished independently of any judicial inquiry."
"The objective of the technical investigation is not to apportion blame and liability, but rather to identify causes with a view to improving railway safety and the prevention of accidents."
"The Belgian investigation body has asked the European Railway Agency to support it in its investigation."
"Two investigators from the agency joined the Belgian team in charge of the investigation just a few hours after the accident occurred."
"I would like to stress that, since the causes of the accident have not yet been clarified, it is inappropriate to draw conclusions."
"Of course, I am prepared to clarify some issues, which were raised in the aftermath of this tragedy, and I will share with you my understanding of the situation."
"As is too often the case when rail accidents happen, remarks alleging a link between European rules or regulations and the accident are made."
"I would first like to be very clear on the opening-up of the market."
"Alongside the opening-up of the rail freight sector to competition and the establishment of requirements to separate the activities of infrastructure managers and railway undertakings, a stringent regulatory framework has been introduced governing rail safety and interoperability."
"We want to ensure that the high level of rail safety is maintained, while recognising the procedures and methods specific to each Member State in this area."
"The European Railway Agency produces reports at regular intervals on the safety of the European network and monitors the development of the situation in the Member States."
"Indicators demonstrate that the opening up of the rail sector to competition has in no way had a negative impact on railway safety."
"Let me say very clearly that any proposition linking rail safety levels to the opening-up of the rail market is, in my view, just an excuse to steer the debate away from the true causes of the accident."
"The question of the coexistence of national and European train control systems can be put in these terms."
"More than 20 different national systems are used in Europe today to ensure the safe movement of trains."
"These systems developed at national level consist of a trackside component and an onboard component."
"The trackside component sends information to a computer in the train, and the computer applies the brakes when a dangerous situation is detected."
"For the systems to work, trains and lines must therefore be equipped with a compatible system."
"Levels of safety and performance of the various national automatic train protection systems are different, as are the rules concerning equipment of lines and locomotives in these national systems."
"The incompatibility of the different national systems poses a major problem for international trains because either locomotives have to be changed at each border or they have to be equipped with as many onboard systems as there are systems on the tracks that they will run on."
"There are even cases where different national systems coexist in one single country."
"The Thalys, for example, has to be equipped with seven different national systems to run in four countries."
"For this reason, a single system for use at European level has been designed and developed and is currently being installed on major international lines and trains in Europe."
"The system is known as ERTMS - European Rail Traffic Management System."
"As regards the timing, we can say that most of the national systems were developed in the early 1980s but their deployment is a long and costly process."
"In most countries, only part of the national networks and locomotives are equipped today and this partial equipment took approximately 20 years."
"The ERTMS specifications have been available since 2000."
"A number of pilot projects were carried out between 2000 and 2005."
"Since 2005, several ERTMS-equipped lines have been put into service."
"At present, 10 Member States have lines with ERTMS and there are ongoing projects in almost all Member States."
"In Belgium, for example, the line between Aachen and LiÃ¨ge is equipped, and ICT trains running on this line are equipped as well."
"ERTMS was created primarily with a view to promoting interoperability. That means the possibility for locomotives to cross borders, but it is also recognised as a system offering an advantage in terms of increased safety."
"The system is fully operational today but, due to the long time needed to install it on board trains and the long lines, existing national systems will continue to coexist with ERTMS along the lines."
"Third countries like Taiwan, to give just one example, have also chosen ERTMS, and not just for operability reasons."
"Taiwan invested in ERTMS simply because the system is the best system available on the market today."
"Several questions were asked about comparing the situation between Member States."
"It is quite difficult and not very useful to establish a ranking of the Member States and make meaningful comparisons."
"It all depends on the choice of indicators, the reference period and the quality of the data reported."
"One or two serious accidents can also have a significant impact on whatever type of ranking we may have."
"Overall data show that the Belgian performance is average."
"It is true, however, that Belgium lags behind the European average in terms of tracks equipped with an automatic train protection system, be it the national or the European one."
"Mr President, Mr Kallas, I would like to thank you for your explanations."
"Against the background of the accident in Buizingen it is, of course, important for us to show respect towards the victims and also towards the investigation."
"For this reason, we must not jump to conclusions about the accident and, more significantly, we must not begin assigning blame."
"I felt that the Commission acted correctly in strongly rejecting the accusation by the Belgian National Railways that the European Rail Traffic Management System has taken too long to develop."
"We know that safety remains a national priority and that this will continue to be the case."
"At a European level, we - and this includes both the Commission and Parliament - have always regretted the fact that the rail companies do not give higher priority to safety and to interoperability between the different systems in Europe."
"After accidents have occurred, new proposals are often made in a political context."
"I must say that in this case, everything was in place, both the legislation and the technology."
"The only thing which perhaps was lacking was the will to make the technology a high priority."
"Since the middle of the 1990s, the technology has been available to enable the safe transition between the European system and the advanced Belgian system, in other words, the so-called TBL 1+ system."
"There has been no lack of time or of technical facilities."
"The future is what is important to me and I would like to emphasise the following points."
"Firstly, we must not, under any circumstances, cut back on training in the rail industry."
"That has not been, nor will it be, one of the EU's obligations."
"The railways have highly skilled staff and this must remain the case in future."
"Secondly, we need definite, binding conversion plans from the rail companies and the countries."
"Leaving everything to goodwill is no longer sufficient."
"We need a precise timetable and we will soon have the opportunity in Parliament to find out about specific objectives."
"My third proposal is that passengers should also have the right to know whether the stretch of track and the rolling stock that they travel on meet the highest safety standards."
"This is the minimum level of information which must be made available to passengers in future."
"We also need to investigate how we can put in place a mandatory requirement to do this."
"To begin with, speaking on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I, too, wish to express my heartfelt sympathy for the victims of the Buizingen rail disaster and their families and friends."
"We do have to await the results of the investigation before drawing real, detailed conclusions, of course, but that does not change the fact that railway safety must remain a permanent area of attention at all levels, including the European level, and that we must therefore evaluate, improve, supplement and adjust safety policy on a regular basis."
"I should like to join my fellow Member and also you, Commissioner, in making quite clear our regret that a number of individuals with significant responsibilities in Belgium have sought to pass responsibility for the accident on to Europe or have at least given that impression."
"The delay in the development of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) has been cited in particular as a reason why now, in 2010, only a handful of locomotives in Belgium are equipped with the automatic stop system."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on the other hand, let us make one thing clear, and let us be frank about this: the development of this good idea - a single signalling system to replace the 20 separate systems - has taken longer than hoped or expected."
"This, of course, is attributable to the technical complexity and to the fact that agreement on a standard has to be reached among a very large number of countries, namely 27, although at the time, there were a couple fewer."
"Of course, there are also associated budgetary consequences."
"Yet, as you rightly said, this has not stopped a single Member State from developing its own system or starting to use a kind of embryonic version of ERTMS at an early stage."
"I take the view that we do need to look ahead now and ask ourselves how we can contribute to safer railways."
"I believe we can make this contribution on several fronts at European level, too. We can do so, firstly, thanks to the further development of ERTMS."
"Such a development plan exists."
"In 2009, we earmarked EUR 240 million from the budget for trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) in order to help Member States out with this."
"Secondly, however, and I think that this is an important task for the Commission and the European Railway Agency, we must also monitor whether existing European safety legislation is being implemented in practice in the field."
"I would cite the example of Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways."
"This lays down, among other things, that a safety authority is to be established in each Member State, which must be independent from the railway undertakings and the infrastructure manager, and whose tasks include monitoring, encouraging and enforcing railway safety and developing a regulatory framework."
"I have the feeling, ladies and gentlemen, that this is not working particularly well in Belgium, and I think that you should organise a kind of audit to look into whether Member States do indeed have the capacity to guarantee this safety proactively in their national rail systems."
"That is a task I should like to entrust to you."
"I, too, wish to express my sympathy for the victims on behalf of my group, and I, too, wish to await the results of the investigation, of course."
"I hope this is carried out as quickly as possible, but also as thoroughly as possible."
"In my country, a number of questions have been raised as to the nature of Europe's approach to the railways."
"I have to be honest with you: I am shocked that some people have accused us of neglecting safety."
"I was Parliament's rapporteur on the Railway Safety Directive to which Mr El Khadraoui has just referred, and I am proud of the work we did back then."
"We told ourselves that we needed to be very demanding as regards safety in all Member States and we needed to establish a European framework for this and to lay down requirements."
"We got this past the Member States with very great difficulty."
"I note - and Mr El Khadraoui rightly mentioned this - that in some countries, unfortunately, including my own, the implementation of this directive at national level is in fact poorly organised."
"I hope you take another good look at this, Commissioner."
"Perhaps this House, too, should take another look at the directive and tighten up the framework, as Mr Grosch said."
"It is not true that we are neglecting safety, therefore; the reverse is true."
"Secondly, the Regulation on passengers' rights contains a paragraph we hoped would never be needed: it concerns advance payments for people killed or injured in rail accidents."
"I welcome the announcement by the National Railway Company of Belgium (SNCB) that it will be using this system and making advance payments."
"Indeed, there was a time when this would not have been so."
"Some people have said that opening up the market has made the railways unsafe."
"I wish to contradict this in the strongest terms."
"It is not true, as a look at the latest European Railway Agency data, from 2008, will demonstrate."
"The best-performing countries in 2008 were the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, two countries that have opened up their markets."
"I also think attention should be paid to the people, to the railway workers on the ground: train drivers, station staff, administrators."
"We should be taking another look at their situation and ensuring that safety is the prime consideration in not only their training but also the organisation of their work and the whole corporate culture."
"By way of conclusion, Mr President, I should like to say that we must not lose sight of the fact that the railways are still among the safest means of transport around."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, believe that last week's tragic accident is the worst rail disaster to have hit Belgium since 2001, when I myself held the post of Minister for Mobility and Transport."
"Once again, of course, my thoughts are with our colleague, Claudia Candeago, and also with all the other victims of this tragedy, their loved ones, and all the grieving railway workers."
"I shall refrain from drawing any conclusions, just as those who have spoken before me have done."
"The investigation is under way, and we shall not speculate on its results."
"However, it is clear that, in Belgium's case, it is regrettable that the railways should have taken so long to equip themselves with an automatic train protection system, as some have already mentioned."
"When I heard, in the wake of the disaster, that, whilst budgetary reasons could not be cited, the delays in the development of European interoperability standards were being called into question as a means of explaining this accident, I found it unacceptable and I immediately felt that Europe was at the centre of groundless accusations."
"The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) does, in fact, offer companies an opportunity to invest in safety in a coordinated and interoperable manner."
"We must rid ourselves of the countless national standards that curb development and competitiveness, at a time when the European Train Control System (ETCS) is evolving."
"It is, of course, evolving, and it will continue to evolve."
"This is what it takes to preserve a very high level of technology."
"Moreover, I have no doubt that, in the next five or 10 years, there will be many more developments to come."
"It must be said that such accidents, however exceptional, remind us that there is always room for improvement where safety is concerned, and I would like to make some proposals in this regard."
"Firstly, as you know, Commissioner, we are currently discussing trans-European transport networks, their conditions and their criteria."
"I believe that, when it comes to the European networks, deployment of the ERTMS throughout Europe could actually become a priority."
"I also believe that, in this context, we should set deadlines concerning, in particular, the resources with which every single country and network will have to be equipped."
"Lastly, I believe that we must prioritise safety over liberalisation of the markets by obliging new operators running trains on various national networks to adapt a while longer to the automatic protection system that exists on these networks and thus to equip their trains with the relevant receivers and cabin equipment."
"To conclude, I believe that the European Railway Agency could, for its part, also provide invaluable support for a more effective integration of the national safety authorities."
"Such integration would make it possible, for example, for the equipment to be type-approved."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"The investigation into the causes of the rail accident in Buizingen has yet to be completed, and so I cannot comment on it, but I have come to the following conclusion."
"When there is a train crash in the United Kingdom, people are quick to attribute it to the privatisation of the railways."
"The Belgian railways (SNCB) receive relatively the highest subsidy in the whole of the European Union."
"Belgium gives 32 euro cents per passenger/kilometre to its railways."
"France comes second with 24 euro cents."
"The Netherlands gives 15 euro cents and the UK 4 euro cents."
"Despite all these subsidies, the SNCB still has debts of EUR 10 billion."
"Where does the money go?"
"When I look at the infrastructure of the SNCB, the neglect is striking."
"Everything is old and worn out."
"Could it be that the safety system is also neglected from time to time?"
"Perhaps too much money is being channelled to staff pay owing to the power of the trade unions."
"In Belgium, the railways are a socialist domain and are badly run."
"Indeed, these are questions that need to be asked, as the SNCB can hardly use lack of money as an excuse!"
"Mr President, when, in November, Mr Simpson declared in this House: 'even though the European rail system is very safe and progress has been made over the last few years thanks to the liberalisation of the market', I nearly choked."
"Nevertheless, he followed this up with: 'recent fatal accidents have raised questions with regard to safety'."
"Since the Buizingen accident, its terrible human death toll and the serious physical and psychological suffering that it has caused have served as a powerful reminder that it is high time we launched a serious debate on rail safety."
"Let us dismiss straight away the idea that all accidents are, by nature, unforeseeable."
"The main factor in the lack of safety across Europe's rail networks is a direct consequence of the separation between the management of our rail infrastructure and the management of our rolling stock."
"This separation - it must be said forcefully here - has been imposed by the Commission against the better judgment of railway workers so that the rail sector can be opened up to competition."
"It greatly increases the likelihood of accidents."
"Because of this separation, the maintenance of the European rail network is being sacrificed for the sake of the highest profits."
"You may try to buy some time by proposing the use of the best modern-day techniques as the only option for solving the problems."
"Ultimately, however, it is a different rail policy that we need in Europe."
"If, each year, there are fewer railway workers, less maintenance, less investment and less training, it is inevitable that we will have to address the issue of accidents once again and pay mournful tributes."
"In order to ensure genuine rail safety, the Union has to turn the page on competition so as to open that of cooperation."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, upon leaving this debate, none of us will be able to ignore our responsibilities any longer."
"For my part, I refuse to be a party to malicious intent."
"Without change ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) I should like to start by simply noting that the Belgian tax burden is one of the world's highest, yet in that ungovernable country, the taxpayers - particularly those in Flanders - obtain very little in return for their money."
"The rail system is a perfect illustration of this."
"It is hopelessly outdated and is characterised by frequent and long delays and by overcrowded carriages during peak hours."
"The management of the Belgian railways (SNCB) is highly politicised and inefficient, and a typical feature of Belgian politics is that, when something goes wrong, no one is ever responsible for anything at all."
"In 2001, a train crash occurred in PÃ©crot that was similar to last week's in Buizingen."
"Nine years ago, everyone thought serious action would be taken to improve the safety system; yet this did not happen."
"Pending the introduction of the European Train Control System (ETCS), Belgium developed its own system, but this came far too late and was extremely inadequate."
"The lesson we must learn from this is that more needs to be invested in safety and that the various existing systems need to be better geared to one another."
"Then, if effective interoperability proves impossible to achieve, maximum encouragement must be given to the changeover to the European ETCS, as it is not healthy for a Thalys train running between Paris and Amsterdam, for example, to have no less than seven different safety systems."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the collision between two commuter trains in Brussels, which resulted in this dreadful accident, has deeply shocked all of us."
"Our thoughts are with the families and friends of the victims."
"After disasters of this kind, people's first response is often to find someone to blame."
"However, the European Union, the Commission and the safety provisions which we introduced in Directive 2004/49 must not be made into the scapegoat in this case."
"On the other hand, the important question is, of course, whether we should tighten up the safety provisions."
"The investigations into this rail accident have not yet been completed and, therefore, we cannot yet expect any clear results."
"The major question that we must ask ourselves is whether it would have been possible to avoid this accident."
"We cannot exclude human error or technical failures and therefore both of these things play a role in rail safety."
"All rail operators, both state-owned and private, have an obligation to provide the necessary level of safety."
"The national rail companies must ensure that they are complying with the appropriate safety standards."
"I do not want to give any lectures from a German point of view in this situation."
"I simply want to say that in Germany, we have attempted to implement the directive in its entirety."
"Wherever there is the possibility of human error, technical systems must be able to intervene."
"I remember the dead man's handle which automatically applied the brakes if the handle was not pressed for a minute."
"If a train passes a red stop signal, the brakes are also automatically applied."
"We must have systems of this kind in place."
"The European Train Control System must be implemented so that we have some influence over these things from the outside."
"The members of the Committee on Transport and Tourism will work together to carry out the necessary evaluations and also to draw the necessary conclusions with regard to the safety provisions."
"(FR) Mr President, the rail disaster in Buizingen, near Brussels, has claimed 18 victims and left more than 160 injured."
"Obviously, our thoughts are first and foremost with the families."
"The causes of the accident are still unknown - an investigation is under way - and we must think about undertaking an assessment of rail safety in Europe, on a Member State-by-Member State basis."
"This assessment must focus, of course, on the safety systems, on the state of their application, on their interoperability and on their effectiveness."
"However, this assessment of the level of safety of the European rail networks must be understood in a broad sense and, in particular, must incorporate an assessment of the working conditions of railway employees, since the latter are the best guarantors of safety."
"I therefore call on the Commission to undertake an assessment of the safety of Europe's rail networks by means of a global approach that takes the launch of the rail liberalisation process as its starting point."
"One thing is clear: the time has come to carry out a taboo-free assessment of the practical results of these policies aimed at liberalising and dismantling public services."
"What added value have they brought?"
"Who has benefited from them?"
"Who has suffered because of them?"
"The aim is to compare the implementation of the European safety and signalling standards with working conditions from the moment when this liberalisation of the rail sector within each Member States came into effect."
"The Commission must therefore consider the role of public services in more general terms."
"The Parti Socialiste - the party to which I belong - has long been calling for positive action from the European Union to protect and develop public services."
"This is the idea behind the introduction of a framework directive on services of general interest."
"The latter would guarantee public services a stable legislative framework and adequate funding in compliance with the principles of universality and equality of access."
"(NL) I should like to put a question to Mr Tarabella, whom I otherwise hold in high personal regard."
"Surely he cannot disregard the fact that the Belgian railways (SNCB) receive the highest subsidy in Europe?"
"He cannot blame liberalisation, therefore, as passenger transport has not been liberalised, nor can he come up with all kinds of other excuses."
"I should also point out that he speaks on behalf of the Belgian francophone Socialist Party (PS), the party that has a good deal of control over the SNCB via the trade unions."
"If the politicised rail system ran the railways better, these things would not happen."
"(FR) Mr President, all I would say in response to Mr Eppink is that this is not an electoral platform."
"A disaster has occurred and has claimed victims - others have occurred in the past - and it is only natural that one should question its causes."
"The investigations are under way; they must be allowed to run their course."
"However, there is one factor that must never be ignored, and that is the human factor."
"In any liberalisation - I know that you support liberalisation, I support it far less, and indeed I oppose it where public services are concerned - the human factor is overlooked."
"Terrible pressure is put on members of staff, who work for hours on end or, in any case, for longer periods of time and without rest."
"As a train driver, one is responsible for passenger safety."
"Therefore, I believe it is important to ask about working conditions and any changes in those conditions."
"I believe that this is an important point."
"Mr President, the appalling train crash near Halle was a dreadful tragedy for the victims, their families, work colleagues and friends."
"The important thing now is to draw the necessary lessons from this tragedy, to avoid future casualties."
"In this, it is crucial that the voice of railway workers is clearly heard and heeded in making rail travel safe for both workers and passengers."
"It is indeed outrageous to hear a British Tory, I take it, a Member of this Parliament, malign and slander Belgian railway workers in the course of his contribution when it is quite clear that the policies of neoliberalisation and deregulation have done enormous damage to our railway system as a public facility."
"There is, in fact, enormous frustration among Belgian railway workers."
"This was clear from spontaneous strikes among those workers in the days after this tragedy, in response to it."
"This is the third serious incident in Belgium in nine months."
"After a previous tragedy in Belgium in 2001, comprehensive safety measures were promised but have not been implemented."
"The reality is that workers on the Belgian railways are under continuous pressure to work longer, with journeys being extended and fewer breaks, which means less safety."
"Of course, the perfidious policy of the EU Commission of liberalisation and privatisation will threaten safety further."
"It means that the profits of major transport companies come first."
"It is clear that the best structure to guarantee safety is to maintain the rail infrastructure in public ownership with democratic control and necessary investment."
"(DE) Mr President, I would also like to express my condolences to the families involved."
"However, it will be of little consolation to those affected - the mourning families and the seriously injured - if we continue to emphasise that the railway is the safest form of transport and that the number of accidents is very low compared with those on the roads."
"Of course, the question of the circumstances arises."
"How could a disaster of this kind occur?"
"However, as has already been said, this question must be dealt with by the technical experts and later by the courts."
"The question we have to answer is as follows: what has gone wrong in the process of creating a common European rail market?"
"And secondly, how can we prevent further accidents using all the means available to us?"
"Every accident is one too many."
"As a former railway employee, I have experienced the changes myself."
"I would like to mention some of the problems which, to a certain extent, have an impact on safety."
"At the beginning of the 1990s, instead of introducing competition on the railways, we should first have started a process of technical harmonisation."
"We should have overcome all the problems that Mr Kallas mentioned in the 1990s."
"We should only have opened up the market to competition on the basis of technical harmonisation."
"The fragmentation of the companies has resulted in many players being involved in the rail system and this is a system which only functions properly when it is operated as a single entity."
"Therefore, in my opinion, the Member States, the rail companies, the infrastructure operators and also the Commission, which, as has already been said, introduced directives and regulations without carrying out an interim evaluation, share the responsibility for the most recent accidents."
"The evaluation was only completed a short time ago."
"The rail companies have made the mistake of choosing the wrong strategy and of waiting too long for a European system."
"They have constantly attempted to reduce costs, have employed staff without the necessary level of skills, as already mentioned, and they have also invested too little."
"There are three points that I would like to highlight."
"The funding must be increased immediately in order to speed up the planned modernisation programme."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) In general, rail transport is safer, faster and causes less pollution than road transport."
"However, in 2007, roughly 2 600 people were victims of rail accidents, while last year, more rail accidents occurred involving passenger and freight trains."
"The recent rail accident in Belgium, with a casualty list of 20 dead and more than 120 injured, refocuses our attention in a shocking way on the importance of rail transport safety."
"Unfortunately, the economic and financial crisis has exacerbated the financial difficulties facing both operators and administrators involved in the rail transport infrastructure."
"It is a major concern that the lack of specialist staff and financial resources for implementing the ERTMS is one of the possible causes of the accident, while thousands of rail workers are losing their jobs."
"I call on Member States and the Commission to take the necessary measures in order to:"
"1. modernise the rail infrastructure and existing rolling stock to guarantee efficient and safe rail transport,"
"2. give priority to the investments required for rail transport safety and security, and"
"3. develop new rail transport infrastructures and implement the ERTMS."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the recent rail disasters that have rocked Europe - in Belgium today, in Italy yesterday - oblige us to consider the flaws in the system and the measures suitable for improving the services in safety terms."
"For example, it is astonishing to think that the European Union launched an appropriate system for monitoring rail traffic - the ERTMS - back in 2000, and that, in spite of this, 10 years later, the system has been adopted by only a very few Member States."
"Even today, there are more than 20 different rail safety systems on EU territory, and it is clear how this can cause problems, particularly on international stretches of line."
"It is true that adapting the rail infrastructure and the rolling stock of the European system will involve technical and economic assessments and tasks, which will inevitably have to be managed by companies in the sector."
"However, we cannot fail to observe that European legislation does not set a date by which the national lines must be adapted to the ERTMS system and that it gives the Member States the power to determine the equipment needs of their rolling stock."
"It would be better to impose and to set dates, to incentivise by means of investments or, better still, to withdraw investment from those who fail to adapt to the infrastructure projects or who purchase rolling stock that does not use these systems."
"The other argument is that interoperability and the completion of the internal market should not be slowed down."
"Today, we have an independent national safety agency, which should verify the adoption of the appropriate safety systems."
"Well, it should be stipulated that safety certificates must be obtained before operating licences can be granted."
"Furthermore, I would stress that, looking ahead to the prospect of a free common rail market, the European Railway Agency's inspection powers must be strengthened at central level."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent rail accident in Brussels, which many Members have mentioned, the spotlight has once again been on the safety of the railways."
"Directive 2004/49/EC on safety of the railways in general stipulates that railway undertakings and infrastructure managers should bear the full responsibility for the safety of the system, each for their own part."
"In the specific case of the accident that occurred in Belgium, human error seems to have been the cause."
"We shall, of course, await the investigations."
"It would appear, however, that the train was not fitted with an automatic braking system."
"Is the Commission aware of which networks and which trains within the Member States are not fitted with this safety device?"
"Moreover, does it intend to draft a legislative proposal so as to ensure that the Union's entire network is fitted with this system?"
"(PL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my sympathy to the victims' families."
"I would like to talk about something which seems to me to be very important, and which has not been said here."
"There is a debate here which, in many ways, is justified."
"I, too, have my own very clear views on the matter."
"I think a deregulated market is significantly better than a market dominated by state-owned firms, but I would like to talk about something which is important in the context of this discussion."
"This dispute is not only about whether a firm is state-owned or privately-owned; it is also about whether the market is a free market or a restricted, regulated market, which often means, in fact, that in many Member States, there is a monopoly held by a single state-owned firm."
"There are so many railway systems, and they are not only different in each Member State, but in many cases, different systems are in use in a single Member State, and the systems we are talking about are often a protectionist administrative barrier put up only to protect the monopoly firm in the national market."
"In many cases, certain equipment and locomotives are not allowed, simply to limit the possibility of a competitor from another country or a private competitor from entering the market."
"The consequence of this is the establishment of so many different systems and the emergence of safety problems."
"If you looked at the allocation of structural funds for infrastructure projects in new Member States, you would see that in those countries, there is practically no money for railway infrastructure."
"The administrators who are supposed to fill in applications and apply for money are not in the least interested in this."
"We are dealing with a model in which many Member States do not want anything to change in their railways, so that competition coming from other countries or the private market, for example, will not be in a good position."
"It is then safety and competitiveness which suffer because of this."
"(NL) The tragic accident in Buizingen obliges all of us - Europe included - to open an investigation."
"This tragedy cost the lives of 18 people, and we owe it to those victims to learn lessons from the disaster in the short term and to ensure that safety is guaranteed on Belgian and European railway lines."
"As we know, and you have already said, it is not Europe's fault that the automatic stop system has yet to be fully introduced in Belgium."
"Yet this does not mean that Europe is not now required to act; quite the reverse."
"We expressly call for the European Commission, too, to now carry out an evaluation, which must provide the answers to several very specific questions."
"For example, as you know, we have obliged railway companies - including private firms - to fully equip their trains with the new European Train Control System (ETCS) as of 2013, yet we already know that Europe's railway lines will not have been equipped with that system by then."
"I wish to cite two figures."
"At the present time, Commissioner, only 2 800 kilometres of railway in the whole of Europe has been equipped with this new European safety system."
"The Belgian rail network alone, with its 3 400 kilometres, is larger than that."
"It is clear, therefore, that we in Europe are not ready for this and that therefore our trains will be unable, or insufficiently able, to communicate with these new signalling installations."
"This necessitates a thorough evaluation."
"Commissioner, we must also dare to investigate whether the forthcoming competition between railway companies has maybe increased the pressure on staff."
"Should we perhaps consider introducing driving hours and rest periods for train drivers at European level, as we did for lorry drivers?"
"In short, this accident obliges the European Union to do some soul-searching and carry out an evaluation, and there must also be the readiness and political will to make adjustments if necessary."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, two locomotives were involved in this dreadful accident which were operated by the SNCB, the Belgian National Railways, on a state rail network."
"There is no competition on the rail passenger transport market in Belgium."
"Therefore, this has nothing to do with competition or with the opening up of the network."
"It is all about unsatisfactory safety standards."
"Mr Grosch has already pointed out that the technology for stopping a train automatically when it passes a red signal has been in existence for more than 20 years."
"The question is: why was it not installed?"
"This also has nothing to do with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS)."
"I was the rapporteur for the ERTMS."
"It represents a vision of the future, but it does not absolve the Member States from the responsibility of putting in place safety measures which are already available on a national level."
"That is a task for the individual countries."
"Therefore, the question we must ask is why Belgium did not invest in this safety system over the last 20 years."
"If they had built a motorway that was shorter by one or two kilometres, they would have had twice or three times the money needed to install these safety systems and avoid accidents like this one."
"This was not the first time that a train has passed a red signal."
"It was simply the first time that this has led to such a dreadful accident."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, of course, this discussion, now initiated by the tragic accident in Belgium, will be part of our overall discussion on railway safety and the development of transport in Europe."
"The Commission is preparing a White Paper on the future of transport which takes serious consideration of all safety and security aspects of all modes of transport, including railways - which is, as was mentioned many times, still one of the safest modes of transport."
"It is also important that we now discuss the railway package - the 'first recast' of the railway package - and we will definitely work on this and consider it."
"But I would just like to make some factual remarks."
"The European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) has been designed with the intention to have interoperability of railways."
"It is obviously a good system which has very serious safety elements."
"However, safety still remains the responsibility of Member States, whatever system is used."
"But the ERTMS is progressing very well."
"Transport TEN-T Networks: again we will discuss it soon."
"This particular project deals with the deployment of the traffic management system."
"By 2020, 20 000 kilometres of railways will use this system in Europe, including Belgium."
"This is ongoing; but in railways, things take time and investments are large and 85% of the TEN-T Network money is used especially to improve the railways, including the ERTMS."
"Of course, I would be very happy if, with the support of the European Parliament, we could increase the funding of investments to transport networks."
"That will be very important."
"But again, of course, the human factor is always relevant."
"And as we are talking about safety standards, there is one standard - which is the red light - that means that you must stop."
"That standard has existed since the 19th century."
"So if we are now saying that there will be a 100% sure braking system which avoids human error - it is not true."
"There is always some small possibility for human error."
"And human responsibility is very important."
"I would like to make one more remark about liberalisation and public services: these are two different things."
"Nobody is stopping states from offering good public services, even in the framework of liberalisation."
"It is allowed by European rules to provide support - it is allowed by states - and this liberalisation does not exclude good public services."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (DE) The tragic train accident in Belgium has attracted public attention to safety on the railways."
"The safety of the rolling stock must be improved, as well as the safety of the signalling systems."
"There are many completely outdated goods wagons, in particular, on the railways in Europe."
"The accident in Italy last year demonstrated the possible consequences of this."
"Unfortunately the EU has so far done very little to oblige freight operators to bring their rolling stock up to an acceptable safety standard."
"It is important to remember that hazardous goods are also transported by rail, which could have devastating consequences in the event of an accident."
"Against this background, I am calling for higher safety standards on the railways."
"The tragedy that plunged Belgium into its present state of mourning undoubtedly occurred for reasons to do with the specific characteristics of that country, as many of our Flemish fellow Members have emphasised today."
"It will be up to the investigation to determine the extent to which those characteristics were responsible for the tragedy."
"However, it did have one particular, fundamental cause: the liberalisation of rail transport and the separation of the management of the network from that of rail transport itself."
"Therefore, the network, its quality and its safety have been sacrificed for the sake of the profit of transport operators, which are finding the tolls imposed on them to be too high, just as the replacement and the modernisation of trains is being sacrificed."
"The timetables and frequency of services today respond to the logic of profit making, and no longer to the needs of users."
"Even though they are used regularly, some lines are being taken out of service because they are not profitable enough."
"Others are still in service when common sense suggests that they should not be."
"Delays are becoming the norm, including in the case of TGV services."
"In your liberal system, citizens who take the train have not become much-valued customers; they are still user-taxpayers who can be treated like cattle."
"As is the case with all the activities that you have liberalised, today we are paying more and more for a service that is becoming increasingly worse, not to say, unfortunately, dangerous."
"In view of the tragic accident in Brussels, we are once again faced with the issue that Member States have not yet fully harmonised their rail safety systems, even though Directive 2004/49/EC clearly establishes common standards for safety indicators and fully meets safety requirements overall, including for infrastructure and traffic management."
"The major problem is actually a strictly financial issue: the service life of the railway infrastructures and rolling stock, including the signalling systems, is extremely long."
"In these circumstances, it would be desirable for Member States to look beyond this financial issue, in spite of the crisis, and to consider accelerating the implementation of interoperable systems, as well as invest more in the railway infrastructure and signalling systems for both the infrastructure and rolling stock."
"The savings made by delaying the refurbishment and modernisation of the rolling stock and railway infrastructures can, as in this case, unfortunately result in tragic accidents where not only huge economic and financial losses were sustained, but also the loss of human lives, which is unacceptable."
"I would like to convey my every sympathy to the affected families during this difficult time and I hope that this kind of tragedy will never happen again."

"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting"
"(FR) Mr President, I shall not go back over a regrettable incident that took place yesterday in this House, an incident unworthy of this Parliament, in which Mr Van Rompuy was insulted."
"The President of the European Council is perfectly capable of defending himself, but I will not tolerate someone saying, in this House, that my country is a non-country."
"It is a founding country of the European Union and one that will very soon take up the Presidency."
"I do not understand how, in this House, one can stoop so low as to say such things, and I demand an apology, Mr President."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to speak under the same rule that the lady spoke under, in which she referred to my colleague Nigel Farage."
"It is called politics."
"You have foisted the Lisbon Treaty on our countries without consulting the people, and when my colleague says something about it and people do not like it, they complain."
"It is called politics."
"That is what we had in our country before the European Union destroyed our democracy, so get used to listening to opposition in this place."
"Mr Batten, the previous statement was a statement made in reply to something said yesterday in Parliament."
"That was the rule under which it was made."

"The reason is very simple: we must use the post-electoral context to point out that the Union's external policy is based on respect for human rights, including minority rights."
"Mr President, if my oral amendment is accepted, we do not need a split vote."
"It reads as follows:"
"'calls on the Commission to align closely the National Indicative Programme 2011-13 with the Association Agenda'."
"(DE) In the original text as it stands at the moment, it is exactly the reverse and that is incorrect."
"Mr President, this is only a factual correction."
"The new wording is correct."
"In the original text, the reference is wrong."

"(ES) Mr President, yesterday, during the debate on the motion for a resolution on which we are about to vote, we expressed our sorrow at the death of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, a 42-year-old builder and Cuban political prisoner, who died after a hunger strike and many years of arbitrary, unjust, inhumane and cruel imprisonment."
"In this House yesterday, Commissioner Georgieva strongly and forcefully condemned this event."
"I am calling on you, Mr President, on behalf of Parliament, to send your condolences to Mr Zapata's family, which is being harassed at his funeral."
"I would ask you to communicate to the Cuban authorities your strongest condemnation of this completely avoidable death, which the head of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and Reconciliation, Elizardo SÃ¡nchez, described as a murder dressed up as justice."
"I hope, Mr President, that this death will lead to reflection among those who, out of good faith or naivety, want to change the Council's common position, an honourable position that merely serves to link any improvement in relations with the island to human rights and fundamental freedoms, which, as we have seen, continue to be violated."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I propose an oral amendment for a split vote on paragraph 10, concerning the following passage: 'considers that the inclusion of this concept in the Protocol on complementary standards on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination is not appropriate'."
"A split vote must be held on this central part, because I do not understand why we are combining these things and not making it clear that we must combat discrimination against religious minorities just as vigorously as all other types of discrimination."
"It is not acceptable for the measures to combat discrimination against religious minorities to be less strict."
"Therefore, we should have the possibility of a split vote."
"(DE) Mr President, I would also like to request a split vote concerning the deletion of the words 'EU positions' from the last sentence."
"The text would then read: 'calls for the recommendations and related observations to be included in EU dialogues with both sides, as well as in multilateral fora'."
"The words 'EU positions' would be deleted."

"(HU) The aim of the regulation is a positive one: to collect information from Member States relating to energy infrastructure, organise it and make it accessible at Community level to economic actors."
"It thus - rightly - intervenes in the functioning of the market."
"Parliament has, however, accepted an initiative that is diametrically opposed to this, and even goes so far as to regard that as being the political aim of the regulation."
"I quote: Any measures proposed or taken at Union level should be neutral and should not amount to interventions in the functioning of the market."
"The majority of those sitting in this Parliament have learnt nothing from the global financial and economic crisis."
"It continues to stand up for neoliberal dogmas and even in this strategic area, it trusts in the self-regulation of the market."
"This is unacceptable, and hence I have voted against the resolution."
"(DE) Mr President, a functioning infrastructure in the European Union is a decisive factor in the reasonable growth of prosperity."
"Alongside food security and a common foreign and security policy, energy policy plays a crucial role."
"For this reason alone, it is essential for the European Parliament not only to take part in this discussion, but also to have the right of codecision."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission to bring an end to its blockade policy and to grant Parliament the right of codecision."
"(PL) Mr President, I will speak very briefly."
"The whole idea is quite right."
"I particularly like the emphasis on the ecological aspect."
"Since we are talking about this, let us be consistent."
"It was precisely matters relating to ecology and environment protection which were the significant, factual arguments on which opposition to the idea of the Northern Gas Pipeline was based."
"Those very justified, practical and scientifically substantiated arguments were thrown away because political reasons had triumphed."
"I think that when supporting this project, we should remember not to be hypocritical in politics."
"With the Northern Gas Pipeline, this was forgotten by many Member States of the European Union and by many of the political groups."
"(SK) At the beginning of 2009, it was apparent that the European Union and the Member States were incapable of helping each other in the event of supply breakdowns involving either electricity or gas."
"It was apparent that the power grids in the west and in the east are not interlinked, have different parameters and are not compatible."
"It is therefore a good thing that states and grid operators will provide essential information on their energy delivery capacities to the European Commission, which will then be able to assess the shortcomings of the networks and of EU energy security policy and will be able to inform individual countries about the reserve capacity in their energy systems."
"From this perspective, I believe we should support the initiative of the Council and the Commission on the supply and collection of information in the field of energy for the benefit of the European Union."
"Motion for a resolution"
"(LT) I would particularly like to stress my support for Ukraine for holding democratic elections and giving people the opportunity to express their free will."
"Knowing Ukraine well, I can see that not just the government, but society itself, is actively following the path to democracy and establishing democratic institutions."
"I also have the hope that these elections will bring Ukraine even closer to the European Union, and may even build a stronger bridge in EU-Russia cooperation."
"I am also delighted that perhaps even a post-Soviet country will soon enter a visa-free regime with the European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, the resolution on the situation in Ukraine is balanced and gives an objective view of reality."
"It only remains to wish Ukraine success in overcoming its economic problems and the very deep division in society over Ukraine's geopolitical future."
"I would also like to draw attention to the decision of outgoing President Yushchenko to confer the title of 'National Hero of Ukraine' on Stefan Bandera, and the decree recognising two nationalist organisations, the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, as participants in the fight for Ukraine's independence."
"Both Stefan Bandera and these two organisations were responsible for ethnic cleansing and atrocities committed against the Polish population in the 1940s in parts of what is, today, western Ukraine."
"The nationalists murdered 120 000 Poles."
"In wishing the very best for Ukraine, I do hope that the glorification of extreme, criminal nationalism will be condemned."
"(PL) Mr President, I had the pleasure of being a European Parliament observer during the first round of the presidential elections in Ukraine."
"I must say that the Ukrainian people passed the exam."
"The elections were very transparent and democratic, despite the last-minute changes which were made to the electoral regulations."
"Today, Ukraine needs political, administrative and economic stability."
"Therefore, while respecting the democratic choice of the Ukrainian people, we should support and accelerate those measures which will help Ukraine overcome existing problems."
"The European Union should give a clear signal that the door is open for Ukraine's accession to the European Union."
"If the European Union is truly interested in Ukraine, the first step towards this should be lifting the visa requirement for Ukrainians."
"I hope that adoption of today's resolution will accelerate work on bringing these ideas into being."
"This is why I voted for adoption of the resolution."
"(PL) Mr President, I had the pleasure of being an observer during the presidential elections in Ukraine, at both the first and second rounds, as, indeed, I had several years ago."
"I would like to say that we should treat Ukraine as a partner, and not interfere with the sympathies of the Ukrainian electorate."
"I consider as absolutely unnecessary the statement made in this House yesterday by one of the leaders of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, a liberal, who said that the new President will be pro-Moscow."
"The new President of Ukraine, on his first foreign visit since taking office, is coming to Brussels."
"We should assess Ukrainian politicians by what they do, and not by whatever declarations they might have made."
"Ukraine should be our political partner, and we should open the way for Ukraine to join the European Union."
"I am pleased by the statement of the new President that he will annul the decree which Mr Kalinowski spoke about, the scandalous decree which recognises as a national hero of Ukraine a man who has the blood of many thousands of Poles on his hands."
"(EL) Mr President, I voted against the motion for a resolution because I consider, first of all, that it is an attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Ukraine and that it contains contradictory references."
"It is unacceptable from that point of view."
"Secondly, because I consider that the Ukrainian people will only suffer from participation in the European Union."
"This particular motion for a resolution is paving the way for these prospects and, of course, there will also be restructurings during that process, as in so many other countries."
"Thirdly, one of the basic reasons why I voted against the motion is the reference to Bandera."
"The motion is quite right to refer to him."
"However, this House and the European Union have a huge responsibility where we have such phenomena, not only in Ukraine, but also in other countries, in the Baltic States, as you well know, and the European Union and the European Parliament have a truly huge responsibility for the fact that we have arrived at a point where war crimes are restored."
"(SK) There has been a change of political leadership in Ukraine but there has been no change for the general population of Ukraine."
"It is a population which may be impoverished, but which lives in a country that is extremely rich and has enormous potential."
"From this perspective, I believe that the European Union should continue the dialogue with Ukraine and press for a more intensive and more effective dialogue."
"Ukraine genuinely needs help from the EU, and it is, above all, the people that need it, not the politicians, but the people of Ukraine, and cooperation between Ukraine and the EU could result in a very strong partnership, as well as very strong collaboration and a very strong boost to the economy."
"I would like us to show greater initiative in this area."
"Mr President, Soviet Communism was the most murderous ideology devised by our species."
"In empirical terms, it murdered more people than any other political system, and disproportionately, those casualties were suffered by Ukraine."
"And this tragedy continues."
"The name of Ukraine, as I understand it, means 'frontier', or 'edge', and here it is as an edge between two large blocs, the division between Slavophiles and Westernisers within that country being mirrored by the rival ambitions of its neighbouring powers."
"What could we most usefully do to help that country?"
"We could offer to open our markets."
"Ukrainians are an educated and industrious people, but they enjoy relatively cheap costs and relatively competitive exports."
"If we simply admitted them fully into a European Customs Union, we would substantially improve their quality of life."
"Instead, what we are doing is urging more bureaucracy on them, building capacity, trying to draw them into the cooperative structures of the European Union."
"They are not asking for that!"
"They do not want our hand-outs."
"All they want is the opportunity to sell."
"Report: Adina-Ioana VÄlean"
"Mr President, it is human nature when something unexpected happens that we try and fit the facts into our existing Weltanschauung."
"The psychiatrists have a fancy phrase for it, an even fancier phrase than Weltanschauung: they call it 'cognitive dissonance'."
"Thus, for example, when there is a 'no' vote in a referendum, the reaction of this House is to say that the people wanted more Europe."
"They were voting 'no' because this did not go in a sufficiently federalist direction."
"And so it is with the current economic crisis."
"We are in a crisis because we have run out of money."
"We have spent everything, we have exhausted our treasuries, we have exhausted our credit, and now the House comes along and says that we need to spend more."
"We need more European infrastructure projects, we need a higher budget."
"Mr President, that is another dose of the medicine that caused the illness in the first place."
"We have seen since the 1970s where that process leads."
"It leads to a reduction of GDP, it leads to unemployment, it leads to stagnation and it leads to this part of the world falling further and further behind its rivals."
"Motion for a resolution"
"Mr President, I supported the resolution and, as one of the draftsmen of this document, I would like to make a few points on the Goldstone report, the issue which is addressed in the resolution."
"The Goldstone report has once again showed that investigations carried out by the warring parties themselves are hardly ever impartial and objective."
"The report is rather explicit that neither side has conducted adequate and effective investigations of alleged violations of the laws of war by its forces."
"Also, we should welcome the fact that the report has been revised recently and made less controversial, with less bitter language, and is therefore more acceptable."
"And the main lesson we should learn from this is that we should put effort into making the European Union more involved in the process, not only when it comes to the investigation of alleged crimes, but in a pro-active, preventive way as a party to the Middle East Quartet."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say on behalf of part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and, above all, on behalf of my colleague, Elmar Brok, that we are shocked that the House has today rejected the amendment which would have included Christians and other religious minorities in this report."
"I think it is truly outrageous that, although we are constantly making statements on human rights issues, we do not believe it is worth protecting parts of the population who are being persecuted because of their religious background."
"It is a great pity that we could not accept the amendment which concerns a subject that is of great importance for the future of the world."
"If we are not able to protect minorities for whatever reason, we no longer have the right to claim that the European Parliament is the home of human rights, of fundamental rights and of this struggle throughout the world."
"I have voted against this, because religious minorities should not be excluded."
"(FI) Mr President, as Mr Kastler said before, our group would have very much liked to vote separately on this point regarding religious minorities, but, unfortunately, the majority in Parliament did not agree."
"We have to realise that defending the rights of religious minorities is in every way just as important as defending any other minority groups."
"The EU should intervene in the work of the UN Commission on Human Rights, because at present it is totally paralysed and biased, and no longer enjoys universal confidence."
"The Goldstone report is only one example of how the UN's Human Rights Court has been hijacked to serve the interests of various antiSemitic elements."
"Currently, 21 of the 25 reports on individual countries that the Court has produced concern Israel, as if Israel were the world's most oppressive country in the area of human rights."
"The European Union needs to intervene in the work of the UN Human Rights Council."
"Mr President, since the end of the Cold War, a revolutionary new doctrine has imposed itself on the 200 states that comprise the United Nations."
"The idea has arisen that laws should not emerge from national legislatures which are in some sense connected to their populations but rather should be imposed by an international technocracy of jurists who answer only to their own consciences."
"We are reversing 300 years of democratic development."
"We are getting away from the idea that the people who pass the laws must answer in some way through the ballot box to the rest of their populations and we are reverting to the pre-modern idea that lawmakers should be accountable only to their creator or to themselves."
"Through these instruments of human rights codes, these international bureaucracies have the ability to reach behind the borders of Member States and to impose their own wishes at odds with those of the local populations."
"Let me finish with a quotation from Judge Bork in the United States, the quashed Supreme Court nominee under Reagan, who gave his name to the language when he said: 'What we have wrought is a coup d'Ã©tat: slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'Ã©tat none the less.'"
"Motion for a resolution"
"(EL) Mr President, the question of gender equality faces yet another challenge at the present stage."
"The progress achieved over recent years in the equality sector by the European Union is in danger of slowing down, or even of reversing, as a result of the current recession."
"However, effective gender equality policies can form part of the solution to the problem of how to get out of this crisis, support recovery and strengthen the economy."
"Consequently, investment in policies that promote equality between men and women must be our basic ambition and must be robustly supported by all of us, even more, even more strongly, in this difficult economic climate."
"Report: VladimÃ­r MaÅka"
"(NL) In my view, Parliament should be a little ashamed of the de facto budget amendment it has just adopted in this report."
"After all, more or less all European countries are suffering a huge financial and economic crisis and masses of people are losing their jobs, and the best we can come up with is to allocate ourselves substantially more resources, more staff and more costs at the taxpayer's expense."
"Besides, everyone knows that these additional resources and staff members are, in fact, mainly intended to ensure that the various socialists who lost their mandates in recent elections are well looked after financially."
"In the past, too, this has led to other substantial increases in subsidies, including to European political parties and European political foundations."
"It is striking that, time and again, we are finding nice-sounding arguments for delving even further into the tax coffers for this institution; an unacceptable practice in these times of crisis."
"I would like to say that the amending budget that we have just approved, to the sum of EUR 13 400 000, with effect only from 1 May, thus covering half a year, is very unwise."
"The part of it that relates to increasing human resources for Parliamentary committees and groups to the sum of EUR 4 million can be justified because the Treaty of Lisbon is making new legislative demands of Parliament."
"Increasing MEPs' funds for hiring assistants by EUR 8 million, however, means that next year, it will not be 8 million, but 16 million, and this is clearly excessive, as in the coming year, a new increase of EUR 1 500 per month is planned for Members, which amounts to not 16, but EUR 32 million."
"At a time when we are seeing massive unemployment and social crisis in all our countries, moving towards increases in resources for Members is not sustainable unless, at the same time, we have the courage to cut down on the expenses and allowances to which we are entitled as Members, and which are by no means all completely justified."
"I fail to understand how, for a day of travelling, an MEP can receive EUR 300 in allowances, plus a subsidy for the distance travelled and a subsidy for the time taken, provisions that are entirely tax-free."
"We can cut undue expenses and then debate how we can increase our means for law making."
"Not doing this at the same time simply shows a disregard for the difficulties that our constituents are experiencing."
"We have a duty to set a good example, but today we are setting a bad one."
"Mr President, I am delighted to agree with Mr Portas and the Communist Group on this issue."
"All across Europe, from Ireland to Latvia, governments are struggling to respond to the financial crisis, to the credit crunch, by reducing their costs but we in this House, uniquely in this House, are massively increasing our expenditure in both relative and absolute terms."
"We are increasing the perks and the budgets available to Members and to staff."
"The justification which is given in this report is a very interesting one because the reason that we are told we need all of this extra spending is because of the additional responsibilities created by the Lisbon Treaty."
"In a way, that is true, but I think not in the way that the authors intended it."
"What we see is that the bureaucracy is expanding to service the needs of the bureaucracy."
"The primary function of the Lisbon Treaty is to provide additional work and additional revenue for all the tens of thousands who are now directly or indirectly dependent on the European Union for their livelihoods."
"The one lot of people that we have not consulted about this are the electorates and I would love to see issues like this put before our voters to see whether they approve of our voting ourselves additional resources at such a time, when now all of them are tightening their own belts."
"Report: Maria do CÃ©u PatrÃ£o Neves"
"(LT) I greatly welcome the decision adopted on new rules in the fishing sector."
"Fish, like other animals, cannot be restricted to certain territories, so assessing whether one country cares more than another would be the subject of endless arguments."
"If we take into account new scientific research proving that today, many fish species are bordering on extinction, the need for a common decision becomes even more obvious, not just on an EU scale, but on a global scale."
"Therefore, this step by the European Union is welcomed as a good example to other third countries."
"I hope that this decision which is also responsible for joint analysis will help both companies working in the fishing sector and countries, irrespective of their size."
"I also hope that this decision will help save disappearing fish species."
"I would like to express my wholehearted support."
"Mr President, it gave me no pleasure today to vote against a report that contains many potentially positive aspects for the future of our fisheries."
"Yet the fact remains that for my fishing industry, the common fisheries policy continues to wreak havoc."
"The Hague Preference regime annually discriminates against Northern Ireland's fishermen by deducting quotas from their allocations."
"Eleven years of temporary closures in the Irish Sea have reduced our whitefish fleet from over 40 trawlers to six, and yet we still talk about over-capacity."
"Then there is the question of applying rules developed for fisheries in the North Sea to the Irish Sea: a consistent or common approach that is out of touch with reality on the ground."
"Consider only the net gauges, which were agreed for admirable reasons, but which Europe imposed upon the fishing industry with a wholesale failure to communicate the implications of the change to the new method."
"That is why, while I am encouraged by some aspects of the report, I voted against it."
"(LT) I voted in favour of the resolution on the Green Paper on the guidelines for the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I hope that with today's vote, the European Parliament contributed at least a little to the conservation of fish stocks and a healthy marine environment, and also to reform of the common fisheries policy."
"As we in the European Parliament know, 27% of fish species are on the brink of extinction and unless fishing is restricted, they will disappear."
"We also know that it would be possible to increase fish stocks by 86% if fish were not caught in such a drastic way."
"We know too that the stocks of 18% of fish species are in a poor condition and scientists recommend that we should stop fishing them immediately."
"I hope and pray that the European Union will have sufficient political will to not just draft the reform, but implement it as well."
"(FI) Mr President, I would first like to say that I voted for the Green Paper on the reform of the fisheries policy, as our group were advised to by our shadow rapporteur, Carl Haglund."
"I nevertheless wish to say that it is very important to give more attention to fishing in the European Union and the state of the waters."
"That is a huge challenge at present."
"I am particularly worried that the situation has got out of hand with overfishing in the EU - which is tantamount to theft, in fact - and that quantity is taking priority over quality."
"We should now start to think more seriously about how we could build up fish stocks sustainably and ensure that we are also able to fish in the future."
"The focus here mainly needs to be on wild salmon and stocks of wild fish."
"We need to draw up a special programme for the recovery of wild salmon."
"I come from Finnish Lapland."
"We need salmon back in our spawning rivers, and we need a programme to ensure that wild salmon stocks in particular can be retained and strengthened and that they can also be fished sustainably in the future."
"Mr President, for 11 years in this House, I have been protesting about the common fisheries policy's negative impacts on my home country: under international law, the United Kingdom had 65% of the fish stocks in North Sea waters covered by the CFP but we were allocated 25% by volume or 15% by value under the quota system."
"That argument is becoming academic because the fish have effectively disappeared."
"Even in the time that I have been in this House, there has been a calamitous decline in what ought to have been a renewable resource."
"In other countries which found a way to incentivise ownership, to give the fishermen a reason to treat the seas as a renewable harvest, they managed to sustain their fish levels: in Iceland, in Norway, in New Zealand, in the Falkland Islands."
"But in Europe, we had the tragedy of 'the commons', where we said it was a common resource to which all vessels had equal access."
"You cannot persuade a skipper to tie up his boat when he knows that the waters are being plundered by someone else."
"As I said, the argument is now effectively academic."
"It is over."
"Our boats are grounded."
"Our fishing ports are sterile."
"Our oceans are empty."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted for this report because it makes some improvements to the current system which will support better reporting of information about the investment projects involving the EU's energy infrastructure."
"The need to improve the reporting system stems from the change in the energy situation at a time when energy interdependency between states has increased and we have an internal market."
"This has therefore made it necessary for us to have instruments at EU level as well, to help us make decisions about the energy sector."
"I support the change to the legal basis proposed by the Commission so that the regulation can be based on Article 194 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The aim is to strengthen the role that EU institutions can play in energy policy, especially in the operation of the energy market and resource security, the promotion of energy efficiency and development of new forms of renewable energy, as well as in supporting the interconnection of energy networks."
"I voted in favour of the report on investment in energy infrastructure, which is aimed at ensuring energy supply and competitive potential, and strengthening the fight against climate change."
"This report compels the governments of the European Union to give information to the Commission in relation to the investment being made in energy infrastructure, in modernisation, or in efficient energy production, which will help with efficiency, cooperation and energy planning in the European Union."
"Combating climate change, ensuring energy supply and using renewable energy: these are very important issues in the European Union and greater efforts must be made to encourage and ensure effective, focussed investment, and it must be ensured that these issues remain at the heart of the European Union's energy policy."
"in writing. - I supported this report."
"The European Union has gained new powers on the basis of the Lisbon Treaty and must ensure that those powers are fully and effectively used."
"The EU competence is strengthened in the field of energy policy, and the creation of a common energy market is a priority task for the European Commission."
"However, the European energy policy cannot be effectively promoted without having adequate and clear information about existing and planned energy infrastructure and projects in the European Union."
"The new regulation is a very important piece of legislation in the EU energy policy and I very much hope that it can work in practice."
"The European energy policy cannot be effectively promoted without having adequate and clear information about existing and planned energy infrastructure in the European Union."
"As we know, under the old regulation, many Member States did not comply with the reporting obligations and this should not be the case with the new regulation."
"The European Commission, as the guardian of the EU Treaty, must ensure that all Member States comply with the provisions of the regulation and timely submit all necessary information on the expected developments in energy infrastructure."
"in writing. - (RO) A coherent EU energy policy is a complete non-starter unless the 27 Member States can provide accurate, comprehensive reporting on the energy investments which have been made separately in each of their countries."
"However, it is important for the European Union's executive to bear in mind the need to protect the confidentiality of the information supplied by national agencies, as we are dealing with sensitive information from a very important market."
"Europe's energy security is an important issue, but the Commission must be aware that the information received from each state separately cannot be disclosed, especially where it is of a purely commercial nature."
"Reporting on energy investment projects once every two years will allow the European Commission to prepare a regular analysis which will define the subsequent development of the European Union's energy system."
"This will therefore make it possible to intervene in time when any gaps or problems appear."
"A mechanism needs to be found for complying with the reporting conditions requested by the European Commission in circumstances where the provisions of the previous regulation on informing the Commission about investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community were not complied with by all Member States."
"We are today voting in favour of this regulation, bolstered by the increased authority that the Treaty of Lisbon confers on Parliament within the context of defining energy policies."
"It is definitely beneficial to pursue interinstitutional cooperation aimed at planning the EU's contribution to the design and implementation of energy infrastructure in a systematic, rational and far-sighted manner: I am thinking of the possible advantages for the programming of the TEN-E and the launch of pilot projects for CO2 storage, which represent the future of energy."
"However, the information obligations imposed by the regulation could mean that the policy interferes too much in the economy and that competition is undermined, as a result of news being spread about the projects."
"It is therefore important to ensure that the data that is gathered and managed safeguards the confidentiality and the activities of businesses."
"Analysis of this data will certainly help to ensure that best use is made of the investments."
"However, the analysis must be accompanied by concrete financial measures to support those works and to provide an incentive for private investment in the sector."
"The Marguerite Fund for infrastructure, energy and climate change must be strengthened."
"The initiative is valid and necessary, but this fund needs to be swelled with the EU resources that are already available in the budget and linked to forms of financing guaranteed by the European Investment Bank and/or other financial institutions, so that it can have an adequate share in the equity of the individual public-private partnerships that are in operation."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Union greater powers in the area of energy policy."
"It is essential that the Member States work together to guarantee an energy policy that is more efficient, safer and less expensive for their citizens."
"Bringing about the stability necessary to reduce the risk of another crisis over gas between Ukraine and Russia is crucial."
"This would ensure the security of supplies, as expected by the Member States of the EU and its consumers."
"One of the EU's biggest priorities is establishing an energy area."
"The climate and energy package aims to increase the competitiveness of EU industry in a world where there are ever more restrictions on carbon emissions."
"This regulation on investment projects related to energy infrastructure within the European Union will help to make the market more transparent and predictable, supporting our businesses and creating a positive environment for competitiveness."
"in writing. - In order for the European Commission to be able to effectively perform its tasks with regard to the European energy policy, it must necessarily be kept well informed of any developments in the relevant sector."
"This is one of the reasons for which I have decided to vote in favour of this report."
"I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community and repealing Regulation (EC) No 736/96, as this will allow the Commission to monitor this infrastructure and anticipate potential problems, especially environmental problems."
"It is therefore worth stressing the importance of assessing the environmental impact of energy infrastructure projects, so that their construction and decommissioning can be done in a sustainable way."
"Given the importance of an integrated energy policy, not only in combating climate change and reducing CO2 emissions, but also in ensuring efficiency and less energy dependence within Europe, communication and transmission of information about investments and energy infrastructure projects is crucial."
"It is vital for European energy policy that the Commission has a current view of trends in energy investments within the Member States so as to be able to develop integrated policies to promote greater energy efficiency and investment in cleaner technologies, thus ensuring progressive energy independence in the face of external suppliers and fossil fuels."
"In view of this, I support the proposal for a regulation, particularly with regard to its necessary implementation, which did not happen with the regulation that it seeks to replace."
"This proposal for a regulation contributes to establishing a European energy policy that aims at efficiency, reliability and security."
"Energy efficiency is a priority policy for the European Union given the need to preserve and maximise resources and fulfil the commitments that it has made in combating climate change."
"I would remind you that before moving on to new projects, the EU's objective of achieving the target of 20% for energy efficiency must be taken into account."
"This means that investment projects in energy infrastructures must be compatible with the aim of achieving a minimum of 20% of energy from sustainable, renewable sources by 2020."
"The energy policy that is being advocated must ensure low carbon emissions and be based on solidarity and sustainability."
"The reliability of the system is important, as operation must be continuous."
"It must take account of the deterioration of the energy sector in terms of supply, which can be seen both inside and outside the EU."
"It is also worth paying attention to crucial investment in infrastructure that manages to avoid security problems in terms of energy supply."
"The rapporteur considers that this is indeed an important piece of the puzzle in the EU energy policy, reasoning that we cannot effectively promote a European energy policy at EU level without having adequate information about our energy infrastructure."
"Yet, beyond our fundamental disagreement about European energy policy, this report can also be placed within a legal context, or within the framework of the internal market."
"However, some positive aspects are also considered here, particularly when it states that it is essential that the confidentiality of information is ensured and that any resulting proposals are neutral and do not amount to market intervention on a political level."
"Furthermore, the reporting requirements should be easy to fulfil, so as to avoid any unnecessary administrative burden on undertakings, and the administration of Member States or of the Commission."
"Hence our final decision to abstain."
"I voted in favour of the VÄlean report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Community."
"Indeed, it is crucial to have a sufficiently detailed overview in order to strike a better balance between the supply and demand of energy at European level and to decide on the shrewdest investments in terms of infrastructure."
"This will also make it possible to increase transparency on the markets (while protecting corporate data) and to prevent the phenomena of energy dependence with regard to one particular source or site of supply."
"in writing. - Despite the disappointment of Copenhagen, the EU cannot allow the lack of international consensus to slow down our own efforts in effecting a sustainable energy policy."
"The Scottish Government is continuing to pioneer in the field of renewable energy and the EU has an important role, too, in driving forward the agenda."
"The effective promotion of our energy policy requires adequate information on infrastructure and I voted accordingly today."
"in writing. - The necessity for a comprehensive collection of data on investment in energy infrastructure within the EU is clear - an outline of the major trends occurring in the industry will be needed to allow for proper forward planning and to highlight any potential difficulties."
"Energy infrastructure will be the foundation of our future economic growth."
"So where Europe can act together on this, it should be encouraged."
"The proposal shows the effects of the emergency gas supply situation that emerged in January 2009, when the Commission realised that the Union's energy infrastructure was not fit for purpose."
"The European Commission's aim, which Parliament fully supported, was to have a constantly updated picture of the energy infrastructure system."
"Today, there is great uncertainty about whether the investment projects will be carried out, and it has been made worse by the economic and financial crisis."
"I believe that intervention is necessary and that the lack of consistent data and information on investment projects should be remedied."
"Without this data, it is impossible to analyse the expected development of the Union's infrastructure and to introduce satisfactory monitoring in view of a cross-sector approach."
"Moreover, Regulation (EC) No 736/96, which the proposal in question repeals, is no longer applied consistently and is incompatible with the recent developments in the energy sector."
"With this proposal, we have therefore strengthened the existing system, significantly improving the comparability of the information while, at the same time, reducing the associated administrative burdens."
"Lastly, I should like to emphasise the fact that I voted against Amendment 81 (by which the entire nuclear energy chain was to be included in the infrastructure covered by the regulation), since there are already provisions which regulate these matters in the Euratom Treaty."
"EU energy policy is very pertinent if we are to succeed in using mostly renewable energy in the near future."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, decisions on matters relating to energy policy are made in codecision, so it is necessary to readjust the regulations based on the new legal set-up within the EU."
"For this reason, and so that all Member States are able to communicate the planned development of energy infrastructure in a satisfactory and beneficial way, a new regulation needs to be implemented to make this easier and faster."
"The whole plan may well be based on a good idea - namely the ability to react to supply bottlenecks - but the Member States already failed to comply with their reporting obligations under the old regulation."
"The proposal before us does not seem capable of effecting any great change in this respect."
"In its current form, however, neither market interventions nor excessive administrative costs for business can be ruled out."
"For these reasons, and in order not to encourage bureaucracy, I voted against the report."
"The aim of this motion for a resolution is to ensure that Member States provide accurate information on their projects in the area of energy infrastructure."
"As soon as a project in the energy sector is started or discontinued, this must be reported to the Commission, so that the Commission acquires the ability to draw up new or amended project proposals, thereby gaining significant influence over the energy diversity of individual Member States."
"This represents a further step in the direction of centralisation."
"I therefore voted against this motion for a resolution."
"The purpose of this proposal for a regulation is to ensure that accurate information is provided to the Commission on a regular basis regarding EU investment projects in energy infrastructure to enable it to fulfil its duties, especially those related to its contribution to the European energy policy."
"The repealed regulation is regarded as out of date as it does not reflect the major changes which have taken place in the energy sector since 1996 (the European Union's enlargement and the aspects linked to energy supply security, renewable energy sources, the policy on climate change and the EU's new role in the energy sector under the Treaty of Lisbon)."
"I voted for this report as European legislation needs to be updated in every area, and especially in the energy sector."
"This regulation is very important because it aims to ensure that the Commission is accurately and regularly informed of investment projects in energy infrastructure, at both national and cross-border level, so that the Union can ensure that the internal market functions correctly and that all the Member States have a secure energy supply."
"It seeks to update the 1996 Regulation with regard to the Union's commitments on security of supply, climate change and renewable energies following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This report is of special interest because it reinforces the regulation's role as an early warning system for interconnection deficiencies."
"Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has always stressed the need to achieve a 10% interconnection between Member States, as stipulated by the European Council, and any provision that highlights shortcomings in this respect is very positive."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the final resolution mainly because, during the vote, we managed to get: Codecision: this is a huge victory, since, for the first time, we now the TFEU (Lisbon Treaty) legal basis on energy to get codecision against the will of the Commission."
"Even more historic, for the first time since I worked in this House, we managed to get rid of the Euratom Treaty as a legal basis although this regulation covers also transparency for investments in the nuclear sector."
"This has been confirmed by the positive vote on AM 30 listing nuclear fuels as a primary energy source under the scope of the regulation."
"For sure, we will have to fight now to maintain this victory in the upcoming tripartite negotiations with Council and COM;"
"MS must provide, at least five years before construction starts, the amount and types of investment in energy projects."
"This is a really wise move towards better future energy scenarios, since the Commission will get a better idea of how the energy market is evolving; renewables, including decentralised ones, will have to be fully considered; every single mention of 'low carbon', the pro-nuclear Trojan horse has been deleted."
"On the negative side, we tried, without success, through our AMs in plenary, to get better transparency, including on the part of the investments that will be paid by tax payers money and public consultation, although we managed to get lighter wording on consultation and access to documents."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against Mrs VÄlean's report because it calls for liberalisation of the energy sector and a liberal European energy policy, and we all know what tragic consequences that would have for workers in the sector and for more and more of our citizens, who might even experience regular power cuts."
"This report establishes the primacy of the market and the neutrality of public interventions and prioritises 'economic operators'."
"We can be sure whose interests they serve."
"We can fear for the preservation of the existing infrastructure when an amendment calls for a guarantee that priority investments will be made in the interests of the energy market only."
"It is not enough to simply add the word 'solidarity' by way of an amendment in order to make this European energy policy acceptable when, moreover, the very same amendment prohibits the EU from intervening in the operation of the market."
"That gives a whole new meaning to the words 'fair competition'."
"Generally speaking, the aim should not be to focus on trying to meet an ever greater demand for energy."
"Rather, additional financing for new infrastructure investments should be used to improve energy efficiency."
"Despite the current economic crisis, neoliberal dogmas continue to underpin many EU policies."
"I support this resolution and endorse the observations set out in it wholeheartedly."
"I am delighted that the Presidential elections that took place reflected the considerable progress made by Ukraine and went better than previous elections, in particular, from the point of view of respect for citizens' and political rights, including freedom of assembly, association and expression."
"Compliance with international election standards demonstrates that Ukraine is taking the path to a mature democracy and closer cooperation with the EU, based on mutual respect for the fundamental values of the EU."
"We must encourage Ukraine to actively participate in the Eastern Partnership and support its efforts to ensure more democracy and respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the commitment to safeguard the market economy, sustainable development and good governance."
"I am one of the people who prepared this resolution and therefore I voted for the goals planned in it."
"Following the presidential elections, Ukraine must move closer to the European Union."
"I am delighted that Ukraine is resolutely taking the path to democracy and that it understands it has a rightful place in the community of European democratic countries."
"The door to Europe should be open for Ukraine."
"Transparent elections are an important step in strengthening the principles of the democratic state."
"Although observers announced that the Ukrainian presidential elections complied with high quality requirements and democratic principles, Ukraine's government institutions should nevertheless adopt clear election rules."
"Freedom of expression and media pluralism in Ukraine must be ensured for all citizens and election candidates."
"It is very important for Ukraine to participate in the Eastern Partnership and in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, cooperating with the European Parliament."
"Ukraine today is a European country, which has the right to take decisions on Europe."
"The European Union must cooperate intensively with Ukraine to strengthen the democratic process and integrate into the European Union."
"in writing. - (RO) The recently elected president of Ukraine is sending out an important signal by choosing Brussels as the destination for his first foreign visit."
"Ukraine is a state with European aspirations and the fact that President Yanukovich is coming to the EU's capital to meet with the leading members of the Commission highlights that Kiev is looking towards the West."
"The new Ukrainian president is faced with major challenges at a time when the International Monetary Fund has suspended the stand-by agreement signed with Kiev, due to numerous unfulfilled or breached commitments."
"It is important that President Viktor Yanukovich does not forget the promises he made on the day he assumed his mandate."
"Ukraine needs, as the new leader in Kiev pointed out, internal stability, as well as to combat corruption and consolidate the economy on healthy foundations."
"Ukraine needs to regain the confidence of the business sector and international community to be able to successfully overcome the economic recession, exacerbated by an unstable political climate."
"The conclusion of the electoral campaign and President Yanukovich's assuming office must signal an end to populist practices such as artificially increasing the population's income on an economically unsustainable basis."
"President Yanukovich's inaugural speech gives hope to the international community that things can return to normal in Ukraine."
"It remains in the period that now follows for these words to be demonstrated by actions as well."
"I abstained because I consider that relations between the European Union and other countries should be marked by equality, mutually beneficial trade and economic relations, non-interference in the internal development policies and democratic processes of each country and, of course, respect for the will of the people."
"Constructing a peaceful Europe presupposes, apart from anything else, the facility for each country to determine its international relations without imposition and pressure."
"As energy security is a crucial factor for the Member States of the European Union, the role of Ukraine is important, which is why it should be encouraged to address its energy problems by improving relations with Russia through bilateral agreements."
"That would be to the benefit of both sides and would ensure an uninterrupted flow of natural gas to Europe."
"I welcome the compromise resolution drawn up on Ukraine, dealing not only with the issue of how democratic the last election was, but also offering solutions to the problem of transit supplies of oil and natural gas, and urging Ukraine to adopt the Energy Community Treaty and energy legislation conforming to Directive 2003/55/EC."
"I agree that an active and positive approach to the EU on the part of Ukraine is not the only assessment criterion."
"Ukraine must also, as a matter of priority, have good relations with its neighbouring countries, the countries of the Eastern Partnership and EURONEST."
"I support the proposals and also the other provisions in this compromise resolution as a whole and I will vote for their adoption."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution which highlights the importance of strengthening cooperation between the EU and Ukraine."
"The political and economic stabilisation of that country and the strengthening of cooperation between Ukraine and the EU in the field of energy are prerequisites for the recognition of Ukraine's European aspirations."
"The stability of the EU also depends on the stability of its neighbours."
"I remember the sense of hope that came with the Orange Revolution, and the break with the Soviet-influenced past that it brought about for the Ukrainian people."
"I remember the promises of success, progress, democracy and cooperation that were made at that time to the Ukrainians, both within the country and from abroad."
"At the time, the European Union seemed the likely destination for a people who were clearly turning towards the West."
"Now that the euphoria is gone, today it seems clear that the protagonists of the Orange Revolution were not up to the challenge."
"The disillusionment of the people with the way in which the country is being run is also plain to see."
"The election of the candidate beaten by Mr Yushchenko in December 2004 shows either a major split within the country, or a shift in popular feeling, with people now more favourable to the Russian influence."
"I believe it is important that the European Union should maintain its ability to be seen as attractive to the Ukraine, and that it should use the various means at its disposal to do so."
"I hope that the Ukraine will persist and persevere with internal democratisation, and that, in terms of its past and its history, it will move towards convergence with the EU, a process that will end in its accession as a full member of the EU."
"Following the disintegration of the Eastern bloc and the Union of Soviet Republics, the Ukrainian people and institutions have been strongly committed to the democratisation of the country and the construction of a modern society by developing a social, economic and political system that can consolidate the rule of law and respect for human rights, despite the difficulties that are normally inherent in a state that is in the process of regenerating its structural organisation and political identity."
"As a reference area and a place for promoting peace and the economic, social and cultural development of its citizens, the European Union has a duty to take on a decisive role in the development of a democratic system within Ukraine, including strengthening the mechanisms for European integration."
"This will also help to ease regional conflicts within the country, which is of great geostrategic importance to the EU, in view of relations with Russia and Central Asia, particularly in terms of energy."
"In this process, I would also emphasise the contribution that this motion for a resolution has made to the integration into the EU of a large group of immigrant Ukrainians, along with promoting the role of young people and education in terms of social, economic and cultural progress within Ukraine."
"Based on today's vote on the resolution on the situation in Ukraine, we welcomed not only that the presidential elections were conducted in accordance with democratic principles, but also the inauguration of the new president, whom we are expecting to pursue a policy of openness and cooperation towards the EU."
"We emphasised the importance of signing additional agreements in the energy sector, thereby guaranteeing energy supply security."
"We also welcomed with this vote the need to continue discussions with a view to setting up a favourable system for granting visas."
"Ukraine has been invited by the message conveyed today to continue working with us so that it becomes definitely committed to progressing along the path to democracy."
"We have reconfirmed with this vote what we have said on other occasions as well, that we must demonstrate an open approach through dialogue and firm commitments in order to give Ukraine the necessary encouragement to favour a pro-European development."
"However, Ukraine must show that it is a trustworthy partner for us."
"in writing. - I supported Amendment 2, tabled on behalf of the ECR Group, to the joint motion for a resolution on the situation in Ukraine, which voices concern that the Nord Stream pipeline project undermines the principle of solidarity in the EU's energy security and will be constructed to circumvent Ukraine."
"Even if not directly relevant to the current situation in Ukraine, I fully share the view that the Nord Stream project has been designed by the Russian Government as primarily a political project with a goal to divide Europe and isolate not only Ukraine but also some new Member States."
"This amendment is a reminder that the debate on Nord Stream has not ended but is to be continued."
"The EU, which is heading toward a common energy market with the implementation of an energy solidarity principle, cannot rely on a long-term relationship with a politically orientated state-owned monopoly that has already failed economically and is defying the basic EU principles of open competition, transparency and separation of production, transportation and distribution."
"I voted in favour of the draft resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because I believe that the EU must help Ukraine implement democratic reforms and European values, and guarantee human rights and the rights of persons belonging to national minorities."
"The new Ukrainian president won the elections standing on a programme guaranteeing rights for minorities, and the EU must support the effective, long-term implementation of this programme."
"With this in mind, the law for implementing the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages needs to be adopted and enforced."
"Previous measures which drastically restricted the ability of schools to teach in the minorities' mother tongues must be repealed."
"The representation of minorities in local, district, regional and central institutions in Ukraine must be improved."
"Respect must be guaranteed for all minorities' rights in accordance with European standards, including Russians, Poles, Tatars, Bulgarians, Greeks, Romanians, Hungarians, Jews and Roma."
"No minority must be overlooked."
"I wish to draw attention to the need to conserve and restore the cultural and historical heritage of the Chernivtsi Region, which is part of a Jewish, Germano-Austrian, Polish, Romanian, Russian and Ukrainian cultural legacy."
"I believe that the conservation of this valuable European multicultural and multidenominational heritage, including cemeteries, monuments, buildings and churches in Northern Bukovina, must be a priority objective for cooperation between the EU and Ukraine."
"The recent elections held in Ukraine, taking into account the statements by the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission, which considered that most international standards had been met, are a signal that this country is continuing to develop positively by moving towards future integration into the EU."
"However, it is crucial that the Ukrainian politicians and authorities are committed to bringing about political and economic stabilisation soon."
"For this to be achieved, the necessary constitutional reforms must be implemented, with consolidation of the rule of law, the establishment of a social market economy and renewed efforts to combat corruption and the improvement of the climate for business and investment."
"The motion for a resolution on the state of affairs in Ukraine addresses the current state of affairs in that country and the situation around the presidential elections extremely well."
"It reminds Ukrainian politicians and government organs of the need for political and economic stabilisation, which can, in particular, be achieved by constitutional reform, a consolidation of the rule of law, the establishment of a social market economy, renewed efforts to combat corruption, and the improvement of the economic and investment climate."
"Nevertheless, in my view, the considerations with regard to its rapid inclusion in the free trade zone, in other words, the EU common internal market, go too far."
"Ukraine must steadily build up and strengthen its economy, and come to an agreement over its own needs."
"For all Ukraine's European orientation, we must not forget or disregard that country's deep-seated roots in Russia's sphere of influence, and we must take that into consideration."
"For the reasons I have set out, I abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (DE) The text contains some good statements, such as the condemnation of the Communist regime."
"On the other hand, I consider that a far-reaching easing of visa restrictions and a rapid inclusion of Ukraine in the common market is not sensible."
"It is for that reason that I abstained from voting."
"Mr President, I supported the resolution by the European Parliament concerning the situation in Ukraine."
"Among other things, I believe that we should take very seriously the decision of President-Elect Yanukovich to come to Brussels for his first foreign visit."
"This is a clear sign that Ukraine is continuing its integration with the European Union."
"I consider it important for the European Union to show support for Ukraine in the present situation, by concluding an association agreement and also guaranteeing visa freedom, provided that Ukraine fulfils its objectives."
"The doors of the European Union must stay open for Ukraine."
"I welcome the fact that the presidential elections in Ukraine were held in accordance with democratic standards."
"At the beginning of 2010, Ukrainian democracy has shown that it is alive."
"The high electoral turnout is particularly worthy of note."
"Today, the outcome of the Ukrainian election itself is not the cause of reservations which might result in it being challenged in court."
"However, the European Union must not stop at expressions of approval for the way the elections were conducted."
"It is essential to offer Ukraine a European perspective in several steps."
"The first step should be participation in the Eastern Partnership, and the last should be membership of the European Union."
"The European Union must maintain an open-door policy towards Ukraine."
"The degree of integration with different communities is a matter for Ukraine to decide - this should depend on a sovereign decision of Ukrainian society."
"An improvement in relations between Ukraine and Russia is in the vital interest of the European Union."
"For the consequences of bilateral relations between Ukraine and Russia also concern EU Member States."
"I welcome the announcement of an improvement in these relations."
"The presidential elections in Ukraine complied with international election standards."
"The country has taken a step towards European democracy."
"This is proof that Ukraine increasingly feels itself to be part of the community of European democratic states."
"Let us hope that the new Ukrainian President will be a reliable partner with whom we can cooperate to strengthen stability and economic development in Eastern Europe together with other neighbouring states."
"One of the most important practical steps in EU relations with Ukraine is the simplification of the visa regime, the end goal of which is the abolition of visas for citizens of Ukraine travelling to the EU."
"I voted for this resolution because it takes into account the positive changes in such an important neighbouring state of the EU, although there still remain many complications and tensions between various government institutions in this country."
"During this plenary session we voted on the European Parliament resolution on the situation in Ukraine."
"I endorsed the resolution, because it is a very important declaration of our institution which testifies to the fact that we are carefully following the development of democracy in Ukraine."
"The resolution gives a generally good assessment of the course of the presidential elections, and calls for efforts to ensure the political and economic stability of the country."
"A key point is that it is essential to strengthen cooperation between Ukraine and the EU, especially in the area of energy."
"From my point of view, there were two controversial amendments."
"The first concerned minority languages."
"I voted against this amendment, because it increased the possibility of using Russian instead of Ukrainian."
"The second amendment was the one about the Nord Stream pipeline."
"In this case, I voted in favour of the amendment, because I wanted to manifest my opposition to construction of this pipeline."
"The European Union campaigned for the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to be set up and has undertaken, along with Member States, to play an active, high-profile role to support an effective body which deals with the current challenges facing human rights."
"The new institutional structure created following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon offers the opportunity to improve the coherence, profile and credibility of the EU's actions as part of the UNHRC."
"This is why it is important for the EU to adopt a common, consolidated position during the 13th session of the UNHRC with regard to all the matters which will be discussed."
"The EU must have an effective influence as part of the UN's extended system and remain committed to finding a common position, as well as increase flexibility on less important issues to enable it to respond more quickly and effectively in negotiations on fundamental issues."
"Above all, it must be actively committed to creating dedicated UNHRC mechanisms for responding quickly and effectively to human rights crises in Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen."
"in writing. - Human rights are still violated in many countries and it is unfortunate that grave violations sometimes are not addressed timely and properly by the international community."
"We are lacking a coordinated approach on the international stage."
"The EU's role as a global player has increased in recent decades and the newly established European External Action Service under the Lisbon Treaty could be instrumental in helping the Union to act more effectively to meet global challenges and to address human rights violations in a more coherent, consistent and efficient manner."
"The EU now has a great opportunity to strengthen its role in the UN Human Rights Council and should fully use it to increase visibility and credibility of EU actions in the area of human rights."
"The compromise resolution put to the vote in this House unfortunately contains passages that prevent me from voting in favour."
"The UNHCR is a political body that is subject to 'extreme politicisation', as is acknowledged in the text of the resolution."
"However, we could have - I believe - said much more, especially since we are dealing with a subject that is sensitive and important to so many of us, namely human rights."
"Upon reading the text, I note an unfortunate weakness - perhaps not for the politics of diplomacy, but certainly for that of values - and that is the lack of determination when criticising the well-known aspects that make the UNHCR a very controversial body."
"We could have, in fact, been more decisive, speaking out more strongly against Iran's candidacy in the next Council elections."
"There is no specific reference to the senseless composition of a Council in which there sit too many members who are scarcely qualified to lecture on human rights, and who evidently have even fewer credentials to be able to judge or to try anyone."
"My vote is therefore one of abstention and of scepticism about this text: I am abstaining in the hope that Parliament will take off its diplomatic hat - it is not its job to be diplomatic - and embrace more courageously the battle for values and for human rights."
"I abstained, despite the fact that the motion for a resolution contains positive elements, because important amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were voted down and, as a result, the content was inadequate."
"The European Union must support efforts by the UN to ensure that human rights are respected throughout the world."
"It must take centre stage in this sort of initiative, all the more so nowadays, when infringements tend to be the rule under autocratic regimes which engage in 'capitalist violence' in order to impose their antisocial policies."
"The European Union must re-examine its relations with the state of Israel, taking serious account of Israel's military operations on Palestinian territory and of attacks on the rights of the Palestinian people, including the right to eventually acquire its own homeland."
"The European Union must resign from US 'democracy export' campaigns and create a framework for international relations with respect for the rules of international law and an enhanced role for the UN."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today, 25 February 2010, voted in favour of the joint resolution on the 13th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council,."
"We would, however, like to point out that we believe that EU Member States should be urged to denounce violations of human rights in general and that it is regrettable that the United Nations Human Rights Council has not managed to deal sufficiently quickly with serious human rights situations in other countries not mentioned in the resolution either, for example Cuba, as well as other countries."
"I must emphasise that compliance with international human rights legislation and humanitarian legislation by all parties, in every circumstance, remains a vital condition for establishing a just and lasting peace throughout the world."
"I believe that at European Union level, concerted action by both the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Member States, which are calling for a strong common position, would guarantee that those who are guilty of violations of international human rights legislation and international humanitarian legislation are held to account."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on the United Nations Platform for Action for Gender Equality, which identifies key steps required for the European Union to meet strategic objectives on equality between women and men."
"There is a clear need for the Commission to step up efforts to compile comparable data on critical indicators for the follow-up to the Platform for Action, and to translate it into regular reviews of gender mainstreaming initiatives across a range of policy fields."
"It is especially important to monitor, and act on, the gender dimension of poverty, violence and the needs of girl-children."
"The follow-up to the Commission's Roadmap for Equality between Women and Men 2006-2010 must take into consideration the long-term consequences of the economic crisis and climate change in a society that is getting older and ethnically more diverse."
"Sexual and reproductive health and rights need to be acknowledged and furthered in Europe and at a global level."
"The European Union should now become party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, a legal step made possible by the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the 13th session of the UN Human Rights Council."
"The new institutional structure of the EU offers a unique opportunity to increase the coherence, visibility and credibility of the EU within the UN Human Rights Council."
"The activities of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy will also help to enhance the EU's ability to cooperate with countries from other regional blocs, with a view to stopping human rights violations, including violence directed specifically against women and children."
"The politicisation of the Human Rights Council and the ongoing blockade against those who have taken a stronger stance in condemning human rights violations in various parts of the world justify a change in the Council's structure and way of operating."
"The candidacy of Iran that has been announced is yet another sign that the path taken by this body may be lacking credibility and security, and that countries with a history of repeated human rights violations can use membership of the Council to try to whitewash their own violations."
"The European Union must actively participate in the work of the Council, while remaining aware of its limitations and problems, and try to impart a balanced, yet strict and exacting, view of what respect for human rights should be."
"If it does this, it will be capable of meeting its own responsibilities in this matter."
"The Human Rights Council (UNHRC) is a platform specialising in universal human rights and a specific forum dealing with human rights within the UN system."
"The promotion and safeguarding the universality of human rights is part of the EU's legal, ethical and cultural acquis and one of the cornerstones of its unity and integrity."
"I am sure that the Member States of the EU are opposed to any attempt to undermine the concepts of universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights."
"I expect that there will be active participation from the Member States in the annual interactive debate on the rights of persons with disabilities and the annual meeting on the rights of the child ..."
"I would like to stress the importance of the 13th session of the UNHRC, which will be attended by ministers and other high-level representatives."
"Its agenda includes the economic and financial crisis and the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training."
"Finally, I welcome the re-engagement of the United States in UN bodies and its subsequent election as a member of the UNHRC, as well as its constructive work on freedom of expression in the 64th UN General Assembly."
"We very much agree with the concept mentioned in the report, regarding the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of human rights."
"However, based on these same assumptions, it is necessary to stress the irreconcilable contradiction between this view and the severe attack on the rights of workers and of the people, caused by the crisis of the capitalist system, including high unemployment rates, increased poverty and increasingly difficult access to good quality public services at affordable prices."
"Unfortunately, the majority in Parliament did not take proper account of this contradiction."
"We regret the rejection of the proposals made by our group, particularly the following:"
"points out that the Member States of the UN should promote food sovereignty and food security as an instrument for reducing poverty and unemployment;"
"welcomes the fact that a report from the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the violations of human rights in Honduras since the coup d'Ã©tat is on the agenda of the 13th session; calls on the EU Member States to work for and support a strong condemnation of the coup d'Ã©tat and for the restoration of democracy and the rule of law in that country;"
"expresses its concern at the situation in Colombia, particularly the discovery of thousands of unidentified dead."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on the 13th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, firstly to very warmly welcome the initiative to have the UNHCR put at the top of its agenda the impact of the global economic and financial crises to the realisation of all human rights."
"I also think it is important to highlight the need for a strong EU common position on the follow-up to the fact-finding mission on the conflict in Gaza and Southern Israel; it is imperative, in this regard, that the recommendations included in the Goldstone report be implemented."
"Finally, Iran's candidacy in the UNHRC elections to be held in May 2010 is of particular concern and must be followed up with strong EU action to prevent countries with a dubious human rights record from being elected."
"As the Human Rights Council is an intergovernmental body whose main purpose is to address human rights violations, and given that one of the cornerstones of European unity and integrity is respect for and safeguarding of the universality of human rights, I would like to express my encouragement for the UNHRC, hoping that it continues to combat all forms of discrimination."
"Our resolution is addressed to the UN Human Rights Council, an institution that one would have hoped to promote to the rank of the world's enforcer of respect for rights, values and the most fundamental freedoms."
"I use the conditional tense because the UNHCR's legitimacy is more than undermined by its lack of impartiality."
"Now all of a sudden, we have the added issue of Iran's candidacy."
"This is a provocation."
"This state, this government, this president, scorn the rights of men and women."
"At least 346 of the country's citizens, including minors, were either hanged or stoned to death in 2008."
"The trials there are farcical."
"Torture is used."
"There is a complete absence of freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of the press."
"Minorities, particular the Baha'is, are persecuted."
"Since the presidential elections of June 2009, any form of demonstration has been bloodily and systematically repressed."
"I could go on."
"The world needs governance that is based on universal values."
"If the UN wishes to be the forum for this dialogue, it must ensure that its bodies are objective."
"Iran's candidacy is much more than a test of the UN's credibility; it is a test of its viability."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the final text of the resolution, among other reasons, because it kept the paragraphs related to the joint study related to the existence of secret detention centres, the necessary implementation of the recommendations of the Goldstone report and the ICC, and because it included also the amendment on Western Sahara tabled by GUE."
"I am also glad that the request made by Brok to have a separate vote on the paragraph dealing with the defamation of religion was rejected and that the paragraph stated as follows:"
"10. Reiterates its position with regard to the concept of 'defamation of religions' and while recognising the need to fully address the problem of discrimination of religious minorities, considers that the inclusion of this concept in the Protocol on complementary standards on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and all forms of discrimination is not appropriate; calls on UN Member States to fully implement the existing standards on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion and belief;"
"We wanted to keep this sentence because we are of the opinion that we do not need a new legislation at the UN level which should deal with the concept of defamation of religions as we already have international standards, notably the protocol mentioned preventing discrimination of religious minorities."
"EU policy on respect for human rights is one of the most important values which we are putting into practice."
"Community policy on respect for human rights includes protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights."
"It attaches significant importance to support for the rights of women, children and national minorities and, in particular, to combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination."
"It is very dangerous when legislation which discriminates against minorities is used to violate their right to freedom of religion or when it restricts their access to education and employment, thus restricting their right to work, which, in turn, restricts their right to have an adequate standard of living."
"The Union's work in this area to date gives us the right to demand respect from others for high standards in the field of democracy and human rights."
"On the subject of human rights, at all levels and in all areas of the EU, it must be stressed that our duty as MEPs is not just to criticise and prepare resolutions on third countries, but to also closely observe EU Member States, paying attention to even the slightest negative phenomena which violate human rights."
"In cases where human rights are violated, the European Parliament prepares a resolution which is addressed to the appropriate country."
"Before we criticise others, we must first stop human rights violations within the EU, and then we will be able to criticise others and try to help them as much as possible."
"I did not support this resolution because it fails to highlight the importance of the human rights of Christian minorities in the Middle East."
"I regret the lack of courage shown when it comes to condemning the attacks on Christian minorities in the Middle East and to referring this problem to the Human Rights Council."
"The General Assembly of the United Nations declared 2009 as the 'International Year of Human Rights Learning', and the EU has declared 2010 as the 'European Year for Combating Poverty'."
"We should remember that the UN has recognised extreme poverty as being a violation of human rights."
"In the marble of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe buildings, we have engraved the leitmotif of 17 October - the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty: 'Wherever men and women are condemned to live in poverty, human rights are violated."
"To come together to ensure that these rights be respected is our solemn duty."
"Father Joseph Wresinski'."
"Our resolution fails to express our deep concern about extreme poverty as a violation of human rights."
"That is why I am inviting the members of the European Fourth World Committee to send a letter along these lines to the delegates of the UN General Assembly expressing Parliament's concern in this area."
"Equality between women and men is a fundamental right and common value of the European Union."
"It is also a prerequisite for achieving the EU's objectives of economic growth, employment and social cohesion."
"Although significant progress has been made in terms of achieving the objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action, adopted in 1995, gender inequality and stereotypes persist."
"I believe that the review of the Lisbon Strategy must focus more on gender equality, set new objectives and strengthen the ties with the Beijing Platform for Action so that Member States achieve concrete results through specific policies."
"This is why better promotion is required of the exchange of experience and good practice between Member States in all areas affected by the Beijing Platform for Action."
"I voted in favour of the resolution for the Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality."
"Fifteen years after the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the European Parliament is debating today the progress made globally in terms of gender equality."
"Equal opportunities for men and women is one of the European Union's fundamental values."
"Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union highlights a number of values shared by Member States: pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and gender equality."
"Even though considerable progress has been made in certain areas and industrial sectors, there are still inequalities which persist."
"In this respect, the European Union must continue to make efforts to resolve these issues."
"Equality must be promoted in every area."
"At European level, when devising strategies for combating the economic crisis and the impact of climate change, the European Commission must also take into account the effect these strategies have on women."
"The resolution encourages the development of the strategies and instruments required to establish the situation on gender equality devised by the European Institute for Gender Equality."
"I voted in favour of the resolution on Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality, as the strategic objectives of the Beijing Platform have not been achieved and inequality and gender stereotypes persist, with women remaining in a position subordinate to men in the areas addressed in the Platform."
"We regret the lack of timely, reliable, comparable data, at both regional and EU level, for the indicators decided on for the follow-up to the Beijing Platform for Action, including women and poverty, violence against women, institutional mechanisms, women and armed conflict and the girl child."
"The Commission must develop further the annual review of the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action and use the indicators and analytical reports effectively as a contribution to different policy fields, as well as a basis for new initiatives aimed at achieving gender equality."
"We would like to reiterate the need for systematic implementation and monitoring of gender mainstreaming in legislative, budgetary and other important processes, and of strategies, programmes and projects in different policy fields."
"I voted for this resolution, as we must develop further the perspective of gender equality throughout the European Union."
"The European Commission should prepare a strategy of action for gender equality guidelines and take into account the economic and financial crisis, sustainable development, as well as current guideline priorities, equal economic independence for women and men, combining work, family and private life and equal participation of women and men in decision making."
"At present, there is a distinct lack of data on gender equality, violence against women and institutional mechanisms."
"It is very important that the Member States cooperate as closely as possible with the European Institute for Gender Equality, one of whose tasks is work with comparable data."
"The institute will keep statistics, research will be carried out, the goal of which will be to provide analyses of gender equality matters and studies will be carried out into data indicator statistics and data explanation."
"The aims laid down in the institute's work programme should particularly help implement the indicators set out in Beijing."
"Gender equality is a fundamental principle in our times, but gender inequality persists, and the strategic objectives of the Beijing Platform are still a long way from being achieved."
"I welcome the motion for a resolution to be voted upon today in plenary, as it is an incentive for improving institutional mechanisms for promoting gender equality."
"Gender mainstreaming in development cooperation is essential for promoting a more prosperous, fairer and richer society."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of the role that women play in science and technology."
"Women are increasingly present in areas of scientific research, but they remain a long way from the top of their careers and the centres of decision making."
"Taking advantage of this potential is essential for promoting a fair balance and for supporting growth and employment."
"It is crucial to consider gender mainstreaming in different policy fields as one of the pillars of a more prosperous, fairer and richer society."
"As a staunch defender of human rights and the principle of equality, I would not undermine initiatives that aim to protect the rights of women and girls."
"Such rights are often severely violated in a world where women are still the main victims of crimes against their physical wellbeing and sexual self-determination."
"However, gender equality can never for an instant mask the natural, social and cultural difference between the sexes; equal rights are not the same thing as equal treatment."
"Men and women need to be treated fairly, giving them the same rights but taking their respective needs into account."
"In the case of women, this is particularly pertinent in areas such as maternity support, the reconciliation of work and family life and special protection against crimes that are mainly committed against women and children, such as sexual exploitation, human trafficking or abuse."
"Finally, I would stress that any EU initiative in this area cannot attempt to give women the right to abortion in the name of sexual and reproductive health; this must remain a matter for the individual Member States alone to decide."
"Gender equality is a fundamental principle of the European Union, and is enshrined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"Thus, the Union has a specific mission of promoting and mainstreaming equality between men and women."
"There is no doubt that the unfortunate situation of gender discrimination continues to exist today, in both developing and developed countries - and, specifically, in the European Union - at all social, economic and cultural levels."
"To effectively combat this phenomenon, it is vital to ensure that there are effective mechanisms for identifying problems and collecting information without coming up against obstacles or political constraints, so as to establish causes and consequences in a clear and sustained way in order to effect a complete response."
"This structural problem is an obstacle to progress and the development of communities in particular, and humanity in general."
"I believe that eradicating domestic violence should be a top priority."
"In order to do this, it will be vital to ensure cultural, social and economic equality between men and women."
"The economic and financial crisis, the impact of climate change and an ageing society are all factors that the European Commission and the Member States must take into account in actions and policies that aim to promote gender equality."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today, 25 February 2010, voted in favour of the resolution on Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality,."
"We would, however, like to emphasise that we do not believe that a chapter on equality should be included in the revision of the Lisbon Strategy 2010, as this is already covered in the Treaty of Rome and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"We would also like to point out that we believe that women should have power over their sexuality and reproduction."
"We believe in the ability of individuals to make decisions concerning their own lives; the EU should not interfere in this area."
"Increased equality is one of the EU's great challenges where Sweden's progress can inspire the other Member States of the EU."
"I supported this resolution because, 15 years after the Beijing World Conference on Women, we have to acknowledge that too little progress has been made in relation to gender equality and that sexist stereotypes still persist in numerous areas such as employment, education and politics."
"I also supported the reference to the need to improve the sexual and reproductive health of women both in Europe and globally, and the encouragement that needs to be given to fathers to share family responsibilities, by taking advantage of parental leave, for example."
"Finally, with regard to the revision of the Lisbon Strategy, priority will have to be given to the gender equality goal, which will have to make a real impact in national social protection and inclusion measures."
"The objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action accepted 15 years ago have not been fulfilled to this day, and in most areas relating to equality between women and men, there has hardly been any slight measure of progress."
"It is unfortunate that at both Member State and European Union level, little emphasis is placed on combating the extreme poverty and multiple discriminations that afflict women."
"We need to harmonise much more closely the Beijing objectives adopted within the framework of the United Nations and the implementation of the new EU roadmap for equality between men and women."
"In this European year for combating poverty and social exclusion, it is particularly important that women who are barely above the poverty line should receive suitable protection, since a change in their employment or family situation - such as job loss, divorce, widowhood and even childbirth - means that the danger of impoverishment threatens them exponentially."
"It is gratifying that the programme of the Spanish-Belgian-Hungarian Trio Presidency places great emphasis, on the one hand, on following up on the implementation of the Beijing objectives, and, on the other, declares its intention to take a comprehensive approach to preventing and combating the poverty that affects women and children."
"These perspectives will, hopefully, also be addressed with due seriousness at the UN meeting scheduled for early March."
"In order to assess and review policies aimed at achieving equal opportunities between men and women, reliable data broken down by gender is necessary, and it would also be worth considering the introduction of standardised, common indicators for measuring gender inequality."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of paragraph 9 of the resolution on the Beijing +15 UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality, upholding women's sexual and reproductive health and rights."
"Sexual and reproductive rights are based on universally recognised rights to bodily integrity, non-discrimination, and the highest attainable standard of health."
"These rights are enshrined in international law (including Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights where States Parties recognise 'the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health' and Article 12 of the Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women on eliminating 'discrimination against women in the field of health care in order to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, access to health care services, including those related to family planning')."
"Consensus documents (such as the 1994 Cairo Programme of Action and 1995 Beijing Platform for Action) also illustrated governments' commitment to (women's) sexual and reproductive rights."
"Many in my electorate in Romania share this perspective."
"Inequalities between men and women on various levels, whether by profession, sector or various stereotypes, have become blurred over the years."
"Equality between men and women in the EU is increasingly a reality, and although there are still cases of discrimination, we are beginning to see very positive developments."
"The defence of women's rights is important to me, too."
"However, I do not consider the use of quotas, so-called positive discrimination, to be sensible."
"It is qualifications that should be decisive here, not gender."
"This should be the basic rule for men and women alike."
"It is for that reason that I abstained from voting."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution because it is compulsory to implement gender equality in all fields."
"Regarding Romania, these fifteen years, progress has been made only in some of the areas identified in the Beijing Platform for Action."
"The presence of women in Romanian politics on the level of decision making after the 2009 election is around 11% in the Parliament, and only one woman was appointed in the government."
"Male violence against women, human trafficking and women representation in decision-making bodies are priorities we should strongly address."
"We can address all this only if women will decide for women!"
"Not including women in all social and political executive bodies would be wasting 50% of intellectual capacity as well as failing in representing truly the interest of all citizens."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the final text of the resolution because it included our petitions to the EU Commission to take into account in its 2010-2014 roadmap not only the economic and financial crisis but also the impact of climate change on women; on the fact that inequality and gender stereotypes in the EU still persist with women remaining in a position subordinate to men in the areas addressed in the Beijing Platform; and because it promotes gender equality especially in terms of paternity leave."
"I voted for this resolution because it highlights the progress still to be made by the 189 states that are signatories to the Beijing Platform for Action if real equality between women and men is to be achieved."
"I particularly support the paragraph stressing that 'sexual and reproductive health and rights are an integral part of the women's rights agenda'."
"I would like to point out in this regard that, when my report on equality between women and men was adopted in 2009, the majority of MEPs supported the view that women had to have easy access to contraception and abortion."
"I, together with my colleagues from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, voted in favour of Mrs Svensson's report on Beijing +15 - UN Platform for Action for Gender Equality."
"Her assessment presents a mixed picture."
"True, progress has been made, but how can we be satisfied when there is still a gender wage differential of between 14% and 17.5%?"
"Furthermore, it is unacceptable that a majority of MEPs have adopted a highly ambiguous amendment tabled by the European Conservatives and Reformists implying that women who have recourse to abortion are not making an informed and responsible decision."
"This is an indirect attack on the right to abortion"
"in writing. - The Member States of the ECR have signed the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Beijing Platform for Action."
"We therefore feel that for the EU to 'become a party to the Convention' as a whole is unnecessary and we oppose the EU acting in this State-like way."
"Whilst the ECR Group places great importance on equality between all people, we oppose further legislation at EU level; we believe the gender equality issue is best driven at national level with the involvement of civil society within local communities."
"For these reasons, we have voted against the resolution."
"According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration."
"The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions."
"The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee."
"It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs' assistants are paid."
"The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this."
"Certainly, due to the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants' Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants."
"For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow."
"For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained."
"Presented for the first time in the meeting of the Committee on Budgets of 25 January 2010, the MaÅka report is characterised by three critical points, which are responsible for my decision to abstain from the vote."
"Firstly, the sudden and belated discovery, in respect of the signing of the 2010 budget in December 2009, that the 20% limit for expenditure under 'heading 5' had been exceeded."
"The agreement to shift the problem from December to January, the desire not to publicise the budgetary burden of the Treaty of Lisbon, and the hasty manner in which the issue was raised, without any scope to demand, where necessary, more efficient use of the resources currently available, have led to a real distortion of the facts."
"Secondly, I disagree with the decision to use the reserves earmarked for buildings policy to cover the new need for liquidity."
"This is a controversial issue that must be addressed in the coming months, once we are sure that we can count on having the necessary financial resources."
"Lastly, I believe that the sum of EUR 1 500 as a monthly allocation for Members' assistants seems inadequate, since the minimum threshold for the appointment of a new level I-accredited assistant is EUR 1 649."
"The Treaty of Lisbon means greater powers for Parliament."
"Nonetheless, in a globalised world, issues are increasingly complex, and decisions need to be technically sound and backed up by science."
"It is crucial that policy makers are aware of recent scientific developments, as these will allow them to make the best decisions."
"This budget makes decisions with cuts to the buildings heading and an increase in technical support for Members, providing the necessary resources for Parliament to perform its duties well, with the scientific and technical backing that is so necessary in the 21st century."
"I voted against this report, because the EU budget continues to constitute a minimum percentage of European GDP (0.97%), which does not cover the need to strengthen weak economies and societies and finance enlargement."
"The need for a bold increase in the budget, to at least 5%, is becoming more urgent, especially in the current economic crisis, which has hit the entire European Union, in order to address social needs and stop public spending cuts."
"It is within this framework that the problems of operational needs and the harmonisation of expenditure by the European Parliament and the European Union need to be addressed."
"According to the resolution of the European Parliament on the draft general budget for the financial year 2010, adopted on 17 December 2009, a vote was taken today on the amending budget for the European Parliament, following the revised calculations made by the Parliamentary administration."
"The FDP in the European Parliament abstained, because there was a paragraph in the package of amendments concerned that we could not reconcile with our convictions."
"The FDP had already expressed its opposition to an increase in the secretarial allowance to EUR 1 500 during the discussions in committee."
"It is out of the secretarial allowance that MEPs' assistants are paid."
"The FDP considers that the argument that more money is needed due to the additional work that MEPs have to do with the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is unsound, as there is nothing in past experience to support this."
"Certainly, under the Treaty of Lisbon, which has just come into force, Parliament will overall need extra capacity for legislative work, but with the introduction of the Assistants' Statute from the beginning of the current parliamentary term, there is still no proof that MEPs actually need more assistants."
"For this reason, there are grounds for concern that further demands and supplementary increases, or an extension of office capacity, will follow."
"For this reason, the FDP in the European Parliament abstained from voting."
"in writing. - I voted for the MaÅka Report which is the first step in amending the 2010 European Parliament budget seeking additional budgetary and human resources to enable the European Parliament to fulfil its enhanced role."
"The additional resources include an increase in the monthly assistance allowance available to MEPs to support their increased legislative role under the Lisbon Treaty."
"The Lisbon Treaty puts the Parliament on an equal footing with the Council as colegislator accounting for some 95% of legislative procedures."
"It now includes such areas as freedom, security and justice, agriculture, fisheries, research and structural funds."
"Parliament's consent must also now be given for the negotiation and conclusion of international agreements which require detailed expert examination."
"It is essential that MEPs have the staff necessary to do this work as required."
"We Swedish Social Democrats believe that those committees that will gain a heavier workload with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon need to be reinforced."
"This justifies an increase in staff for Parliament's and the groups' secretariats in these committees."
"However, we do not share the view that we MEPs need more staff."
"Above all, we would have liked to have seen Parliament's resources being increased by means of redistributions and measures to increase efficiency, rather than the total budget being increased."
"Given the new role of Parliament within the context of the Treaty of Lisbon and its new functions, and in view of the commitment made when the 2010 budget was approved, this increase in funds available for the running of Parliament makes sense, as it ensures that this body has all the material and human resources it needs to fulfil its new tasks in the new institutional framework with accuracy and excellence."
"This increase in funds must not, however, jeopardise budgetary sustainability and the accuracy of financial statements, as this is crucial in any institution."
"Additionally, there must be accuracy and transparency in managing the funds made available under this budget."
"This amending budget for the financial year 2010 relating to Parliament's budget (Section 1 of the general EU budget) now has a value of EUR 1 616 760 399, which represents 19.99% of the initial heading 5, adopted at first reading."
"In this amending budget, we have reduced the buildings reserve from EUR 15 million to EUR 11 million."
"The need for this budget has come about as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Parliament is taking on new powers and new responsibilities."
"Our priority now is excellence in legislation."
"In order to secure this, it is important to provide the Members, committees and political groups with sufficient means."
"This amending budget fulfils legal and budgetary standards and good financial discipline."
"As the rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for this budget, I believe that budgetary discipline and trying to make savings is necessary now more than ever, throughout its implementation."
"I can therefore reaffirm the importance of developing a zero-based budget that will ensure further rigour and transparency, and I also appeal for information regarding Parliament's fixed expenditure as a matter of urgency."
"I must also insist on the need for long-term planning in buildings policy, with a view to ensuring budgetary sustainability."
"Yesterday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Athens, and Greece was paralysed by a general strike in protest against the austerity plan imposed by the EU, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt and the IMF."
"It is true to say that Greece has not always been as rigorous as it should have been in the management of its public accounts and EU funds."
"However, it is scandalous that the main virtue of this austerity plan should be that it reassures the markets, these same markets that are currently speculating on the Greek debt and which caused this turmoil."
"These same markets from which the States, thanks to your ultra-liberal laws, have to borrow at high rates of interest."
"At the same time, under the pretext of an alleged increase in workload due to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and of Parliament's supposed concern about the quality of its legislative texts, the MEPs are awarding themselves a 'small' budget increase to the tune of a few million euros so that staff can be recruited for the political groups!"
"Therefore, apply your nit-picking checks to your own expenditure and be as rigorous as you insist the Member States must be!"
"We will be voting against this text."
"The crisis is here, and it is true that a large number of companies and citizens are struggling."
"Nevertheless, I voted in favour of an increase in the parliamentary assistance package because the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon increases the responsibilities of the European Parliament: we have more work and more obligations to fulfil on behalf of our citizens."
"This increase will only benefit our assistants;"
"MEPs themselves will not see any increase in their salaries."
"in writing. - Along with my group, I gave conditional support today for an increase in the secretarial allowance at this stage in the procedure."
"This support is conditional on the evaluation of the use of this allowance, as called for in the MaÅka report."
"Our final position on the increased allowance will be contingent on the outcome of this evaluation."
"I confidently voted for this budget amendment."
"It is not a case of us asking for money for ourselves, as alleged by the press."
"However, we need to provide the institution of the European Parliament with the necessary resources to meet European citizens' expectations of this forum."
"I know that we are not only going through a hard time economically, but that the budget restrictions in many states are also huge."
"This budget is not even extravagant."
"Savings have been made and will continue to be made."
"I voted for the MaÅka report, although I did not agree with the budget increase in the secretarial allowance for MEPs."
"In her explanation of our vote, Mrs TrÃ¼pel, who is the responsible member on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, put it on record on behalf of the whole group that our vote in favour is conditional on there being an evaluation of the secretarial allowance before the increase is put into effect."
"I consider both the other points - namely the increase in posts for committees and groups - to be sensible and necessary as a consequence of Parliament's new legislative powers under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We Members wish to and will take these powers very seriously and thereby do justice to our role as the only elected representatives of European citizens."
"in writing. - The approval and subsequent entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon have meant increased responsibility for Parliament, with the administrative burden that that entails."
"Given that legislative excellence is a priority for Parliament, the Members need to be given the material and human resources to make this a reality."
"This new budget must, however, respect the utilisation rates of the values under heading 5 (administrative provisions) of the multiannual financial framework (MFF), which were fixed at 20% of the value of that heading, so as to maintain budgetary sustainability."
"In view of all the cuts being made throughout Europe, we need to show solidarity with those countries that finance the EU budget by not increasing our expenditure and I am therefore voting against the proposal for an amending budget concerning the European Parliament."
"I voted against this report as it envisages an increase in the envelope for recruitment of and allowances for assistants by EUR 1 500 per month from 1 May 2010."
"Fortunately, an amendment tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance provides for an evaluation of the system of allowances, in force since the 2009 elections, as it currently exists."
"Yet the increase in the secretarial assistance allowance is to take effect unconditionally, with no obligation to take account of the results of this evaluation."
"The report also envisages a strengthening of the parliamentary committees and the political groups."
"This operation costs EUR 13.3 million on an annual basis, EUR 8.832 million of which is for assistants' allowances."
"This is a bad decision."
"It damages the reputation of this institution."
"It has not been thought through."
"No thought has been given to any further consequences."
"Where are the new assistants to be accommodated?"
"Will it be in a new building?"
"Will yet more costs be incurred?"
"In addition, I fear that this money will be used in large part for the recruitment of non-accredited assistants under national wage terms."
"That very system has given rise to dirty tricks in some cases."
"Now we may be leaving the door wide open to abuse."
"Therefore, I urge a clear evaluation of the existing system in advance; only then can we take an informed decision."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has led to the adoption of a proposal to amend the 2010 budget, with a view to meeting the additional needs of Parliament in relation to it."
"Given that legislative excellence is a priority for Parliament, I would emphasise the importance of providing the Members, committees and political groups with the necessary means to achieve this objective, along with the means to cover their overall needs in relation to the long-term buildings policy."
"Therefore, the amending budget for the financial year of 2010 now has a value of EUR 1 616 760 399, which represents 19.99% of the initial heading 5, adopted at first reading, and the buildings reserve has been reduced from EUR 15 million to EUR 11 million."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of the report's inclusion of the establishment of a zero-based budget, which ensures greater budgetary sustainability, and the need for this to be in accordance with the annual legislative programme."
"For the aforementioned reasons, I voted in favour of the document, which will allow Parliament to be given sufficient means to cover the expenses related to its new role following the Treaty of Lisbon."
"in writing. - The Greens/EFA Group gives conditional support to an increase in the secretarial assistance allowance at this stage of the procedure."
"For our group, the evaluation of the use of the secretarial allowance as asked for in the MaÅka report is crucial."
"This evaluation should come in time for a decision by the budgetary authority on the corresponding amending budget later in spring."
"The group may reconsider its support for the increase in the assistants' allowance in view of the outcome of this evaluation and discussions within our group."
"I would really like to endorse the MEPs and, at the same time, express my concern that particularly at the time of the crisis, various allowances to both MEPs and employees in their teams are being increased."
"In particular, I would like to draw attention to those categories of expenses which are difficult to monitor or are not monitored at all. Precisely these categories of expenses should not be increased during the crisis."
"The report supports the EU common fisheries policy which, in the name of protecting fish stocks, has resulted in the destruction of a large number of small fishing boats in Greece and in numerous small and medium-sized fishing enterprises being ousted from the profession, in the condemnation of numerous coastal areas to abandonment and unemployment and in the concentration of activities in the hands of large fishing companies."
"The monopoly friendly nature of EU policy is illustrated by the fact that 2/3 of Community funds have been channelled to big business (fishing companies, fish farms, processing), while the remaining 1/3 has been given to poor and middling fishermen to break up their boats and leave the profession."
"Measures to replace/improve vessels have only benefited large companies."
"The report, like the Green Paper, apportions equal responsibility for the reduction in fish stocks to large fishing companies and small-scale coastal fisheries."
"It does not differentiate between the measures needed in fisheries areas and overlooks their individual peculiarities."
"The EU common fisheries policy serves the ambitions of the big fishing companies that will remain to plunder the wealth of the seas and supports big business in the fish farming sector."
"This policy, the only criterion for which is the profitability of capital, is resulting in the destruction of the marine environment and of ecosystems."
"I welcome the launch of a new strategy aimed at resolving the issues relating to fishing in the European Union."
"Overfishing, illegal fishing, pollution and climate change are factors which are jeopardising marine ecosystems."
"This is why the concern for high-quality aquaculture in Europe will yield economic benefits and also ecological benefits at the same time."
"It is vital for us to maintain the right balance between economic growth, fishing traditions in certain regional communities and the best fishing practices."
"The most important thing is for us to realise that the promotion of aquaculture which is sustainable and economically efficient in the long term is primarily dependent on how environmentally friendly we are."
"The fishing sector in Europe is experiencing hard times."
"Fishermen are losing their only source of livelihood, and this is particularly true in those EU regions where there are few social and economic alternatives."
"Therefore, I support wholeheartedly the Commission's proposal, set out in the Green Paper, that it is necessary to fundamentally and comprehensively reform fishing policy, thereby adapting this sector to the changing market."
"It is regrettable, but 27 years have passed since the creation of the common fisheries policy and this sector is not working as it should and problems are not being solved quickly enough."
"The problems of 2002 still remain and they have been aggravated even more by the latest events, linked to the economic crisis and the impact of climate change on fish stocks."
"The priorities of the reform of the common fisheries policy must remain the restoration of stocks, sustainable management and securing the subsistence level of fishermen."
"Fishing is very important to the whole of the EU, therefore it should not simply be seen as an activity, but as a sector which is a direct source of employment."
"in writing. - While this report points to a rather less awful CFP than the monstrosity we have now, it nevertheless recommends leaving fisheries under the predatory control of the undemocratic and anti-democratic 'European Union', and, for this reason, cannot be endorsed by UKIP."
"The promotion of a common interest among producer organisations in observing the principles advocated by the European Union is becoming a key element in reforming the fisheries policy."
"The European Union cannot expect Europe's fishing fleets to be resized naturally, based on economic realities."
"Their overcapacity, eight years after the global summit on sustainable development, and the continuing decline in fish stocks, are additional reasons for a far-reaching reform of the common fisheries policy."
"However, it must not be forgotten that there are whole communities located in the coastal regions of the European Union's states whose existence revolves around fishing."
"As is also mentioned in the report on the reform of the common fisheries policy, this activity is part of the cultural heritage and traditions which no one wants to see lost."
"A review of the common fisheries policy is in every Member State's interest so that the main objective adopted at the 2012 summit, which is to attain the level of fish stocks enabling maximum sustainable yield by 2015, can be met, thereby ensuring that the European Union is no longer obliged to import half of the fish it needs from other markets."
"The fisheries sector is strategically important for the socio-economic wellbeing of coastal communities, local development, employment, and the preservation and creation of economic activity."
"Ensuring sustainable development within this sector is vital, both on an economic and social level, but it is equally necessary to ensure the conservation of good environmental conditions in all EU marine waters."
"The implementation of the CFP is directly linked to issues such as environmental protection, climate change, safety, public health, protecting consumers and regional development, internal and international trade, relations with third countries and development cooperation, and it is essential to ensure a proper and careful balance between all these areas."
"I would like to emphasise the need for a coherent European Research Area framework in support of a sustainable use of oceans and seas."
"It is also important to consider the nature of the constraints affecting the outermost regions which, by reason of their permanent and pervasive character and joint presence, differentiate those regions from the Union's other regions with geographical disadvantages and/or demographic problems."
"I voted against the report on the common fisheries policy, despite the fact that it contains a number of elements that represent a positive development compared with the current situation."
"Unfortunately, however, basic points of the report clash with the fact that marine resources are common public property which cannot be privatised and an amendment by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left on this point was rejected."
"This particular report fails to combine the necessary protection of the marine environment, conservation of fish stocks and social and financial protection for fishermen, especially small-scale fishermen, with catastrophic consequences for the environment and viable fisheries and an adverse impact on both fishermen and consumers, who have to pay the final price for the product, with the profits benefiting large private companies rather than small-scale fishermen."
"The report does not succeed in taking real account of the various conditions prevailing in individual EU Member States and, consequently, does not succeed in making provision for the necessary, duly adjusted policies."
"I wish to congratulate Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves on her excellent report on the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"The countless problems and challenges with the CFP were identified back in 2002, but have now been exacerbated by the economic and energy crises and by the damaging effects of climate change."
"If the CFP is to serve the interests of modern fisheries, it needs to introduce a set of thorough changes which will ensure a fair balance between the preservation of resources and the viability of the sector, opening the door to new management systems for the different types of fisheries within the EU."
"I welcome the concern to decentralise and de-bureaucratise the CFP, and to regionalise fishery management within the limits set by the Treaty of Lisbon, and also the need to ensure that treatment is tailored to small-scale coastal fisheries and industrial fisheries, whilst respecting environmental, economic and social requirements."
"I would also stress the protection of the interests of Community fisheries."
"However, these require appropriate monitoring by national governments, which should make fisheries a strategic priority in order to ensure the economic and social viability of coastal communities."
"I believe that plans need to be drawn up for managing and supporting the long-term recovery of fish stocks for all types of fishing and all geographical fishing zones within the European Union."
"Consideration must be given, first and foremost, to the huge differences which exist in Europe in terms of fishing."
"Greater responsibility must be given to fishing zones and improvements made to the traditional quota system."
"Europe needs to adopt a strong, joint approach to managing fisheries resources, which will include a continental and market dimension for the sector, as well as a catching sector and aquaculture, in accordance with the European Union's new integrated maritime policy and with its interest in sustainable growth in coastal regions."
"in writing. - While this report points to a rather less awful CFP than the monstrosity we have now, it nevertheless recommends leaving fisheries under the predatory control of the undemocratic and anti-democratic 'European Union', and, for this reason, cannot be endorsed by UKIP."
"I voted in favour of the report on the Green Paper on the reform to the common fisheries policy because it made essential commitments that clearly helped to improve the initial proposal."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of introducing an environmental and social approach in seeking new management systems for fisheries resources, which will complement the current system, based on the principle of relative stability."
"We Swedish Social Democrats voted against the report on the Green Paper and the reform of the EU fisheries policy."
"The majority in Parliament rejected the prioritising of ecological sustainability and voted in favour of an amendment stating that our policy towards countries outside the EU should be governed by the interests of European fisheries."
"We find this unacceptable and therefore elected to vote 'no'."
"We are also sceptical about the fact that the European Parliament wants to provide more money for the common fisheries policy - this is something that we do not wish to be involved in, unless the purpose is to make a clear change to the policy."
"I would like to begin by highlighting the excellent report produced by Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves."
"Fishing communities are currently undergoing a difficult period, marked by severe deterioration in fish stocks."
"This activity has an impact on the food supply for the general population and on the cohesion of the outermost regions of the European Union."
"For this reason, there needs to be an integrated and comprehensive approach to the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"I believe that it is urgent and vital for the European Union to engage effectively in ensuring better conditions of economic sustainability for fishermen, within a framework that can safeguard the specific features of each region and that recognises that a different approach is required for small-scale fisheries."
"It is worth pointing out the recommendation of concrete measures such as the reduction in the number of middlemen in the chain between the producer and the consumer."
"On the other hand, this reform cannot be isolated from the sustainable use of marine resources in a technical and scientific process of assessment that has been thoroughly checked, and which will contribute to the conciliation of the sector and have a bearing on quality and food security for consumers."
"Within the context of changing the capacity of fisheries, I would like to emphasise the impact of modernising equipment on the professional dignity and safety of fishermen in a sector where loss of life is common."
"The rejection by a majority in Parliament of the proposals that we tabled here, turning down the privatisation of fisheries resources, is indicative of the route that it is attempting to follow with the forthcoming reform of the CFP."
"Parliament not only fails to reject the Commission's proposal for the creation of (private) property rights for access to use a public good to be imposed; it also opens the way for that intention to be made official."
"This is an option that does not safeguard the sustainability of resources and it will inevitably lead to a concentration of activity among entities with greater economic and financial power all over the EU, seriously threatening small-scale, coastal fisheries that, in the case of Portugal, represent more than 90% of the fleet."
"We did note some positive points in the report, some of which corresponded with the proposals that we tabled, but we cannot fail to note that overall, the report sticks to a markedly liberal approach, and one which greatly limits the sovereignty of the Member States over their marine resources."
"It also fails to provide a thorough response to one of the main issues that the sector is facing: income from work."
"We can but point out the rejection of the proposals that we tabled, aimed at improving marketing in the sector, which would increase the remuneration for the fishermen's work."
"in writing. - I am supportive of extending the coastal limits from 12 to 20 miles as one of the key reforms of the CFP."
"We must also end the practice of discarding vulnerable stocks."
"It is important to retain the current quota management system and I do not support mandatory privatisation of quotas."
"in writing. - The report contained many good and important elements and there is a consensus that the centralised, one-size-fits-all model of the CFP has been a disaster."
"A number of amendments tabled by myself were successful and thus, the report recognises relative stability, the need to incentivise conservation efforts and the success that has been national control within the 12-mile zone."
"However, the report goes on to state that historical rights should be reviewed."
"Fisheries management must be returned to the fishing nations; those fishing nations must not lose their historical rights."
"I therefore voted against a report which invites an attack on such fundamental traditional rights of access to fish stocks."
"A fundamental and comprehensive reform of the common fisheries policy (CFP) is to be welcomed, particularly with a view to the sustainable management of fish resources."
"This is to be enabled by refining and standardising the framework conditions, better controls on the part of the Member States, and simplifying the decision-making system."
"Even though Austria, as an inland country, is not directly concerned, the steadily growing consumption of sea fish is influencing fishing."
"We need practical and efficient solutions that offer the sector a basis for sufficient viability through good stock conditions, ensure supply to consumers and, at the same time, guarantee the maintenance of species diversity and safeguard the marine ecosystem as a whole."
"in writing. - This report is a broad document that covers all the aspects of the CFP, from aquaculture to angling, from the Baltic Sea to fisheries agreements with third world countries."
"The Greens are happy about many of the amendments to the report that we managed to get accepted, such as fundamental principles on demands for sustainability on those that will have the right to fish, demands of environmental impact assessments on fisheries operations, the statement that the EU should not compete with local fishermen under the fisheries agreements, but only be allowed to fish from a surplus of fish, and also the motion to all EU institutions to put illegal fishing on top of the international agenda in all relevant fora, to protect the oceans as well as food security."
"Unfortunately, there were also some completely unacceptable and contradictory paragraphs approved in the final text, such as the objective of the external parts of the CFP is to protect and promote European fisheries interests, that ecological sustainability should not be prioritised over social and economical sustainability and that all policy areas should contribute to fulfilling the CFP's objectives."
"This is why the Green group could not support the report, but abstained."
"in writing. - (PT) The common fisheries policy, which was last revised in 2002, is not yet sufficient to weather the vicissitudes of this sensitive sector."
"For this reason, it is necessary to analyse the new factors that are affecting the sector and find new solutions to make it completely viable, particularly in economic, social and environmental terms."
"I therefore recommend that new measures be taken to allow the fishing sector to escape from its current perilous situation."
"The fisheries industry is very important in the EU."
"It is therefore vital that the new CFP takes account of the rational and responsible management of resources, and that it concerns itself with protecting marine resources and maintaining the way of life of those who have always earned their living from fishing."
"The new CFP needs to be capable of resolving productivity problems within the sector, stabilising markets and ensuring a good standard of living for families who are dependent on this sector."
"However, this sector should be analysed as a whole, not in sections, so that we can integrate all its problems and vicissitudes in order to resolve them to the satisfaction of all those involved, and overcome the main problems affecting it: overfishing, overcapacity, overinvestment and wastage."
"That fishing has a long tradition in Europe, and, one hopes, also will have in the future, is welcome."
"Developments in these last few years certainly indicate that working in this sector of the economy is becoming fundamentally less attractive."
"The reason for this is that groups of companies with their masses of fish products are pushing retail prices down so far that small fishing businesses cannot compete."
"As a result of these circumstances, this sector is increasingly becoming the province of workers from third countries."
"On account of the fact that this motion for a resolution does not sufficiently deal with this issue, I voted against it."
"in writing. - I abstained in the final vote on the Neves PatrÃ£o report because it contained both positive and negative paragraphs."
"In one side, agrees that priority access should be given to those who fish in the most environmentally sustainable way, leading to fewer discards, more jobs and less energy use, and stresses that the right to fish must be based on environmental and social criteria, rather than on who caught the most fish 30 years ago."
"It is years of overfishing that has led to the current crisis, so it is absurd to let the same fleets continue the damage."
"Other positive points include making ecological sustainability the basic premise of the CFP and the recognition that EU fleets must no longer overfish in the waters of developing countries."
"Unfortunately, less constructive ideas are also in the report, such as a refusal to accept the destructive influence of subsidies."
"The report also declares the CFP to be the dominant policy in the EU, with environment and development policies being subservient to it."
"It is this 'preserve the fishing industry at all costs' attitude that has led to the destruction of the marine ecosystem and the fishing communities that depend upon it."
"The German members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe voted differently from the group as a whole on two points."
"The first concerns Amendment 3 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"The FDP members voted against, because a radical devolution of fisheries policy such as proposed in the motion with the transfer of powers and responsibility to Member States and to local decision makers cannot be reconciled with the European common fisheries policy."
"The idea here is precisely to find common forward-looking solutions at an EU level."
"FDP members supported Amendment 33 because it supports the important principle of relative stability, which is important for Germans."
"This concerns the basis for quota allocation."
"The European fishing industry is sailing through troubled waters: fish stocks are plummeting, 400 000 European fishermen and their families are worrying about their future and wondering about the effectiveness of the common fisheries policy (CFP) which, until now, has provided them with a safety net."
"In the light of the structural problems identified, namely overfishing, underinvestment, overcapacity of the fishing fleet and waste (how many tonnes of fish are discarded into the sea every day because they are not fit for consumption?), reform of the CFP must be a top priority."
"Clearly, any reform must take account of the individual features of the various fishing areas and avoid at all costs a one-size-fits-all management model."
"The fishing techniques and vessels used in the North Sea are quite different from those used in the Gulf of Gascony."
"That is why the reform proposed by the Commission, which is based on regionalisation and which was adopted by Parliament this afternoon, is essential."
"A responsible policy must also take account of the reality as presented by the figures: the EU accounts for approximately 4.5% of world fishing production and does not aspire to become a 'giant' in the sector."
"This is yet another reason why we must opt for small-scale, innovative and sustainable fishing."
"in writing. - The Commission's Green Paper on this issue was a damning indictment and an honest recognition that the common fisheries policy has not worked."
"On the contrary, it has contributed to a variety of problems which continue to have economic, social and environmental impacts."
"Only two weeks ago, this House voted in favour of suspending international trade in bluefin tuna because of the critically low stocks - a situation which is yet another sign that our current levels of fishing are unsustainable and have serious consequences for biodiversity and the future of the fishing sector."
"We must recognise that a new approach is needed."
"A decentralised policy with more funding will allow different regions to adapt and respond to their own circumstances - something that the previous 'top-down' policy prevented."
"This should lead to better management of stocks and have a positive effect on the marine environment."
"I fully support the Commission's commitment to whole-scale and fundamental reform, which has been rightly backed by the Committee on Fisheries."
"It is vital that we act to ensure that the European Union implements a truly sustainable fishing policy in order to protect stocks, the environment, and European jobs in the long term."
"in writing. - I supported amendments put forward to change the common fisheries policy in a way which would have ended some of the distortions that exist already."
"Increasing any funding for renewal of fleets or setting prices for fish centrally are particularly distorting and allow for increased use of subsidies."
"Fishermen in the UK, particularly along the south coast in the 10 metre boats, are often badly affected by imbalanced quotas and subsidies to other national fishing fleets."
"Hastings and Rye MP, Mike Foster, has brought to my attention the need for the Marine Fishing Agency and the Commission to end discriminatory and distorting practices, especially in the catching of cod along the UK south coast, and particularly his own constituency Hastings and Rye, which we both represent."
"I abstained from the vote on the report on the common fisheries policy as it contains too many points that not only conflict with a number of other points in the report but also run counter to my political perspective on European fisheries policy."
"On the one hand, the report says that European fishing fleets may no longer overfish the waters of developing countries, but on the other, it says that the common fisheries policy always takes precedence over environmental and development policies."
"This position is patently at variance with the Treaty of Lisbon, Article 208 of which states that our foreign policy must not undermine the development objectives of poor countries."
"The policy proposed by Parliament most certainly benefits Europe, but outside European waters, Europe is championing only its own fishing fleets and not the local fish stocks and fishermen."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has therefore abstained."
"In addition, whilst the report does recognise that there is a serious problem of overfishing and that sustainability must form the starting point for the policy, it fails to recognise that fleet capacity and the subsidy and quota systems are at the root of this problem."
"That explains our abstention."
"The report on the Green Paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy, which we adopted today, revises the economic, social and environmental aspects of this policy, with the aim of redefining the approach to resolving the remaining problems within the sector."
"I would like to reiterate that priorities such as greater efficiency in managing fishery resources and a financial support strategy for those who work in this sector, along with a guarantee of sustainability in the sector through the preservation of species, are essential in this reform, and they must be implemented at regional level."
"This document insists on reforms needed for the fishing industry, and which are enormously important in the outermost regions, particularly Madeira, where this activity is greatly important in local development and in the lives of the local people."
"I would like to reiterate the ideas in the report relating to more active participation by the various actors at a national, regional and local level in terms of implementation and the technical measures to be taken within the fisheries sector."
"For all the above reasons, I voted in favour of this report, which will mark the beginning of a new stage in the European common fisheries policy."
"I voted against Mrs PatrÃ£o Neves's report because it rejects the amendments intended to establish a balance between environmental interests and the preservation of small-scale fisheries."
"I also deplore the rejection of the amendments calling for an in-depth dialogue to be established with fishermen prior to this reform."
"On this basis, I do not see how it will be possible to adopt a reform that is acceptable to fishermen and that does what needs to be done to preserve a common fisheries policy worthy of the name."
"The minutes of this sitting will be tabled for approval by Parliament at the start of the next sitting."
"If there are no objections, I shall immediately pass the motions adopted at today's sitting to the persons and agencies to which they are addressed."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"

"Adjournment of the session"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 25 February 2010."
"Statements by the President"
"I have several things to say at the beginning of the session."
"In opening this plenary session of the European Parliament, once again I have to inform you of several tragic natural disasters which have occurred in recent days."
"Today, there was an earthquake in Turkey in which at least 57 people died."
"Last week, there was also an earthquake in Chile, which claimed nearly 300 victims, and storms raging across Europe caused the deaths of over 60 people, most of whom were citizens of France."
"Furthermore, we should not forget Haiti, where the latest toll of victims of the earthquake in January is now in excess of 300 000 people."
"In all these cases, I have sent condolences and expressions of sympathy, on behalf of the European Parliament, to the victims' families."
"Every unexpected and premature death is, more than anything, a tragedy for the families concerned, but when victims are numbered in tens or hundreds of thousands, it is also a tragedy for entire nations and the whole world."
"Let us join in solidarity with the families and also send expressions of solidarity to the countries which have been hit by such a tragedy."
"Thursday, 11 March marks the 20th anniversary of the restoration of Lithuanian independence."
"Lithuania was the first country of the Soviet bloc to declare independence from the USSR."
"Among the Lithuanian Members of the European Parliament, there are four signatories of the declaration of independence of 1990."
"Congratulations to our fellow Members from Lithuania."
"(Applause)"
"Also, on 11 March 1990, the Congress of Estonia, a democratic, provisional parliament, adopted a declaration of reestablishment of the state after 50 years of Soviet occupation."
"We also congratulate our fellow Members from Estonia."
"(Applause)"
"Wednesday, 10 March marks the 51st anniversary of the popular uprising in Tibet."
"As a result of the uprising, the Dalai Lama and 80 000 Tibetans had to leave their country."
"We continue to hope, and we regularly appeal to the authorities of the People's Republic of China, to change their attitude to the Tibetan nation and to begin a fruitful dialogue with its representatives."
"(Applause)"
"In relation to remarks made by Mr Farage during the last plenary mini-session and pursuant to Rule 153(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I have spoken to Mr Farage and have decided to penalise him by withholding his daily subsistence allowance for a period of 10 days."
"(Applause)"
"I would also like to inform you about something else, about another theft which has taken place."
"The theft was suffered by a Member in the proximity of the European Parliament's premises."
"For quite some time now, I have been engaged in talks with representatives of the authorities in Brussels, and also with the Belgian authorities."
"Our fellow Member, Mrs Durant, is acting as go-between in these talks, because she knows the situation in Brussels and in Belgium very well."
"Our current plan, together with the Commission and the European Council, is that we want to create a special zone around the premises of all three institutions, in which security will be provided not only by the authorities in Brussels, but also by the Belgian Government and the central authorities in Belgium."
"Intensive talks are under way on this matter."
"Meetings were held about it last week, straight after the theft, and more will be held in the next few days."
"An official meeting with the police has been arranged for 22 March. I would also like to tell you that we are working very hard to improve security around the premises of the European Parliament, as well as other European institutions, not just Parliament."
"We are treating this as a matter which concerns us all."

"The final draft agenda drawn up on Thursday, 4 March 2010 by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday:"
"No changes."
"Tuesday:"
"No changes."
"Wednesday:"
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left have made a request to add a Commission statement on the 'Amflora' variety of genetically modified potato."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have once again moved for the subject of the licensing of the genetically modified potato Amflora to be put on the agenda for various reasons."
"After the Commissioner for Health became responsible for the licensing of genetically modified organisms, in my opinion, citizens thought that we would now approach the licensing of such GMOs with greater care."
"The opposite is the case."
"So soon after the Commission took office, I consider it a scandal that by licensing the potato, the Commissioner for Health has explicitly ignored the concerns of the World Health Organisation."
"Moreover, in the previous legislative period, time and again, there was great disagreement between the Council and the Commission on the licensing procedures, because many Member States did not agree with the licensing offensive that Commission President Barroso himself promoted."
"We had agreed to develop another prudent procedure for licensing."
"Where is this procedure now?"
"Since the majority of citizens are against these genetically modified organisms, we have a duty to hold a debate this week on this licensing and the offensive that is perhaps still trundling towards us."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I would like to ask for a roll-call vote on this."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apart from any possible assessments by individual Members or political groups, I believe it is appropriate that we should be able to deliver an opinion on such an important issue."
"We often discuss issues that are a very long way from the European Union, although they are relevant."
"This is an issue that concerns us and concerns our voters, and for that reason, I believe we should put it on the agenda."
"(DE) Mr President, I share the concerns of my fellow Member, Mrs Harms, and in many Member States, we are having an extremely heated debate on this issue."
"For that reason, as early as last week in the Conference of Presidents, I said what I would like to repeat now; there is no point in having a rushed debate now without a resolution, which then fails again."
"It makes much more sense to call on the competent committee to appoint a rapporteur to deal with the process and also the technical background of the approval procedure."
"The approval of the Commission has an eight-year lead time."
"Eight years was spent on this issue."
"The decision was made in the Commission on the basis of European law with decision by majority."
"The question we must now consider is whether decisions with such a scope should be subject to a right to opt-out by Parliament and whether, in the end, there is the opportunity for Parliament to retract such a far-reaching decision."
"For this reason, a rapporteur should be appointed to check the mechanisms and, if necessary, present a report, with the goal of reaching a legislative majority in Parliament which forces the Commission to table a legislative proposal within a year on the basis of our interinstitutional agreement."
"I consider this far better than such a rushed debate."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Please keep to the rules."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, these are one-minute statements, and this applies both to statements in support of the request and to statements against."
"Please do not speak for longer, because this disrupts the order of business and contravenes the Rules of Procedure."
"Please remember this."
"I have received a request from the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, and also from Mrs Harms, for a roll-call vote."
"We will take the vote now."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"International Women's Day"
"The next item is the statement by the President on International Women's Day."
"Women's Day in Europe is, today, a different day from the one we remember, at least in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Nowadays, it is not only a matter of giving flowers to women we know."
"Today, Women's Day is also an opportunity for important debates on equality, support for mothers in families with many children and ending violence against women."
"The European Parliament is actively involved in these debates."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is an extremely important committee."
"In November 2009, we adopted a resolution on the elimination of violence against women in which we call on the European Commission and Member States to establish consistent programmes of action against this form of violence."
"It is our ambition that the European Union will be able to set an example to the whole world in this matter."
"Women deserve more, today, because we do want, after all, to save Europe from demographic collapse, but this must not be done at the expense of women."
"Mothers of three or four children must have the possibility of employment and promotion on the same principles as men."
"Widely available nurseries and kindergartens, as well as jobs, are only one of the ways of achieving this objective."
"On the other hand, however, mothers who wish to remain at home with their children should also have the opportunity to do this, for example, by a suitable system of taxation based on the whole family, and not only on the two spouses."
"Our objective is to achieve full equality where this is possible and where this is essential, in other words - everywhere."
"Discrimination at work and in society must become history."
"In the European Union, women and men are of equal dignity and have equal rights, and defence of these rights is a job for us, too, for the European Parliament."
"My wish for all ladies present in the European Parliament is that every day could be their day, so that they would never feel victims of discrimination, and that there would be more and more of you ladies and fellow Members in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, as you have said, today is International Women's Day."
"It is the hundredth anniversary of that occasion."
"Is this cause for celebration?"
"We have achieved a great deal, but we still have a long way to go; and we can only do this if all of us - women and men - work together."
"This year, one theme of International Women's Day is women's solidarity and assertiveness the world over: an important theme at a time of economic crisis."
"It provides guidance for men and women to work together towards a better future for ourselves and our children, as only together can we ensure that women and men are equal not only before the law but also in their day-to-day lives and in economic and social life."
"After all, women make up approximately 50% of the world's population but their earnings account for only 10% of worldwide income."
"Only 5% of world leaders are women."
"Women account for 75% of the world's poor."
"This can, and must, be greatly improved."
"Yet this is not just about poverty."
"Looking at other parts of the world, in particular - large parts of Asia, for example - boys are more highly regarded than girls; they yield more for the family."
"This results in daughters being abandoned and even female foetuses being aborted."
"Sadly, trafficking in women is also a familiar and frequent phenomenon."
"In Africa, many young women and girls are victims of war and rape."
"There are many underlying cultural causes and these too must be accorded great importance if the position of women is to be improved."
"Women and girls suffer oppression, particularly in Muslim countries, where there are underlying religious causes."
"That is why it is important that we, the European Union, also highlight equality between girls and boys and between men and women in our aid programmes and our international relations."
"Therefore, this is about not only poverty reduction but also the dismantling of cultural prejudices."
"Herein lies an important task for the High Representative, Commission Vice-President Ashton, and also for Commissioner Georgieva."
"Yet there is also a great deal of work still to be done closer to home, and indeed even in our group, particularly with the support of our Chair, Mr Daul."
"I should like to devote my closing remark to ourselves here in the European Union."
"It all starts at a young age, during a child's education, and access to education is still not guaranteed for girls in Europe."
"The access rate should be 100% in our civilisation."
"This should be an important objective of the new EU 2020 strategy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a society in which men and women do not have equal rights in work and life is not a democratic and humane society."
"The basic prerequisite for justice in society is that it is administered regardless of a person's gender."
"That is something we men take for granted, not so women, even in Central European societies, not by a long shot."
"That is seen most clearly in one of the greatest scandals which I believe we must rid ourselves of as soon as possible."
"As Parliament, we could make a significant contribution to this."
"Really, how can a society rightly maintain it is equal if men and women receive different pay for the same work in the same place?"
"Nowhere is the discrimination of women in this society more frequently accepted without comment than in places of work, where women do the same work as men, to some extent, under far more extreme living conditions, and receive largely 30% or 40% less pay for it."
"We must rid the EU of this shame."
"If we here in Europe are to send out a message on International Women's Day, let it be equal pay for equal work in the same workplace, for both men and women."
"That is a central requirement of social justice."
"(Applause)"
"We have acknowledged that the Commission is making an effort."
"We can see that today, the European Charter on Women's Rights is about to get off the ground."
"That is good and we welcome it."
"However, we are a little disappointed and I ask you to pass this on to Mrs Reding and Mr Barroso."
"We would have liked this launch to have been more than a formal statement; we would also have liked the promise that was originally made to have been kept, namely that Parliament will be involved and that the agencies of civil society must be involved."
"Now this has not happened."
"We can still make up for this."
"However, we would appreciate it if there was more than simply a formal statement and the institutions cooperated to help rectify the particular example that I have just mentioned."
"My fellow Member, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, has mentioned other examples."
"On International Women's Day, there is one thing we Europeans must all acknowledge: in our continent, we still have not achieved equal rights, but the dramatic injustice towards women in other parts of the world, ranging from genital mutilation to the compulsory wearing of the veil, all these basic fundamental rights that women and, above all, girls worldwide are deprived of, should not only concern us on 8 March."
"For that reason, I would like to offer my thanks to the human rights experts in Parliament."
"Here, every Thursday afternoon during the Strasbourg week, we discuss, among other matters, human rights violations towards women."
"On International Women's Day, we should also say that these debates on Thursday afternoon deserve at least the sort of attendance that we have now in plenary."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am going to start by saying that this was a speech I did not expect to be making until a few moments ago, but it is important that we celebrate International Women's Day, and especially this one, some 100 years since this celebration was first proposed."
"It should be a day, yes, to celebrate how far women have come, but, yes, also to raise awareness about how much further we still have to travel in terms of equality."
"Mr President, you exhorted that there should be more women in this Parliament."
"The achievements are good but they are still not good enough."
"If I look at Parliament in my own country, some estimates say it will take us 200 years to reach parity at the current rate of progress, so we are not going fast enough to really achieve proper equality."
"The other issue that this Parliament is working on this week is human trafficking and violence against women."
"Last week, I visited an exhibition in my constituency at home with an exhibition of paintings and photographs of women who had been trafficked from a country next to our Union - Moldova - into our Union."
"Some estimates say that women - and, indeed, men - are being trafficked at a rate as high in numbers as was comparable with the whole of the African slave trade in 350 years, but women are the main victims."
"If we, as a European community, cannot do something about this and deal with the women who are the victims of that trade, then it would be a poor thing if we do not make progress on this day."
"The other issue we should concentrate on are the many women's health issues that have to be addressed and which are not given the time and energy that they should be."
"Much has been achieved, much can be celebrated, but there is very much more to do."
"International Women's Day, 8 March."
"I have celebrated this day for as long as I can remember, like my mother and grandmother before me."
"On 8 March, I sometimes become disheartened thinking of everything that must still be done for men and women to enjoy genuine equality of opportunity."
"There are so many women for whom violence is a day-to-day reality, so many women living in poverty, so many women having to single-handedly care for their children and parents; and so few women making it to the top in business, academia and politics."
"Yet then, I think of the generation of my grandmother, who had to stop work when she got married and had absolutely no educational opportunities, and that of my mother, who fought very hard to have a say in what happened to her own body, and I see how far we have come in the space of one century;"
"I see that change really is possible."
"We need to do our best now, however, if we are to make the world a better place in the near future."
"The European Union can make an important contribution, but only if it moves beyond fine words."
"The fight for equal rights has already been burdened by far too many fine words for far too long, and these have been joined by several more."
"On Friday, the Commission presented a Charter of Women's Rights containing very many fine words."
"I harbour a very healthy scepticism about its implementation."
"This scepticism is reinforced by the fact that the European Parliament and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were not consulted, as Mr Schulz has already said."
"Since this is Commissioner Reding's first act as the Commissioner responsible for equal opportunities, however, I am more than willing to give her the benefit of the doubt."
"The kind of initiatives with which she accompanies her fine words are what counts."
"If, in this period, she presents us with a directive to combat violence against women, a directive on paternity leave, strong measures to combat discrimination against women, strong measures to increase the female employment rate - for example, by improving the mutual compatibility of working hours and school hours - and quotas for women in top jobs, at least in her own ranks of the Commission, if the Commission translates its fine words into genuine action, my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and I will be the first to stand up and show our appreciation."
"If we want to see change, we need to work together: the Commission, the Council and the left and right in this House."
"Today, 8 March, is not only International Women's Day but also my son's birthday; he is two years old today."
"I hope with all my heart that, in 30 years' time, he will live in a Europe where he and his wife - or husband - share child care responsibilities equally, and where women have just as much chance of becoming a professor, CEO or European Commissioner."
"In the coming years, his mum will be doing her very best to achieve this, and fortunately I am not the only one."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, International Women's Day gives us a united opportunity to focus on issues and challenges women face today - to focus on the various forms of inequality that many women experience, but also to celebrate achievements by women throughout the century."
"We in the United Kingdom are especially proud to celebrate figures that have helped our nation progress in the field of women's rights: women such as Emily Pankhurst, leader of the British Suffragettes, which won women the right to vote, Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for her efforts in promoting human rights, especially for women, and Margaret Thatcher, the first British woman Prime Minister, elected in 1979."
"The issue of women reaching high positions and being given equal opportunities to men is just as relevant today as it was in the UK when the first female prime minister was elected."
"We can provide educational opportunities and employment, but the pay gap still remains."
"We can legislate against discrimination in the workplace, but we cannot legislate against the pressures of juggling work, family life and managing a home."
"As a parliament, we should be working towards assisting women to have a choice in what they do."
"If they choose to go into a career, they must be supported to do so on an equal playing field."
"If they chose to stay at home and bring up their family, they must not be undervalued."
"The phrase 'just a housewife' needs to be outlawed."
"No woman is 'just' anything."
"Each is valued for her contribution."
"So, if we talk about great women achievers, I believe one group of women must head the list and in the UK, we celebrate their contribution on 14 March, that is, the mothers of the world: the women who voluntarily give up their own ambitions and contribute their life to bringing up their children."
"For, by doing so correctly, they contribute towards a goal we all have - a society based on equality and tolerance, where human rights are respected, whatever your gender."
"Mr President, today we are celebrating International Women's Day and it is 15 years since the UN platform for women's rights was established."
"Halfway through the review which is now under way in New York, I and the other members of the delegation from the European Parliament can only say that women all over the world will have to content themselves with the status quo."
"Despite the positive resolutions recently adopted by Parliament, the Tarabella report and the resolution on Beijing +15, unfortunately, the UN meeting has not yet produced any results."
"The EU governments involved in the negotiations clearly have less challenging objectives on women's rights than the European Parliament expressed in the resolutions referred to earlier."
"Sometimes, it seems to me that the EU governments use the Beijing platform primarily as a means of lecturing non-EU countries about equality."
"It is often easier to tell other people what to do than to produce results oneself."
"Before he was elected, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, promised to draw up a Charter of women's rights."
"Today, we have had the chance to read the Commission's document."
"I and my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, are deeply concerned about the weakness of the content and the way in which the charter has been drawn up."
"There is a major risk that it will not be worth the paper it is written on."
"Parliament, the national bodies and the European voluntary organisations were not involved in and did not contribute to the charter and, of course, the citizens of Europe did not take part in the process either."
"I would like to explain to Mr Barroso that it is not enough to make a declaration about common values."
"What the women and the men of Europe need is a powerful document which has been developed and drawn up in collaboration with all the relevant parties."
"Let this be the first draft of a Charter of women's rights."
"Use the period until the next International Women's Day to hold debates and discussions with Parliament, the national bodies and the voluntary organisations in Europe."
"When we then celebrate the next International Women's Day, it will be clear that we have made progress."
"We are working to defend women's rights not just on 8 March, but on every day of the year."
"This is what the women and the men of Europe need."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, on this day, I wish to ask all politicians and legislators to stop issuing all these demagogic laws on equality that make life more difficult for women who wish to work."
"They are scaring organisations away from employing women."
"Equality is not about laws: it is about behaviour."
"As a working mother, in all my 30 years of professional life, I have never been recruited or promoted on anything other than my qualifications and merit, and I would be insulted if somebody gave me special treatment merely due to my chromosomes."
"However, I do have specific requests for this Parliament to defend the women of this world."
"I want the Spanish land-grab problem to be debated and resolved, to end the suffering of many women and men who risk demolition of their houses and cannot live in them."
"Do you not think this is violence?"
"I want this Parliament to stop the flow of EU funds to the regions where this enormous breach of human rights is taking place."
"Do you not think this is violence?"
"I want this Parliament to hear and protect those who want to communicate their concerns on structural irregularities affecting the European budget, as I did eight years ago, and ensure they do not suffer my fate."
"Is this not violence?"
"I want you to withhold discharge to the European Commission until the auditors clear 100% of the budget without reservations."
"This is how I wish this Parliament to honour the women and the men of Europe, those who, with their taxes, allow this European Union to exist."
"(HU) I would like to point out to my fellow Members that it is a grave mistake to talk in general about European women and the rights of women living in the European Union without taking into account the second-class position of women in Central and Eastern Europe's post-communist new Member States."
"The time has come for the EU to go on a fact-finding mission to investigate their particular lack of rights and, on the basis of the results, to remedy the existing serious discrimination among women inside Europe itself."
"Allow me to mention just two areas."
"Both are related to globalisation, the neoliberal economy, liberalised free trade and their drawbacks."
"The first is that multinational companies as well as large, EU-registered European firms, use different standards for labour law and occupational health."
"I am thinking, for instance, of large retailers, hypermarkets, such as those on both sides of the border between Austria and Hungary."
"The same company applies different standards concerning breaks, lunch time and notices of termination."
"They keep Eastern European, in this case Hungarian, female employees practically in slavery."
"The second area, completely unexplored, is the migration of women within the European Union."
"Women in a second-class position in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Hungarians, seek employment as domestic staff in the West, living as servants, as economic refugees, who often had to leave behind their children."
"From the point of view of their rights and dignity, their situation is much more like that of women in Third World developing countries than that of their sisters in Western Europe, who are fellow citizens of EU Member States."
"This calls for urgent redress."
"I would like to give a warm welcome to Commissioner Dalli."
"Welcome, Mr Dalli."
"The Commissioner will now make a statement on behalf of the Commission."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased that my first attendance at the plenary session of the European Parliament takes place on this important day - 8 March, International Women's Day."
"It is also an honour for me to represent the Commission, and in particular Vice-President Reding, who will lead the Commission's efforts to protect fundamental rights."
"This is a unique opportunity to collectively celebrate the economic, political and social achievements of women, past, present and future."
"In 1957, gender equality was enshrined in the European treaties."
"Since then, an impressive number of legal instruments, followed by a great number of decisions by the European Court of Justice, have created a legal arsenal at EU level."
"I would like to remind you that gender equality is not only a fundamental value enshrined in the treaty, but also that gender equality policies have proven to be a driver for economic growth."
"Last Friday, the President of the European Commission and Vice-President Reding renewed the Commission's commitment to the values of gender equality by presenting a Women's Charter."
"The Women's Charter represents the political commitment of the Commission to advance equality between women and men in five areas: equal economic independence; equal pay for equal work and work of equal value; equality in decision making; dignity, integrity and an end to gender-based violence; and gender equality beyond the Union."
"The Women's Charter will be followed, in September 2010, by a new comprehensive strategy for equality between women and men."
"This strategy will translate the principles of the Women's Charter into concrete actions to be implemented in the next five years."
"These are ambitious projects and objectives that the Commission will not be able to achieve alone."
"It will need to work in close cooperation with its main partners at EU level and, in particular, with you, the European Parliament and the FEMM Committee."
"International Women's Day is an excellent opportunity to remind us all of this commitment."
"That ends the speeches related not only to International Women's Day, but also to our constant efforts at achieving equal rights for women and eliminating violence."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(EL) Mr President, I am making the major assumption that the restoration of the public finances of a Member State of the euro area is the responsibility of the euro area itself."
"However, coordinated intervention is required in order to protect the common currency against speculation."
"The horrendous financial crisis in Greece and the financial imbalance in other Member States have highlighted the need for politically directed European economic governance."
"In my question to the Commission on 17 February 2010, I proposed that a European Monetary Fund be set up. I am delighted to see that Commissioner Rehn is moving in that direction."
"We shall await the Commission's integrated proposal."
"(ES) Mr President, a Spanish Central Criminal Court judge has confirmed what many of us were already aware of, namely that Hugo ChÃ¡vez, the President of Venezuela, cooperates with ETA and FARC terrorists."
"This proves that Mr ChÃ¡vez is in cahoots with terrorists, that he gives sanctuary to murderous terrorists on Venezuelan soil, and that he helps them by bestowing official positions in the Venezuelan Government upon them."
"Essentially, Mr ChÃ¡vez is cooperating with ETA criminals."
"As a Basque, a Spaniard and a European, I wish to denounce and condemn the appalling attitude of the dictator Hugo ChÃ¡vez."
"I urge the European institutions to take all necessary measures to condemn Mr ChÃ¡vez and thus also condemn his policies in support of terrorists."
"I would also remind Mr RodrÃ­guez Zapatero's government, which currently holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union, that there is no point in being friendly and wishy-washy with Mr ChÃ¡vez as it has been to date."
"There is no point either in displays of affection, or in friendly gestures and cooperation, because when the Spanish Government goes back on its word and humbles itself before Mr ChÃ¡vez as it has done recently, this is tantamount to punishing the victims of terrorism, disdaining the Spanish justice system and thereby punishing freedom and democracy."
"(ES) Mr President, Fidel Castro and his oligarchs betrayed the ideals of the Cuban revolution long ago."
"Those ideals had been shared by peoples the world over, especially the cream of international youth, whom they inspired."
"At present, however, the Castro brothers' dictatorship is characterised by a lack of compassion for political prisoners and prisoners of conscience, and for their own people."
"It puts me in mind of the period when Franco was on his deathbed, because of the mistreatment of political prisoners, who were also perceived as common criminals, and because of the same obsessive disdain towards exiles."
"Castro has ended up like Franco and all other enemies of freedom who become entrenched in power."
"Nonetheless, we are called upon to save lives and display solidarity with those who are fighting and suffering."
"That is our duty, as Europeans who are committed to democracy, freedom and human rights."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the Commission and the Spanish Presidency are very much stepping up the pace of negotiations with certain Central and South American countries in order to conclude association agreements before the May summit between the European Union and Latin America."
"As a Co-Vice President of EuroLat, I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that with some of these countries, there is a risk of accelerating negotiations whilst neglecting important points concerning human rights and the respect of human rights in various regions."
"For example, in Colombia, assassinations of trade unionists continue to happen practically on a daily basis."
"In Honduras, with whom we are negotiating an agreement, a government remains in place that is simply the product of a military coup d'Ã©tat which took place last year."
"In Guatemala, there are similar problems, not relating to human rights but concerning certain aspects of the agreements, which are being overlooked."
"I believe it is important that the Commission and the Presidency proceed with more caution."
